        "abstract": "In this work, we present an algebraic solution to the classical perspective-3-point (P3P) problem for determining the position and attitude of a camera from observations of three known reference points. In contrast to previous approaches, we first directly determine the cameras attitude by employing the corresponding geometric constraints to formulate a system of trigonometric equations. This is then efficiently solved, following an algebraic approach, to determine the unknown rotation matrix and subsequently the cameras position. As compared to recent alternatives, our method avoids computing unnecessary (and potentially numerically unstable) intermediate results, and thus achieves higher numerical accuracy and robustness at a lower computational cost. These benefits are validated through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations for both nominal and close-to-singular geometric configurations."

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a large number of heterogeneous and pervasive objects that continuously generate information about the physical world. These objects, through standard communication protocols and unique addressing schemes provide services to the final users or systems. IoT is envisioned to bring together billions of devices, also denoted as smart objects, by connecting them in an Internet-like structure, allowing them to communicate and exchange information and to enable new forms of interaction among things and people. Given the distributed nature of IoT applications, it is often the case that the application is modeled, developed and tested on each compute node, and connected to other nodes in the application network for achieving the end result. Therefore the deployment of application is also, more or less, done on each individual compute node. In this paper we propose an approach where the IoT application can be modeled in one place, where after modeling, the different pieces of application are annotated with location information, and based on this annotation, the application is decomposed into fragments that are deployed to corresponding individual compute nodes, automatically generating code to remotely connect the application fragments to other application fragments on other compute nodes in the edge or in the cloud."

PTV Vissim, the worlds leading microscopic traffic simulation tool, provides a virtual testbed to evaluate the coexistence of autonomous and conventional vehicles either in the transition phase or when vehicle fleets are fully autonomous. Vissim traffic simulation is increasingly being employed to address the evidence gap around the potential impacts of disruptive technologies, such as connected autonomous vehicles, on traffic flow and capacity. Incorporating hardware in the loop testing allows detailed representation of autonomous vehicle control algorithms, sensor and communication protocols to be simulated within a realistic virtual traffic environment. Simulating varying penetration rates of autonomous vehicles, and different behavioral characteristics such as as platooning, vehicle to vehicle communication and vehicle to infrastructure communication, has demonstrated the opportunity to reduce travel times by 11% and delays by more than 40%."

The target coverage region is discretized in a deployment map representation of non-penetrable obstacles. A probability detection model is utilized to represent sensors with variable distance coverage. The ACP is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and an iterative process is developed to solve the problem. The microgrid at Illinois Institute of Technology (IL Tech) is used as a practical example. Both the normal and the N-1 contingency deployments of sensors are simulated for optimizing the ACP at the IL Tech Microgrid."

        "abstract": "Massive MIMO is the currently most compelling sub-6 GHz wireless access technology for 5G. Since its inception about a decade ago, it has evolved from a wild “academic” idea to one of the most vibrant research topics in the wireless communications community, as well as a main work item in 5G standardization. The concept is to equip base stations with arrays of many antennas that serve many terminals simultaneously, in the same time-frequency resource. The arrays have attractive form factors: in the 2 GHz band, a halfwave-length-spaced rectangular array with 200 dual-polarized elements is about 1.5 × 0.75 meters large. Massive MIMO operates in TDD mode and the downlink beamforming exploits the uplink-downlink reciprocity of radio propagation. Specifically, the base station array uses channel estimates obtained from uplink pilots transmitted by the terminals to learn the channel in both directions. This makes Massive MIMO entirely scalable with respect to the number of base station antennas. Base stations operate autonomously, with no sharing of payload data or channel state information with other cells. In this talk I will discuss the development of Massive MIMO over the last five years, and outline the most important research problems ahead."

We use an extended TAM consisting of 9 constructs. A questionnaire is distributed to a total of 107 college English teachers from seven institutions of higher learning in South China. The results confirm that the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are key variables that positively influence teachers' intension to use mobile technologies. Self-efficacy is also found to be significantly related to teachers' behavior intention in using mobile devices in their classroom followed by the factor of mobile anxiety.

Models of both standards have been created within the EMTPATP and simulations performed using frequency dependent line models and realistic transformer models as terminations. It is observed that both standards are severely affected by the highly frequency selective nature of the MV power line channel and a more considered choice of OFDM parameters may be necessary for optimal performance on MV networks."

Two databases of the heart signal recordings from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the MIT PhysioNet were used as training, test and validation sets to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The system achieved an accuracy of 99%. The ECG signal is sensed using a flexible, dry, Graphene-based technology and the system is powered up by harvesting human thermal energy. The system architecture is implemented in Global foundries' 65 nm CMOS process, occupies 0.112 mm2 and consumes 2.78 micro Watt at an operating frequency of10 KHz and from a supply voltage of 1.2V.

Deep convolutional neural networks are being regarded today as an extremely effective and flexible approach for extracting actionable, high-level information from the wealth of raw data produced by a wide variety of sensory data sources. CNNs are however computationally demanding: today they typically run on GPU-accelerated compute servers or high-end embedded platforms. Industry and academia are racing to bring CNN inference (first) and training (next) within ever tighter power envelopes, while at the same time meeting real-time requirements. Recent results, including our PULP and ORIGAMI chips, demonstrate there is plenty of room at the bottom: pj/OP (GOPS/mW) computational efficiency, needed for deploying CNNs in the mobile/wearable scenario, is within reach. However, this is not enough: 1000x energy efficiency improvement, within a mW power envelope and with low-cost CMOS processes, is required for deploying CNNs in the most demanding CPS scenarios. The fj/OP milestone will require heterogeneous (3D) integration with ultra-efficient die-to-die communication, mixed-signal pre-processing, event-based approximate computing, while still meeting real-time requirements."

        "abstract": "In this talk, I would like to illustrate how human minds and brains may be approached scientifically, with a particular focus on human visual system and its cognitive characteristics. Understanding human cognition and behavior is essential for any information system, in particular in emerging fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, and Robotics, etc. Cognitive sciences involve studies on information systems, which obviously include humans, by examining what we can do (i.e., performances), what we cannot do (i.e., limits), what we are good or bad at (i.e., species-specific characteristics), and the extent to which we can change (plasticity). As cognitive science is interdisciplinary by its nature and the ranges of interests and issues vary, setting several must-follow principles would be vital; here I would list just several ones for handling human cognition and action: experimental attitude, complexity appreciation, appropriate reductionism, evolutional perspective, and understanding dynamically changing systems. Then, I shall discuss some important aspects of human cognition and action by showing visual demonstrations and discuss four issues in cognitive sciences. Bottom-up process versus Top-down process: Human cognition and actions are based on various automatic, stimulus-driven processes as well as deliberative, internally-driven processes. Although it is often difficult to disentangle these two processes, it is a good strategy to examine to what extent a phenomenon at hand is based on bottom-up processes and top-down processes. Interaction between Perception & Action: What we perceive is not necessarily identical to what we act on. Sometimes, perception and action are dissociable and sometimes they interact. Due to these dissociable and interacting bottom-up and top-down processes and the relationship between perceptual and action, we experience the complex mixture of conscious and unconscious effects."

The concept is based on separating leverage measurements from non-leverage measurements by a technique called diagnostic robust generalized potential (DRGP), which also takes care of the masking or swamping effect, if any. The methodology then detects the erroneous measurements from the generalized studentized residuals (GSR). The effectiveness of the method is validated with a small illustrative example, standard IEEE 14-bus and 123-bus unbalanced network models and compared with the existing methods. The method is demonstrated to be potentially very useful to detect attacks in smart power grid targeting leverage points in the system."

        "abstract": "The peer-to-peer transmission is a mainstream in challenged network environments. Yet, the free rider phenomenon in peer-to peer transmissions presses a need for incentive mechanisms to stimulate contributions of data transmission. As a result, it is imperative to answer the questions: whether and to what extent an incentive mechanism can invoke such contributions? To answer these questions, we employ an n-player continuous quantum game model to analyze extrinsic incentive mechanisms (promoting cooperative behaviors by offering rewards), and use the quantum prisoner's dilemma model to analyze intrinsic incentive mechanisms (encouraging reciprocal cooperation by exploiting internal bounds). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to analyze incentive mechanisms for peer-to-peer transmissions from a quantum game perspective. Such a perspective is adopted because the extended strategy space in the quantum game broadens the range for searching optimal strategies and the introduction of entanglement makes the proposed analytical frameworks more practical due to the consideration of the peers' relationships in decision-making. Our proposed quantum game-based analytical frameworks are generic because they are compatible with classic game-based schemes. Our analytical results can provide straightforward insights on evaluating the potential of incentive mechanisms and can serve as important references for designing new incentive mechanisms."

Firstly, a greedy construction heuristic is used to construct an initial solution, and then a local search algorithm is used to improve the solution. In addition, some improvements are made in some phases of the algorithm according to the feature of rebalancing problem. Practice examples and comparison with the typical algorithm in the fields are made. The results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and it can produce good results.

Malignant brain tumors have become one of the major causes of human death in recent years. If the tumor can be classified correctly at an early stage, the chances of survival of patients can be improved. The most appropriate treatment to be selected for brain cancer depends on precisely identifying of tumor type, location, size and boundaries by the physicians. Thus, it is important using a computer-aided diagnosis / detection system to detect brain tumors successfully for radiologists and physicians. In this study, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Otsu's method, Region Growing and Self-Organizing Maps methods is used for the automatic segmentation of brain tumors on the MR images and results are compared with each other. Application software is designed with a user interface for this purpose. Thus, the ease of decision-making by physicians will be provided. Consequently, the application software will prevent errors and may be used as a secondary means for brain tumor segmentation. It has been shown in detailed test experiments on image dataset that designed application can detect brain tumors successfully."

Two transmitarrays each of 17×17 unit-cell elements are designed to operate at 12 GHz and 17.5 GHz. The peak gains of transmitarrays are 25.31 dBi and 27.1 dBi, respectively. An alternating replacement of the unit-cell elements from the transmitarrays designed at 12 GHz and 17.5 GHz are employed.

The vision subsystem features a webcam that captures photos from the board. The aim is to detect, by means of classification techniques, whether a square is occupied by a piece, and in such a case whether the piece is black or white. Using matrix models, it is possible to determine the last movement executed by the human opponent.

The current deep learning based method is not efficient and requires huge consumption of data and power, which has a long latency running on data servers. With the emergence of autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles and robotics, there is a huge demand to only analyze a necessary sensed data with small latency and low power at edge devices. In this talk, we will discuss efficient machine-learning algorithms such as fast least-squares method, binary and tensory convolutional neural network method, with according prototyping accelerator developed in FPGA and CMOS-ASIC chips, which has potential to outperform traditional GPU devices. The mapping on future RRAM device will be also briefly addressed."

How to develop and make use of it has become a great challenge for enterprises.At the same time, the data pile up makes the processing cycle longer, and the complexity of the structure makes the processing difficulty and calculation increase.However, these data are discrete and can not find the correlated relationship between them. Leads to failure to retrieve their hidden information and to search for potential behind faults or threats. It can not provide effective decision support for fault diagnosis and value discovery.Therefore, this paper aims at the data obtained by sensors and monitoring systems in industry. A data association method based on directed graph is proposed, and the calculation of relational strength and temporal proximity is added. Finally, experiments show the validity and accuracy of the proposed method."

Theoretical analysis based on multi-parametric programming theory points out the unique one-to-one mapping between load and LMP vectors. Such one-to-one mapping is depicted by the concept of system pattern region (SPR) and identifying SPRs is the key to understanding the LMP-load coupling. Built upon the characteristics of SPRs, the SPR identification problem is modeled as a classification problem from a market participant's viewpoint, and a Support Vector Machine based data-driven approach is proposed. It is shown that even without the knowledge of system topology and parameters, the SPRs can be estimated by learning from historical load and price data. Visualization and illustration of the proposed datadriven approach are performed on a 3-bus system as well as the IEEE 118-bus system."

Vision-based systems can detect fires in open spaces from distances and detect the fire at an early stage. In this study, a fire/flame detection method based on the color analysis of the fire image is presented. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, the image in RGB space is converted to the HSI color space. Then a color filter is applied to determine the fire/flame candidate zone. In the second stage, fake fire zones within the candidate zone identified as fire are eliminated. In this phase, image difference and gauss mixture model is used to recover the fake fire areas. In the third step, the result of the two methods is subjected to AND processing. The AND operation ensures to detect the exact flame zone. As a result, the proposed algorithm has been tested using fire video images. The highest calculated accuracy is 96%."

EEG records of 4 epileptic patients having 6 consecutive seizures were taken from the MIT EEG database. The signals were transferred to the timefrequency plane using Wavelet Transform (WT), where the energy values were investigated in delta, teta, alpha and beta sub-frequency bands. Then, the data was analyzed with statistical program and significant differences were observed. In conclusion, the method proposed in this study is thought to contribute to the diagnosis and treatment process by detecting brain oscillations between the seizures of epileptic."

The optimized communication strategies are more crucial for these types of networks by considering routing, power management, MAC layer management. In this paper, a novel power efficient MAC scheme is proposed for saving the energy and improving the life time of the network. We considered the ACO optimization technique for optimal path selection and lower the overhead at node level. Delay, throughput and average energy consumption is parameters are considered to improve the efficiency of the network."

Metamorphic Testing (MT) is a testing technique that exploits the relationships among the inputs and outputs of multiple executions of the program under test, so- called Metamorphic Relations (MRs). MT has been proven highly effective in testing programs that face the oracle problem, for which the correctness of individual output is difficult to determine. Since the introduction of MT in 1998, the interest in this testing methodology has grown immensely with numerous applications in various domains such as machine learning, bioinformatics, computer graphics, simulation, search engines, decision support, cloud computing, databases, and compilers. The Second International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing (MET) will bring together researchers and practitioners in academia and industry to discuss research results and experiences in MT. The ultimate goal of MET is to provide a platform for the discussion of novel ideas, new perspectives, new applications, and state of research, related to or inspired by MT."

These dependable systems frequently implement non-trivial mechanisms, for example, to coordinate between redundant components, and a guarantee of correctness of these mechanisms is therefore crucial to avoid catastrophic incidents. Consequently, formal methods are frequently used in industrial dependable system design and in this talk I will discuss the various aspects in which formal methods are and have been deployed for specification, verification, and configuration at TTTech for critical networking products."

The proposed model also allows using null time constants and thus simplifies the computer implementation of the DAEs. The properties and the performance of the proposed semi-implicit formulation and the conventional explicit one are compared through a dynamic 21,177-bus model of the European transmission system."

A broader definition of Semantic Computing includes the computing technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, natural language, software engineering, data and knowledge engineering, computer systems, signal processing, etc.), and their interactions, that may be used to extract or process computational content. This connection between content and the user is made via Semantic Analysis, which analyzes content with the goal of converting it to machine processable descriptions (semantics); Semantic Integration, which integrates content and semantics from multiple sources; Semantic Applications, which utilize content and descriptions to solve problems; and Semantic Interface, which interprets users' intentions expressed in natural language or other communicative forms. The reverse connection converts the intentions of users to create content via analysis and synthesis techniques. This talk introduces Semantic Computing based on its broader and narrower definitions, its relationship with Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Computing and Informatics, and other branches of Computer Science. It also discusses several case studies showing how it can be used to solve more complex problems."

We especially provide some numerical data by recalculating for rectangular apertures greater than the half-wavelength with an improved calculation code, since the calculation code developed in the past has some errors for the case of the large apertures. In addition, we visualize the power flow around the aperture by means of the 2D vector plot of the Poynting vector to see the state of the diffraction."

Several mechanisms are designed to better orchestrate traffic between the memory controller and NAND flash to alleviate the speed discrepancy issue. We also propose a proactive GC scheme for the NVDIMM controller and flash controller to intelligently synchronize and transfer data involving in forthcoming GC operations. Our experimental results show that overall the proposed techniques yield 10%∼35% performance improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline schemes."

The AXIOM platform is built with, in mind, the possibility of executing an application not only on a single board but also, in a distributed fashion, on multiple boards. While this is a classic problem with some solutions in the case of no constraints, it becomes interesting for embedded computing and cyber-physical systems where we aim to accelerate applications while maintaining energy efficiency and also easy programmability. Currently, the AXIOM platform consists of a custom board based on the Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ ZU9EG which incorporates the largest FPGA available on that System-on-Chip at the moment, four 64-bit ARM cores and two 32-bit ARM cores, up to 32GiB of main memory and several 12.5Gbit/s tranceivers. We relyed on this hardware to develop our novel concept, which exploitsdataflow execution in multiple ways for programs that are written in an OpenMP extension, known as OmpSs. A key aspect relates to the adopted memory consistency model, which allows the programmer to focus on aspects other than taking care of the communication among nodes. The lower level of our communication stack relies on a fast interconnect based on inexpensive USB-C type connectors rather than on other proprietary interfaces. The reconfigurable logic provides a complete Network Interface Card (NIC) to allow fast routing of the data and code of the system. We envision many applications for this platform although we are currently focused on developing two basic scenarios based on the Smart-Home and on Smart-Video surveillance. Our initial results confirm good scalability of the platform and a speed-up compared to other programming models such as Cilk and OpenMPI."

Based on a typical model, the inclusion of error integrals in the Lyapunov functions allow the UAV to achieve the desired set points without steady state error despite of changes in plant parameters and sensors noise. The results are compared in simulations to another nonlinear controller to show the robustness of the proposed strategy to disturbance in plant and outputs."

Android malware is one of the major security issues and fast growing threats facing the Internet in the mobile arena, today. So, in this context, DNS (Domain Name System) is widely misused by miscreants in order to provide internet connection within malicious networks and botnets. In our experiments, we use the MalGenome dataset in order to generate network traffic. Besides, most of the malware we examine use DNS in order to obtain the IP address of their command and control servers. Then, the problem of determining the DNS queries done by the malware through devices without modifying the firmware or rooting smartphone, is very important and it poses a big challenge. From traces we generated from apps under test, we can extract malicious URLs invoked by the malware."

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) embed HW/SW devices that implement controlling strategies of physical processes. Such strategies are usually designed as architecture agnostic mathematical models, that are unaware of constraints imposed by the embedded HW platform. As such, the developed strategy may be unable to control the actual system. This implies the need of cyber-physical virtual-platforms (VPs), where an abstract control algorithm can be refined up to its actual SW implementation. This speech investigates the main methodologies for extending standard embedded VPs to cyber-physical VPs that integrate continuous-time components, like sensors and analog interfaces. We examine the theoretical problem of integrating different models of computations and its practical solution through co-simulation, particularly based on the FMI/FMU standards. However, computational bottlenecks discourage in using co-simulation in real cases, thus more innovative solutions must be used, like the automatic abstraction of IP components. Such techniques are mature and well developed if applied to digital IPs, while they are in their infancy for analog IPs. However, the speech presents innovative and affective approaches in this field. Finally, a cyber-physical VP is also useful for checking and estimating extra-functional properties like power consumption, temperature, ageing and functional safety. This would require the integration of plenty of tools, or the generation of extra-functional models to be integrated in the same cyber-physical VP, which becomes the core tool for CPSs design, validation and optimization."

In this study, an approach based on clustering and morphological image processing has been proposed for detection of retinal exudates. Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization technique is used to make the location of the exudate areas more specific. In addition, the k-means clustering algorithm determines the locations of candidate regions. According to experimental results, it was observed that a majority of the pixels of the exudate regions were detected."

This is because such sensors can achieve high accuracy (<; 0.1C error) after a single room-temperature calibration. Although resistor-based temperature sensors can achieve higher resolution and energy-efficiency, they usually require multi-point calibration to reach similar levels of accuracy. In a recent breakthrough, we have discovered that temperature sensors based on silicided poly resistors are an exception to this rule. Two temperature sensor architectures will be presented that use such resistors to achieve good accuracy (<;0.2C) after a one or two-point calibration, as well as state-of-the-art energy-efficiency and resolution."

To help educators focus on teaching, MathWorks offers tools and resources that instructors can use for development of hardware labs and learning materials. In this talk we will discuss such tools and resources, including: • Free hardware support packages and experiments enabling students to control drones, drive motors, read encoders, use light sensors, and build other projects with popular platforms like LEGO, Arduino, and Parrot Minidrones straight from MATLAB and Simulink. • Online resources for self-learning including MATLAB Tech Talks, tutorials, and MATLAB Academy. • MATLAB and Simulink capabilities for easier and more intuitive explanation of controls concepts. • Downloadable sets of curriculum materials for developing and enhancing curriculum, facilitating lectures and classroom examples, and inspiring student learning. • MATLAB Cody Coursework for auto-grading assignments. • Access to MATLAB and Simulink through campus wide licenses, student software, MATLAB Online, MATLAB Home, and MATLAB Mobile."

        "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in mobile or autonomous applications, which are for systems that do not need and do not have the possibility of refueling power. The used power must come from the environment by harvesting what is available and transforming it into electrical form. Those systems move around, i.e. they are they nomadic and often are connected object and we call this category IoT. Since available power is very low its consumption becomes a key design parameter. Moreover, transducers transforming the harvested energy into electricity often give rise to very low voltage. The result is that the analog circuits of nomadic applications must work with sub 1-V supply voltages and power consumption in the tens of hundreds of nW range. Digital circuits are power efficient and for very low power circuits they ensure a better sensitivity to supply noise than analog counterparts. Therefore, for modem nomadic systems moving quickly to digital is an essential strategy. Ensuring ultra-low power atmedium-high resolution (9–12 bit) forrelatively low signal bandwidth (100 kHz–1 MHz) is a typical request. SAR converters and sigma-delta modulators are used. Techniques and recent circuit implementations capable of satisfying diverse ranges of specificationsfor mobile and autonomous systems are presented."

A modified neighbor-based formation control algorithm with time-varying is constructed. Employing Lyapunov-Razumikhin theorem and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) approach, respectively, the formation consensus conditions are derived to guarantee the agents achieve and maintain the desired formation in a fixed directed network. Moreover, LMIs approach for a fixed directed network can be extended straightforwardly to switching directed networks. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results."

If you'd rather deploy models on your own website, or in your mobile app, that is surprisingly easy as well. With powerful tools for Monte Carlo simulation and risk analysis, conventional and stochastic optimization, forecasting, data mining and text mining built in, you can use Analytic Solver to quickly build and deploy models that yield real business impact. We'll demonstrate these capabilities in our Vendor Tutorial session at WSC 2017."

        "abstract": "In 1947, John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley invented the transistor. Ten years later, the first integrated circuit was built and in 1968, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore founded the Intel company. Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors on a die would double every year. In 1975, four years after the introduction of the first microprocessor, he updated his prediction, saying that the growth would then slow down to a doubling every two years. Such a growth rate leads to multiply the number of transistors by 1000 every 20 years. The first microprocessor had 2300 transistors in 1971. In 1991, Intel launched the 486SX with 1.2M transistors and in 2011, the Sandy Bridge processors reached 500M transistors. Whhat did we do with this transistor budget? If the Moore's law continues for another 20 years, in 2037, we should reach 1 Trillion transistors. WThat will we do with them? These are the questions we will address in the presentation, looking at microarchitectural techniques to increase performance such as pipelining, superscalar and out-of-order execution, multiple core and manvcore designs."

        "abstract": "SoCs have benefitted immensely from the >1000× linear scaling of Silicon. However, interconnecting die on PCBs has not scaled appreciably in the last several decades and we have had to rely on complex power hungry serializers and deserializers. That is changing now and we show that it can have significant impact on the way we design and integrate complex systems as well as their performance. At UCLA, we have been developing a Simple Universal Parallel IntERface (Super) for the heterogeneous integration of diverse hard IP. Such methods promise to reduce the NRE by 10–20× and reduce the time to market from a few years to a few months, potentially democratizing the chip design and system integration business."

This methodology involves finding connected subgraphs that maximize a certain anomaly function, but maximizing these functions is computationally hard in general. We develop a novel approach for graph scan statistics with connectivity constraints. Our algorithm Approx-MultilinearScan relies on an algebraic technique called multilinear detection, and it improves over prior methods for large networks. We also develop a Pregel-based parallel version of this algorithm in Giraph, MultilinearScanGiraph, that allows us to solve instances with over 40 million edges, which is more than one order of magnitude larger than existing methods."
