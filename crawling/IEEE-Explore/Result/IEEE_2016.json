While most attribute learning methods are supervised by costly human-generated labels, we introduce a simple yet powerful unsupervised approach to learn and predict visual attributes directly from data. Given a large unlabeled image collection as input, we train deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to output a set of discriminative, binary attributes often with semantic meanings. Specifically, we first train a CNN coupled with unsupervised discriminative clustering, and then use the cluster membership as a soft supervision to discover shared attributes from the clusters while maximizing their separability. The learned attributes are shown to be capable of encoding rich imagery properties from both natural images and contour patches. The visual representations learned in this way are also transferrable to other tasks such as object detection. We show other convincing results on the related tasks of image retrieval and classification, and contour detection."

Several experimental results have proven to the effectiveness and performance of BA. However, BA may fail to find the global optimal solution occasionally. In this paper, a kind of classical search technology, called variable neighborhood search (VNS), is incorporated into BA as a local search tool. An improved version of BA namely variable neighborhood bat algorithm (VNBA), is thus proposed. In VNBA, the classic BA as a global search tool searches the whole space globally, and this can significantly shrink the search space. Subsequently, VNS as a local search tool is implemented to find the final best solution within the small promising area. After that, the VNBA is benchmarked by sixteen standard benchmark functions. The experimental results imply that VNBA takes the absolute advantage over the basic BA."

Existing tools and techniques do not allow one to verify directly these properties, expressed as behavioral equivalences. We propose a different approach: we design two conditions on protocols which are sufficient to ensure anonymity and unlinkability, and which can then be effectively checked automatically using ProVerif. Our two conditions correspond to two broad classes of attacks on unlinkability, corresponding to data and control-flow leaks. This theoretical result is general enough to apply to a wide class of protocols. In particular, we apply our techniques to provide the first formal security proof of the BAC protocol (e-passport). Our work has also lead to the discovery of new attacks, including one on the LAK protocol (RFID authentication) which was previously claimed to be unlinkable (in a weak sense) and one on the PACE protocol (e-passport)."

In addition, this research verifies that greenwash is negatively related to both of green brand image and green satisfaction that would positively influence green brand equity. This paper also proves that green brand image and green satisfaction mediate the negative relationship between greenwash and green brand equity. Hence, this study suggests that companies should reduce their greenwash behaviors and raise their green brand image and green satisfaction to enhance their green brand equity."

Unlike battery-powered wireless sensor networks, EH-WSNs are powered by energy harvested from ambience. This change calls for new designs on routing protocols in EH-WSNs. This paper proposes a novel energy-aware distributed clustering routing protocol for EH-WSNs, it takes the node current residual energy and the harvested energy in a short term prediction horizon into cluster heads election process of the distributed clustering routing. A neural network based solar energy prediction model is exploited to make the protocol energy-aware. Nodes with higher residual energy and stronger energy harvesting capabilities thus have higher probability of being cluster heads. The proposed routing algorithm is compared with LEACH (low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) in terms of the number of awake nodes and network throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed clustering routing has stronger ability to balance energy consumption among sensor nodes and increases the network throughput by about 30% over LEACH."

However, the underlying independent and identically distributed condition of the interference is violated, which induces performance degradation of jamming suppression. In this paper, we propose a robust adaptive beamforming approach based on direct data domain technique for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar with FDA as transmit array, referred to as FDA-MIMO. In this approach, the data is smoothed once in transmit and receive domains to mitigate the influence of target, which results in three homogeneous samples. In the sequel, the data collected from different pulses is utilized as secondary data. Basically, the interference can be isolated from the target signal in the joint transmit and receive domains of the FDA-MIMO radar. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

This scenario is impractical to study developers as they actually work on large software artifacts. To overcome this an Eclipse plugin, iTrace, is introduced that monitors developers eye movements even in the presence of scrolling and file switching within an IDE. In addition, it automatically maps the eye gaze to source code elements. Existing work using iTrace is presented followed by a scenario of how to setup and run an eye tracking study. Data filtering, data cleaning, and data analysis are also discussed."

This protocol provides secure and efficient multicast authentication for frequent message transmissions in short session time interval. The protocol solves the problem of shared key among communicating group with its consequence of possible masquerade attack by introducing a novel use of secret sharing scheme. That is, the secret is used as an authenticator and its shares are used as authentication keys. Each share is designated to a specific recipient in a specific time through a challenge known only to the sender and that recipient. The share can be linked back to the secret and, hence, the message source can be authenticated. In addition, the protocol enables multicasting several messages in a specific time slots within a transmission session. Security evaluation of the protocol shows that it fulfills the stated security requirements and addresses the listed attacks. Performance evaluation of the protocol shows that it is lightweight in terms of computation and communication costs, thus addressing the resource-constrained IoT endpoints."

This is achieved by using a linearized small signal model of the converter system and its controls. The model is validated via electromagnetic transients simulation of the fully detailed large signal model. An interesting result from this study is that the maximum power transfer capability of the VSC-HVdc converter is affected by the PLL gains, and that the theoretical limit (obtained from static voltage stability analysis) is approachable as the PLL gains become very small. This paper shows that gains of the PLL, particularly at low SCRs greatly affect the operation of the VSC-HVdc converter and that operation at low SCRs approaching 1.3 is very difficult."

Although SDN provides promising solutions to many security problems, it is also exposed to new attacks targeting the data plane, the control plane, or the links connecting the two planes. Race conditions exist between the data plane and control plane which increases the packet forwarding delay. This paves the way for switch DOS attack. The race condition is mitigated and switch DOS attack is provented. Evaluuation results show that the performance of the network is enhanced and significantly SDN is prevented from switch Dos attack."

This paper proposed a hierarchical structure for the electricity market to facilitate the coordination of energy markets in distribution and transmission networks. The proposed market structure enables the integration of microgrids, which provide energy and ancillary services in distribution networks. In the proposed hierarchical structure, microgrids participate in the energy market at the distribution networks settled by the distribution network operator (DNO), and load aggregators (LAs) interact with microgrids and generation companies (GENCOs) to import/export energy to/from the distribution network electricity markets from/to the wholesale electricity market. The proposed approach addressed the synergy of energy markets by introducing dynamic game with complete information for GENCOs, microgrids, and LAs. The proposed hierarchical competition is composed of bi-level optimization problems in which the respective upper-level problems maximize the individual market participants' payoff, and the lower-level problems represent the market settlement accomplished by the DNO or the independent system operator. The bi-level problems are solved by developing sensitivity functions for market participants' payoff with respect to their bidding strategies. A case study is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Aggregators could optimally manage the charging/discharging of the EVs, to not only maximize the consumers' welfare in response to real-time prices and accommodate their needs for transportation, but also to keep the distribution network within its operating limits. This paper proposes a decentralized framework in which the aggregator seeks to maximize its profits while the consumers minimize their costs in response to time-varying prices, and additional incentives provided to mitigate potential overloads in the distribution system. Test results show that a large penetration of EV penetration can then be managed without violating the capacity of the distribution network."

In this work we propose new algorithms for multi-agent distributed iterative value function approximation where the agents are allowed to have different behavior policies while evaluating the response to a single target policy. The algorithms assume linear parametrization of the value function and are based on consensus-based distributed stochastic approximation. Under appropriate assumptions on the time-varying network topology and the overall state-visiting distributions of the agents we prove weak convergence of the parameter estimates to the globally optimal point. It is demonstrated that the agents are able to together reach this solution even when the individual agents cannot."

The system is found to deliver excellent performance in sensor data collection and fire detection. On the other hand, node localization is achieved at an accuracy of ¬± 8.50 cm for both coordinates."

In this work, we propose a hybrid OCR system for printed Nepali text using the Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning technique. It incorporates two different approaches of OCR - the Holistic and the Character level recognition. The system first tries to recognize word as a whole; if it is not confident about the word being recognized, then the character level recognition is performed. Histogram Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptors are used to define a feature vector of a word or character. The recognition rates of approximately 78.87% and 94.80% are achieved for character level recognition method and the Hybrid method respectively."

Here the network is clustered according to Tnergy-Efficient Distance-based Clustering (EEDC) algorithm. For each cluster head, a set of backup nodes are selected using genetic algorithm based on the sponsored coverage and residual energy parameters. This helps in detecing the faults occurring in cluster heads. Simulation results show that the proposed technique minimizes the energy loss and overhead."

To accommodate the ever-increasing demands of different multimedia services and applications, the evolving next-generation wireless access networks are envisioned to support 1,000-fold gains in capacity, connections for billions of diverse devices, and Gb/s individual user data rates. Massive MIMO has emerged as a promising technology to deal with such challenges. Through the use of an excessively large number of service antennas in a fully coherent and adaptive operation, transmission and reception of signal energy can be focused into small regions to offer large improvements in throughput and energy efficiency, especially when combined with multi-user scheduling and in mmWave bands. Furthermore, massive MIMO can enhance the robustness to interference and intentional jamming. The talk will provide an overview from MIMO, SU-MIMO, MU-MIMO, network-MIMO to massive MIMO developments applicable to next-generation wireless access communications, and highlight various technical issues and solutions."

The main contribution of our research work is the design of a novel social media analytics framework on top of Apache Spark for predicting and visualizing consumers' opinion orientations based on their relationships with other consumers whose opinion orientations are known. In particular, we explore state-of-the-art collective classification (CC) algorithms for predicting consumers' opinion orientations. Based on real-world data collected from Sina Weibo, our experiments show that the proposed Gibbs sampling based CC algorithms which consider both a user's local features and their relational features outperform another approach that considers relational features alone."

The first layer, the data collection and control layer, collects and sends environmental and control data to the second layer. And, the second layer, energy management based on context-awareness layer, analyses the data and infers the context from them. Finally, the energy service layer provides energy management services to users through monitoring and controlling the status of energy consumption. Using the proposed scheme, users can monitor their energy consumption, and control their utilities and equipment to avoid energy leakage."

Enhanced Shock Burst technology is provided for addressing of the devices during the formation of wireless network. However, it allows to connect on the same frequency only a small number of devices, which complicates the creation of a large-scale multi-user network. In this regard, an algorithm that allows to enlarge capabilities of these transceivers and, consequently, capabilities of wireless sensor network was developed. This algorithm uses a special commands embedded in data packets of measurement information, and it allows to increase the network opportunities at the software level. Thus the algorithm does not exclude checking the integrity of packages on the physical level."

How to ensure safety and reliability of civil plane has attracted more and more attention by many research institutes and researchers. As one of the most important part in the civil plane, how to ensure normal operation of aero-engine becomes particularly important. According to statistics, the sensor fault accounts for more than 80% of the total failures in the aero-engine system. In this paper, an aero-engine model is established according to the operational principle of aero-engine using AMESim software. Secondly, the sensor sub-model in above model is modified to simulate drift failure, bias fault, and pulse fault, and to achieve aero-engine sensors' fault data. After that, sensor fault diagnosis model is built based on principle component analysis. Online detection and diagnosis can be realized using this diagnosis model. Simulation results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective."

The construction of these domains depends on the specific representation chosen for the power flow equations, so that different representations lead to different domains. Given this domain, there is a simple efficient algorithm that will either find a solution in the domain, or certify that no solutions exist in it. We validate the approach on several IEEE test cases."

Our main purpose is to find OOV words that can be added into the Myanmar dictionary. The outcome of our method are new compound words that do not exist in the Myanmar dictionary. Our method consists of two steps. In the first step, we extract maximal substrings, i.e., the substrings whose number of occurrences are decreased only after appending a character before or after them, from Myanmar news articles. In the second step, we make the post-processing of maximal substrings, because the results obtained by maximal substrings contain noisy characters. Our post-processing is threefold. First, we reduce the number of maximal substrings. Second, we remove maximal substrings whose prefixes and suffixes are meaningless characters. Third, we find OOV words that are the substrings consisting of the two words from the existing dictionary. Consequently, we obtain the substrings as candidates of new compound words that can be inserted into the existing Myanmar dictionary after being scrutinized by native speakers. We evaluate the accuracy of new compound words by using the subjective perspective. It is found that our results do seem promising. We appeal that new compound words obtained by our method are useful for expressing the words as a single unit of meaning that can be utilized in Myanmar text effectively."

A square patch is embedded as a parasitic element at the center of the rotating slot to increase the impedance bandwidth. Rectangular slots are cut in the square patch to compensate the return loss. A pair of E-shaped parasitic patches along the 50 ohm microstrip line is used to introduce additional resonance excitation which can enhance the bandwidth. The proposed antenna is successfully manufactured and experimentally investigated. The measured results are in good agreement with the simulation results. The impedance bandwidth is found to be 74.4% ranging from 2.45 GHz to 5.35 GHz.

The low frequency subband with lower sparseness is disposed with sparse representation, construct over complete dictionary, solve sparse coefficient over the trained dictionary, and choose the low frequency coefficients with the larger energy fusion rule. And the rule of gradient absolute value maximization is applied to the high frequency subbands. Then the fusion image is obtained by the inverse Shearlet transform.

By the wind to its maximum extent it is necessary to place the wind turbine at the place where the losses of the system and the size of the turbine are minimum.

        "abstract": "The paper substantiates an electrical circuit with separate balancing and two extended properties: extended functional capabilities and balancing all definable parameters by means of varistors only. The authors describe the way to make such bridging. Initial bridge circuit has been selected and the method to change its loop containing balancing elements has been defined, with such method comprising the substitution of the single resistor by a multielement port that is equivalent to the port of the controlled, diagnosed, measured or investigated object. It is proved that such loop in the bridge circuit can provide for the bridge circuit extended functional capability even if it is balanced by varistors only. The paper contains examples of equilibrium conditions in the obtained bridge circuit for two variants of controlled objects that are reverse two-terminal networks. The proposed bridge circuit, like the initial one, belongs to quasibalanced bridges, because voltage spikes, that occur at the onset of the output pulse and at its termination and contain sum-totals of exponential summands fading to the zero within the transient time period, are not reduced to zero."

        "abstract": "With the landmark introduction of Smartphone in 2007, Mobile Internet and computing took off and the associated data bandwidth continue to grow exponentially. To satisfy the ever-increasing computing requirements, mobile CPU clock frequencies have exceeded GHz. However, the technology will soon hit a frequency wall beyond which cost becomes prohibitively high. Thus, mobile clients are rapidly moving to multi-core CPU and GPU to enable consumer applications and mobile human-interface devices (HIDs), with system-adaptive power management, thermal throttling, and heterogeneous multi-processing, for optimal performance and energy efficiency within thermal limits. The insatiable computation need, coupled with the explosion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and wearable devices for long battery operation will continue to driver the IC technology forward. But, with the constraints of portable-device form factors and limited battery-technology improvement, the energy and thermal gaps present major technical challenges. To overcome these challenges, many innovations are desperately needed to enable the ubiquitous ecosystem that promises to provide ample possibilities to enhance and enrich everyone's life."

This system takes tango dance patterns performed by human dancers as input and produces choreographies that are represented in a 3 dimensional (3D) virtual environment. Dance figures obtained by a motion capture system are segmented automatically and analyzed with regard to center of mass to form the dance database. Choreographies are then created by combining compatible primitives and adapting them. The system is tested using both objective metrics such as the accuracy of the motion primitive segmentation as well as the subjective scores about the fluency and quality of the dance patterns, and is proven to be effective."

Although \"they save lives\", these UAVs were still too expensive and inaccessible to civilians. As of 2012, USAF deployed about 7500 UAVs. Starting in the 1990's, research programs were introduced in the robotics community to develop and miniaturize UAV technology for civilian use. Based on this work, a final-year project was done in 2005 at HKUST, aiming to develop a helicopter flight controller. Later, Frank Wang went on to found a UAV company by the name of DJI and introduced the Phantom family, a series of ready-to-fly UAVs equipped with gimbal-stabilized cameras. Combining consumer-level price and good user experience, the Phantom quickly became a popular device among hobbyists, filmmakers, and consumers. A new market for easy-to-fly aerial robotics that anyone could use emerged. Today the Phantoms are widely utilized in aerial photography/filmmaking, agriculture, sports, and infrastructure inspection and more. The drone market in 2015 is expected to break the one million unit benchmark."

Then we can acquire the optimal decision value with maximum profit of manufacturers and retailers by model solution, to improve individual and entire benefit in closed-loop supply chain. The model verifies that when residual value of recycling product is large, the recovery rate of manufacturer and retailer will be also high, and the supply chain can obtain higher profit correspondingly."

Based on the obtained conditions, the mode-dependent filter gains are further designed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results."

This paper discusses the fuel requirements for driving the chemical processes are the starting point for the assessment. These are found to be rather similar through-out the industry, with only minor differences between different facilities. Higher chemical varability increases the heat requirements as more heat is required for the reactions and the reaction temperatures are higher. Thermal efficiency is primarily determined by the thermal recuperation of heat contained in the fuel combustion exhaust gases and the intermediate product, clinker. This heat is recuperated in preheaters and clinker coolers respectively. The factors that drive efficient heat recuperation are discussed and simple performance assessment indicators provided. Operators who pay close attention to their thermal performance can reduce operating costs and obtain a competitive advantage in the market."

        "abstract": "The cement industry relies upon silos for storage of materials throughout the process of the creation of cement. Many arrive on site at a production facility fully realizing that mechanical systems and equipment need maintenance, but never think twice about their storage structures. Unfortunately, this can lead to tragic consequences for facility personnel as attested to by past failures. Many factors affect the behavior of storage silos. From the type of silo (raw material, blending, clinker, finish cement, and beyond), reclaim system, feeding system, construction date, contractor, design engineer, modifications to the structure, and more, there are many factors that can affect the behavior of a silo. Fortunately, silos typically give notices and warnings prior to failure. Observation of cracking patterns, concrete chunks in reclaim, delaminating and spalling concrete, and others can be sure indicators that something unintended is happening with your silos. A silo inspection by an experienced engineer can make sense of what the silo is telling us. Not all cracks are created the same, and different cracking patterns mean different issues. Silos, especially those around cement production, have their own unique issues. From abrasion and impact loads, to asymmetric flow, over pressurization from pneumatic feed systems, rat holing and bridging, differential foundation settlement can lead to disastrous results that could be better managed with the creation and implementation of an inspection program. This paper will discuss: Some of these warning signs in detail,; Failure modes (from hopper to wall connection failures, wall damage, roof beam support issues and collapse) in silos,; Give owners tips on what to seek during their plant walk downs, and show how an inspection program can arm owners of silos, both at individual plants as well as a fleet of facilities with information for their future planning."

As one of the distinctive features of the material, measurement of the RI is nowadays used in many areas including the food, oil and petroleum industry, biomedical applications, and environmental analysis. In recent years, fiber optic based refractometers become highly popular thanks to the advantages they provide compared to other methods used in the above mentioned fields. Two fiber optic refractive index sensors were investigated in this study: Fresnel reflection based- and long-period fiber grating (LPFG) based-refractometers. The former uses SMF fiber tip as sensing point interrogated by an OTDR from a distant location, where the latter examines the changes in the resonance wavelength. Experimental work realised on different concentrations of glucose-water and glycerol-water solutions successfully demonstrated the capability of the proposed sensor in measuring RI of liquid chemicals with a precision of 1.7√ó10-4 (Fresnel-based sensor) and maximum sensitivity of 193.42 nm/RIU (LPGF based sensor)."

Accurate estimation of seismic signals is very important in geological structure studies. It is typical that the signal is corrupted by noise, especially during the data acquisition process. This results in the loss of important information embedded in the measured or the acquired data. This work proposes the particle filtering, a class of sequential Monte Carlo methods, along with the seismic wavelet model for the tracking of the seismic events of the noisy seismic signals. The method is evaluated on the synthetic noisy data with different noise levels. Moreover, the method is tested on multiple events seismic records to show its performance when the signals are more complex. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method delivers excellent seismic event estimates under noisy observations."

In order to simplify the coding method for genetic operation process, decimal integer coding method is used for variable encoding of rules. The optimization control strategy model is imported into vehicle model for simulation. The results show that the optimized control strategy based on improved genetic algorithm has better performance than basic genetic algorithm."

In order to achieve high data rates with good amount of spectral efficiency, it is required to allocate resources optimally. Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) is used to provide control information to the attached User equipment (UE). The resource elements to represent PDCCH are limited hence it is required to effectively allocate resources within this channel. The allocation of PDCCH resources for each UE is based on quantity of information and RB location depends on UE RNTI. This paper mainly focuses on effective method to allocate RNTI for UEs in order to minimize the Control Channel Element (CCE) collision. The proposed method of RNTI allocation has been compared with other existing methods using simulation."

It improves transient time in load regulation. This also can maintain range of wide load current, advantage of Dual mode buck converter. The proposed Dual Buck Converter is fabricated in 180nm CMOS 1-poly 6-metal process and occupies a core effective area of 1.35 mm2. Measurement environment are input voltage range of 2.7~3.3V, output voltage 1.2V and load current range from 10mA to 500mA. And measurement result shows that the maximum efficiency is 90% and ripple voltage is less 1.32mV."

        "abstract": "Globalization of Integrated Circuit (IC) design and manufacturing is making designers and users of ICs re-assess their trust in hardware. As the IC design flow spans the globe - driven by cost-conscious consumer electronics - hardware is increasingly prone to reverse engineering, Intellectual Property (IP) piracy and malicious modifications (i.e., hardware trojans). An attacker, anywhere within the global design flow, can reverse engineer the functionality of an IC/IP, steal and claim ownership of the IP or introduce counterfeits into the supply chain. Moreover, an untrusted IC fab may overbuild ICs and sell them illegally. Finally, rogue elements in the fabs may insert hardware trojans into the design without the knowledge of the designer or the end-user of the IC; this additional functionality may subsequently be exploited to introduce errors in the results, steal sensitive information or incapacitate a fielded system. The semiconductor industry routinely loses $billions annually due to these attacks. This talk will cover various forms of threats that the electronic chip supply chain is up against, as well as defenses against these threats. The talk will elucidate the development of CAD algorithms/tools for this newly emerging field by mostly leveraging principles from other more mature research domains."

The algorithm integrates dynamic state estimation (DSE) with an extended linear quadratic regulator (ELQR) for optimal control. The control for one generation unit only requires measurements and parameters for that unit, and hence the control at a unit remains completely independent of other units. The control gains are updated in real-time, therefore the control scheme remains valid for any operating condition. The applicability of the proposed algorithm has been demonstrated on a representative power system model."

This growth drives the need of very large capacity processors to store, switch and route vast amount of data. With the electronics industry embracing the \"More-than-Moore\" concept to increase the integration level of the data processors, future generations of CMOS technology must not only scale transistor dimensions, but also need to embrace various heterogeneous integration technologies with new processing architectures. The emerging silicon photonics technology, which is compatible with the main stream CMOS manufacturing processes, promises significant enhancement in processing speed and capacity. In this talk, we will review the current status of the silicon photonics technology and new capability it would enable."

Sequence component based relaying principles are therefore being affected. In this paper, fundamental and modulating frequency components are incorporated in phasor estimation formulation to improve the accuracy. The method estimates the two frequencies first and then the phasor using least squares technique. As an application of the proposed method, the sequence component of current is used for detection of unbalanced fault during power swing. The method is tested for numerous power swing and fault conditions of a WSCC 9-bus system and compared with conventional methods."

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. The remediation of NOx emission from diesel exhaust or gas turbines has been widely studied for atmospheric pollution and human health. In order to reduce exhaust gases, non-thermal atmospheric plasmas, Selective Catalytic Reduction(SCR), and SCR with plasma technology have been use. SCR with plasma technology has the highest efficiency to remove NOx emission. However, because of the high maintenance cost and frequent replacement of catalysts, plasma technology not in combination with a catalyst has been interesting. We investigate the efficiency of NOx reduction by dual pulsed atmospheric air plasma sources. NOx concentration is controlled by the variation of high frequency and low frequency of dual pulsed plasma. In Global simulation, a detailed reaction mechanism about NO, NO2, N2O remediation is proposed with single pulse and dual pulses. Main reactions are use d to develop 1-D fluid and hybrid simulation. In these simulations, spatial distribution of radicals and electron densities is investigated. Major pathway of NOx concentration is presented in different spatial position. In this research, simulation results show that dual pulsed plasma can reduce NOx emission more than single pulsed plasma. It can be a new solution for NOx reduction."

We adopt the Bayesian and information-theoretic paradigms so that we have at our disposal probabilistically consistent means for incorporation of the observations in the implemented estimation and for effective combination of the gained ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù by the nodes in the network. The presented theory will be demonstrated by examples. They include linear regression, Kalman filtering, logistic regression, and inference of an inhomogeneous Poisson process."

Application of neural networks allows to determine the non-linear regularities in noisy heterogeneous data, provides valid calculations results in a large number of input parameters. At presence of input data for network training the created neural network helps simply enough to find the power consumption of an asynchronous motor at electric network voltage deviations from the nominal value in a wide range of voltages, load factor changes, and also if it is necessary of other data initial."

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) on interval data.

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. The energy gain of an electron beam in the laser-driven plasma wave can be limited by dephasing between the accelerated electron bunch and the plasma wave. The dephasing length is defined as the length the electrons travel before it phase slip by one-half period of plasma wave. Since the velocity of the accelerated electrons is higher than the phase velocity of plasma wave, the electrons outrun the plasma wave and moves into decelerating region of the plasma wave phase space. In order to enlarge the dephasing length, the plasma wavelength should be increased by optimizing the plasma density profile. We report the measurements of dephasing length using plasma density distribution with linear, up-ramp and parabolic profile. The accelerated electron energy gain is calculated in different plasma density profiles. We observe that the plasma wavelength decreases when the plasma wave propagates from low to high-density layer. After density transition, the accelerated electron phase synchronizes with the phase of plasma wave. This increases the electron acceleration length and improves the beam quality. This may be crucial to determine the electron beam energy in LWFA."
