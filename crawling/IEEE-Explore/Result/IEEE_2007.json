In this talk I will introduce several classes of probabilistic Fountain codes, including LT-and Raptor codes, show tools for their design and analysis, and discuss how they are used today to solve various data transmission problems on heterogenous unreliable networks. I will also talk about the theory of these codes when transmission takes place over non-erasure channels, and low-complexity algorithms are used for their decoding."

The potential is evaluated using a standard model predictive control formulation and illustrated on a simulation example. The results shows that the significant potential savings depends on two refrigeration system parameters and the variation of the outdoor temperature. The system dependency is illustrated in a parameter study."

In other words, a BCI allows users to act on their environment by using only brain activity, without using peripheral nerves and muscles. The major goal of BCI research is to develop systems that allow disabled users to communicate with other persons, to control artificial limbs, or to control their environment. To achieve this goal, many aspects of BCI systems are currently being investigated. Research areas include evaluation of invasive and noninvasive technologies to measure brain activity, evaluation of control signals (i.e. patterns of brain activity that can be used for communication), development of algorithms for translation of brain signals into computer commands, and the development of new BCI applications. In this paper we give an overview of the aspects of BCI research mentioned above and highlight recent developments and open problems."

This paper analyzes in detail analysis the unambiguous spectrum reconstruction of the nonuniform sampling SAR signals and multi-channel SAR imaging; Based on the difference and correlation between the multi-channels signals and single channel signal, we resolve the multi-channels SAR imaging, the simulate results prove that the theoretic analysis is correct."

Compared to Si devices, the mobility limited by NA is enhanced in strained Si whereas the mobility limited by Nit is degraded. These new findings are explained through valleys population and scattering rate considerations. It is also found that the interface state generation in strained Si is smaller than in Si. This fact is beneficial to the device performance as well as the MOS device reliability."

Finally, the three coordinates of every new vertex are re-positioned by solving the Poisson equation based on the desirable normals and the boundary vertices of the hole. Many experimental results and error evaluations are given to show the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm."

To enable software developers to work more effectively, software engineering researchers often deliver tools, which produce even more information. The effect of more and more tools producing more and more information is placing developers into overload. It would be reasonable to here a software developer utter, \"Houston: We are in overload\"!

Three machine types are tested under various load conditions using the proposed technique. The first machine type are a three-phase 2.24 kW and a 3.73 kW induction motors. The second is a 4.5 kW synchronous generator. The last is a 5 kW dc machine which is operated as both motor and generator. The results show that the machine power losses calculated from the proposed technique has an error less than 4 % comparing with power losses from the experiment. Therefore, the technique can be acceptable for the estimation of power losses in electrical machine. The main advantage of this method is that the machines need not to stop or to be removed from their operation process in order to measure their losses."

Global trends - such as the vastly increasing number of megacities, the increase of the average life expectancy and the growth in world population - are changing the requirements of future production plants using discrete and process technology. In this context, one important aspect will be the continued optimizing of operational resources and raw materials to ensure the supply of acceptable resources for mankind. But the growing dynamism of the markets and ever shorter product lifecycles, too, are part of the core requirements of the Production of the Future. To implement these requirements, there are interesting approaches such as the Digital Factory, Autonomous Components or Plug&Play."

But keeping the smoothness between the adjacent patches is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a method for stitching several surface patches, which is a key step in complicated surface modeling, with polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes (PHT-spline for short). The method is simple and can be easily applied to complex surface modeling. With the method, spline surfaces can be constructed efficiently and adoptively to fit genus-zero meshes after their spherical parameterization is obtained, where only small sized linear systems of equations are involved."

A result of tins integration role is that progress in each area is both enabling and demanding significant change in the way we assemble and package semiconductors to deliver solutions to a consumer driven market place. The most significant change is the rapid growth in 3D integration and system in package (SiP) technology. The enabling technologies include wafer thinning, wafer to wafer and die to wafer bonding, through silicon vias and many more. The projections for progress in these areas to be included in the 2007 version of the ITRS will be presented."

Most of these algorithms are static and some work remains to be done to handle deforming surfaces. In such case, we defend the idea that each point of the sampling should move with the surface using the information given by the motion to allow fast reconstruction. In this article, we tackle the problem of producing a good evolving sampling of a deforming surface S, and maintaining its DT along the motion. The surface is known only through a projection operator (O1): i3 → S , and a normal operator (O2) that returns the oriented normal at a point on the surface. On that basis, we offer some perspectives on how reconstruction algorithms can be extended to the tracking of deforming surfaces."

The proposed tuning has a wide servo band range in the frequency domain. The Hurwitz stability criterion was used to obtain the simple robust stability conditions (SRS) for given parameters and one changeable parameter. In addition, a sequential ISE search method for grid points was used for the auto tuner. Moreover, two versions of a new interpolation method from a 3*3 small grid to a 5*5 grid are proposed."

In order to validate the fidelity of proposed zero effort miss, several methods of determination of the zero effort miss are compared with proposed method by simulation. Simulation results show that zero effort miss formulation better than other methods and has obvious advantages of the application."

In applications such as cellular phones, it is crucial to achieve high conversion efficiency over the entire load range. A binary-weighted segmented power stage is used to dynamically optimize the converter efficiency by reducing the gate-drive losses at mid-to-light loads. An all-digital segment controller based on a load current estimator is demonstrated. This approach is most effective in the mid-load range, where the losses are reduced by 33%, corresponding to an efficiency improvement of 7.5 % at Vin= 4.2 V. A peak efficiency of 89 % is achieved at fs = 4 MHz and Vin = 2.7 V."

This parameterization consists of minimizing discrete harmonic energy subject to spherical constraints and solving the constrained optimization by the Lagrange-Newton method. We also present several examples which show that parametric surfaces of PHT-splines can be constructed adoptively and efficiently to fit given meshes associated with our parameterization results."

A DOE is a road map for data generation and analysis that is methodical, efficient, and meaningful. This presentation highlights two manufacturing simulation case studies with emphasis on the process for creating and assessing the DOEs. DOE evolution is discussed, as well as the difference between a DOE and a DOE model. Tips and tricks for setup, visualization, and graphing are also highlighted."

        "abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate the manipulation of single and multiple micro-particles using a bulk acoustic wave (BAW) piezoelectric actuator. Particle motion is achieved by a combination of inertial and acoustic forces, exerted by a piezoelectric actuator, onto particles placed on its surface. This manipulation technique is capable of controlled manipulation of single and multiple micro-particles. The particles can be moved as far as ten times their diameters. The forces generated by the actuator are characterized using a finite element method (FEM) simulation and a theoretical study of the interfacial forces. A comparative study of the forces generated by the actuator and the particle-surface interfacial forces measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) is then performed to show the feasibility of this technique. Experimental and theoretical results show good agreement indicating that this technique can prove to be a versatile tool for the controlled non-destructive manipulation of single as well as multiple micro-particles in the fields of biosensors, tissue engineering, bio-chips, microfabrication and MEMS devices."

Then we'll talk about the learning design process, and show how these elements can be developed during a systematic design process that yields deeply contextualized challenging practice. In short, why learning can be 'hard fun'. The result is an optimal balance that promises more meaningful learning and more engaging experiences!"

Furthermore, examples of adaptive subdivision illustrate the practicability of the error estimation approach."

VCC is build to verify the functional correctness of Microsoft's hypervisor code base. The first step in developing VCC so far has been the efficient encoding of a faithful memory model. The next step is the development of a programming methodology which allows for automatic verification of annotated low level concurrent code. In this talk, I will report on the design of VCC, and on first experiments in applying it."

Most people get only glimpses of what we do, and those glimpses rarely tell the story clearly. Think about the view of InfoVis that has been created in 2007 through marketing, blogs, and articles. This view is peppered with misperception. In this presentation, I'll take you on a tour of InfoVis' exposure in 2007: the highlights and the failures that have shaped the world's perception of our beloved and important work. The world needs what we do, but this need remains largely unsatisfied."

Service oriented architecture is a paradigm for organizing and utilizing distributed capabilities that may be under the control of different ownership domains. It provides a uniform means to offer, discover, interact with and use capabilities to produce desired effects consistent with measurable preconditions and expectations. By following service oriented architecture, a computer system or software is componentized as a service. One of the most important points of service oriented architecture is interoperability; the services should be accessed from other services easily. Service oriented architecture is still an emerging approach. There have not been so many concrete implementations yet. More researches and practices are required in this area."

Wireless communications, traditional telephony, the Internet, broadcast communication networks; to name a few, are elements of the networking fabric that weaves together our work, entertainment, health, education, finances, and security. As networking research has torn down the barriers between layers of the classic communication and information system architecture, information theory, signal processing and communication theory have come to directly impact applications and services. National Science Foundation (NSF) supports this view with several new research programs such as clean-slate Internet, cybertrust and sensor networking, while evolving the long standing programs in signal processing and communications. True to NSF tradition of leading and following the research community, this keynote talk aims to simultaneously present the stage, and receive direction."

Visual tasks simulated in this program were using Thai characters. Defects were si and n of Thai characters and also the background characters were a, a, n, i, a, i, and u. The density of background was filled about 30% of all areas of each screen. Nine subjects were randomly chosen and passed efficiency test of eyes to perform visual task. Training steps were divided in three levels to provide basic information, percent of defects, and location of defects, respectively. The results revealed that inspector performances were improved on mean search times significantly difference at the level of 0.01 and accuracy of defect detected significantly difference at the level of 0.05. This could be concluded that feedforward training affected inspector performance."

Today RF-CMOS is the mainstream, high volume production technology for single-chip radios in cellphones and wireless LANs. It is proving to be more than a cheap replacement for BiCMOS: the intimate merging of RF, analog and digital, and some unique features of CMOS such as analog discrete-time signal processing is giving rise to entirely new paradigms such as software-defined radio. This talk will give an overview of the development of RF-CMOS from its beginnings to date, and a glance on the possibilities ahead."
