        "abstract": "Gait benchmarks empower the research community to train and evaluate high-performance gait recognition systems. Even though growing efforts have been devoted to cross-view recognition, academia is restricted by current existing databases captured in the controlled environment. In this paper, we contribute a new benchmark for Gait REcognition in the Wild (GREW). The GREW dataset is constructed from natural videos, which contains hundreds of cameras and thousands of hours streams in open systems. With tremendous manual annotations, the GREW consists of 26K identities and 128K sequences with rich attributes for unconstrained gait recognition. Moreover, we add a distractor set of over 233K sequences, making it more suitable for real-world applications. Compared with prevailing predefined cross-view datasets, the GREW has diverse and practical view variations, as well as more natural challenging factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset for gait recognition in the wild. Equipped with this benchmark, we dissect the unconstrained gait recognition problem. Representative appearance-based and model-based methods are explored, and comprehensive baselines are established. Experimental results show (1) The proposed GREW benchmark is necessary for training and evaluating gait recognizer in the wild. (2) For state-of-the-art gait recognition approaches, there is a lot of room for improvement. (3) The GREW benchmark can be used as effective pre-training for controlled gait recognition.

Several points of view are given about what new MDE approaches specific to this field should include in order to eliminate the identified deficiencies. Moreover, it is indicated that new MDE approaches should be designed including round-trip engineering to provide high mobility, use of special standards, in-vehicle communication networks and support for different system-on-chips in these public transportation systems."

High-performance workloads demand heterogeneous processing, tiered memory architecture, persistent memory support, infrastructure accelerators such as smart NICs, and infrastructure processing units to meet the demands of the emerging compute landscape. Applications such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Analytics, 5G, automotive, and high-performance computing are driving significant change in infrastructure such as Cloud, Edge, and client computing. Interconnect is a key pillar in this evolving computational landscape. The recent advent of Compute Express Link (CXL), a new open standard for cache-coherent interconnect, with its memory and coherency semantics has made it possible to pool computational and memory resources at the rack level using low-latency, higher-throughput, and memorycoherent access mechanisms. CXL is adopting networking features such as multi-host connectivity, pooled memory, persistence flows, and fabric manager while keeping its low-latency load-store semantics intact. The load-store I/O interconnects such as PCI Express (PCIe) and CXL are evolving to provide efficient access mechanisms across multiple nodes with advanced atomics, acceleration, smart NICs, persistent memory support etc. In this talk we will explore how synergistic evolution across load-store interconnects and fabrics can benefit the compute infrastructure of the future."

Internet of Things (IoT) aims to enable a world where physical objects, integrated into information networks, provide smart services for human beings. The introduction of edge computing in IoT can reduce the decision-making latency, save bandwidth resources, and extend the cloud services to be distributed at the edge of the network. However, edge-based IoT systems currently faces challenges in their decentralized trust management. Trust management plays an essential role for reliable data fusion and mining, provisioning of services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. In this talk, we analyze the edge-based IoT architectures that are available in the literature. Then, a comprehensive review of trust requirements in edge-enabled IoT systems is presented. We notably discuss about blockchain as a key enabler to address many trust related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and edge computing. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of trusted edge computing based IoT systems' performance and recommend promising research directions for future investigations. "

And to produce the vertical and lateral velocities, the small thrust variations of both side rotors and the lateral angle variation of thrust vector of right side rotor are used.

Human-centricity will drive a revolution in the design of Future Networks, which will augment the importance of communication networks as social infrastructure in order to respond and play a pivotal role in addressing key social challenges concerning work, education, inclusion, equality, and react to emergencies such as pandemics. Hyper-connectivity and human-centricity will enable persistent personalized access to digital services and resources, both virtual and physical, without constraints of time and location. To enact such research we will need to rely on an inter-disciplinary end-to-end design methodology, embedding technological and social practices into the design of future network infrastructure and services. In addition to societal considerations, I will also address the commercial drivers for evolving from today’s device-centric to future human-centric-networks. Finally, I will discuss the need for new technological breakthroughs to enable human-centricity in the Next Generation Internet and 6G infrastructures."

Firstly, the randomness of different wind power scenarios is updated by Weibull PDFs, and the ramp rate of traditional units is coupled. Furthermore, a new peak-load regulating compensation mechanism is proposed to guarantee flexibility cost. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the energy management strategy proposed in this article can effectively satisfy the flexibility requirements of the system and stimulate the incentive of traditional power to provide flexibility."

Future shipboard power systems rely on combination of high-energy and high-power density storage devices that need to share the load among other energy resources in a ship to ensure security and resilience of energy supply. In this paper, optimal energy management of droop-based MVDC shipboard power systems with multiple hybrid energy storage units is first formulated using nonlinear programming. Resistive and capacitive droop controllers are considered for energy units in the shipboard power system. To guarantee a global optimum exists, secondorder cone programming (SOCP) relaxation is used to convert the nonlinear formulation to its linear approximate. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed formulation in real-time and hour-ahead optimal flows."

As the number of these activities carried out grows, keeping track of their distinctive warning messages and other outputs becomes a serious task. In addition, software teams in a company that cannot find the opportunity to collaborate may be unaware of a new quality activity implemented by another team. This means that the potential within the software company cannot be efficiently utilized. Bimar Quality Portal (KAP) software has emerged to solve these problems that we observed in the field. In this experience paper, the needs that reveal the KAP software, how the KAP application meets these needs, and the achievements will be revealed."

During the past decades wireless communication has made an enormous growth. Triggered by a large R&D effort, the integration of transceivers in CMOS technology has made low-cost mass production possible. For many applications like Bluetooth, a single-chip CMOS transceiver can now do the job. On the other hand, for complex transceivers like in modern smartphones, still more discrete RF components such as filters, switches and diplexers are being added to protect the transceiver from strong interferers which are often produced by the device itself. To satisfy the future bandwidth hunger, the number of frequency bands will further increase, modulation schemes will become more complex, more antennas will be used and carrier aggregation will be the norm. To limit the number of discrete RF components, linearity of the transceivers is key. Since more computing power will be needed in future transceivers as well, newer CMOS technologies are also wanted. CMOS technology will scale in favor of fast-switching digital circuits, but not for classical analog functions, like amplifiers. For the next fifteen years re-thinking of basic circuits and systems will be needed to make highly integrated linear transceivers, in a technology that is designed for digital circuits."

Finally, I will introduce L#, a new and simple approach to active automata learning. Instead of focusing on equivalence of observations, like the L* algorithm and its descendants, L# takes a different perspective: it tries to establish apartness, a constructive form of inequality."

The genomics revolution in Africa began almost a decade ago to identify genetic and environmental determinants of human disease and wellness. This momentum is accelerating to advance science globally through large initiatives on the continent of Africa, for example, Human Hereditary and Health in Africa (H3Africa), Data Science Initiative for Africa (DSI-Africa), African Open Science Platform (AOSP), and the recent call by the Wellcome Trust (WT) for the setting up African Population Cohort Consortia (APCC) amongst others. All these efforts are aimed at transforming “data- poor Africa” into a data-rich Africa. We want to tackle multiple SDGs, centred on health and wellness and climate change, for effective policy implementation for maximum impact. To harness these opportunities, we will leverage cutting-edge technologies and innovative methods to deliver better tools for disease diagnosis and prognosis; and novel targeted treatmentand prevention that is suitable for LMICs settings. This talk highlights real-life examples and challenges for incorporating handheld or point of care ultrasound (POCUS) device data into routine healthcare and research participant surveillance, and the opportunities for application of deep learning/AI for aiding clinical decision making leveraging the emerging Mobile fog computing (MFC) approaches."

We believe data science and AI will change the world. No matter how smart and powerful an AI model we can build, the ultimate testimony of the success of data science and AI is users’ trust. How can we build trustworthy data science? At the level of user-model interaction, how can we convince users that a data analytic result is trustworthy? At the level of group-wise collaboration for data science and AI, how can we ensure that the parties and their contributions are recognized fairly, and establish trust between the outcome (e.g., a model built) of the group collaboration and the external users? At the level of data science participant eco-systems, how can we effectively and efficiently connect many participants of various roles and facilitate the connection among supplies and demands of data and models? In this talk, I will brainstorm possible directions to the above questions in the context of an endto-end data science pipeline. To strengthen trustworthy interactions between models and users, I will advocate exact and consistent interpretation of machine learning models. Our recent results show that exact and consistent interpretations are not just theoretically feasible, but also practical even for API-based AI services. To build trust in collaboration among multiple participants in coalition, I will review some progress in ensuring fairness in federated learning, including fair assessment of contributions and fairness enforcement in collaboration outcome. Last, to address the need of trustworthy data science eco-systems, I will review some latest efforts in building data and model marketplaces and preserving fairness and privacy. Through reflection I will discuss some challenges and opportunities in building trustworthy data science for possible future work."

        "abstract": "Safety concerns over radiofrequency (RF) exposures have been around for many decades. Recently 5G technology for wireless communication has cause a new concern over its safety. This technology provides much faster data transmission than 4G. The frequency spectrum of 5G is divided into millimeter waves, mid-band and low-band. For higher frequency transmission, the reach is short, so more cells are required, which are called small cells. Millimeter waves also have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited. A beam forming technology is used to facilitate communication. The concerns are over the more antennas installed in the vicinity and the fear of the unknown effects from higher frequency exposures. IEEE International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety (ICES) has recently published a revised standard C95.1-2019 “IEEE Standard for Safety Levels with Respect to Human Exposure to Electric, Magnetic, and Electromagnetic Fields, 0 Hz to 300 GHz”. In this new standard, exposure limits above 6 GHz are revised to include both limits inside the body (on the body surface due to the limited penetration depth) and outside the body (for easy measurement). Rationales of setting the limits will be discussed."

Given their nature, however, program flaws may lead to dramatic financial losses and can be hard to fix. This motivates the need for formal methods that can provide smart contract developers with correctness and security guarantees, ideally automating the verification task. This tutorial introduces the semantic foundations of smart contracts and reviews the state-of-the-art in the field, focusing in particular on the automated, sound, static analysis of Ethereum smart contracts. We will highlight the strengths and drawbacks of different methods, suggesting open challenges that can stimulate new research strands. Finally, we will overview eThor, an automated static analysis tool that we recently developed based on rigorous semantic foundations."

Personalized recommender systems are essential tools to facilitate human decision making. Many contemporary recommender systems use advanced machine learning techniques to model and predict user preferences from behavioral data. While such systems can provide helpful recommendations, their algorithms' design does not incorporate the underlying psychological mechanisms that shape user preferences and behavior. In this keynote, we will discuss recent work in psychology-informed recommender systems, i.e., recommender systems that consider extrinsic and intrinsic human factors in their algorithmic design. We show how such systems can improve the recommendation process in a user-centric fashion."

For one instance, it could just be used as a simple device to turn on and off our light switch, but it also may play an important role in devices that keeps people alive. More so now, when we are talking about digitalization, our every day-to-day information has now been digitized and feedback into a centralize big data storage either physically or in the cloud. Another buzz word that has now play an important role is Internet of things, IoT. There is an increase in diversity and complexity of IoT applications that creates a lot of challenges in System on a Chip designers. One of the aspects that becomes crucial will be implementing security at the design phases, building hardware that incorporates hardened security features to ensure that devices are protected throughout their lifecycle from chip manufacturing to day-to-day deployment, to decommissioning. This presentation shares some of practices and challenges that are been used to ensure security hardening primarily in the hardware."

In this talk, I will first present a characterization of state-of-the-art serverless platform and derive several key metrics, which collectly forms a systematic methodology and a benchmark called severlessbench. Then, I will show how severless platform can be optimized for (sub-)millisecond startup latency for both normal and condential severless computing. Finally, I will present an outlook on challenges and opportunities of serverless comptuting, including how to make it secure and efficient for joint cloud computing."

Enterprises are increasingly moving their production workloads to the cloud to take advantage of capabilities, such as streamlined provisioning of infrastructure and services, elasticity, scalability, reliability, and security. To leverage such capabilities, monolithic applications typically have to be decomposed to cloud-native architectures, such as microservices. A microservice encapsulates a small and well-defined set of business functionalities and interacts with other services using lightweight mechanisms, often implemented as RESTful APIs. A recent report shows that only 20% of the enterprise workloads are in the cloud, and they were predominately written for native cloud architectures. This leaves 80% of legacy applications onpremises, waiting to be refactored and modernized for the cloud. In this tutorial, we will discuss the motivation—supported by illustrative industrial case studies—for modernizing and migrating legacy applications to cloud. We will then present a detailed tool-supported approach for transforming a monolithic Java application into microservices. This will be followed by a handson virtual lab, where participants will have the opportunity to apply the learned concepts on a real-world enterprise application. Finally, we will conclude the tutorial with a discussion of promising directions for future research more broadly in the area of application modernization."

Advances in health behavior theories and the efficacy of health behavior interventions are limited by difficulties in invoking sustained health behavior changes within person across time. The Intensive Longitudinal Health Behavior Network (ILHBN) is a cooperative agreement network funded jointly by seven participating units within the National Institutes of Health to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, and ways to leverage intensive longitudinal data (ILD) collection and analytic methods to introduce innovations into long-standing behavioral theories and theory-driven behavior change interventions. The seven studies utilize a rich array of intensive longitudinal designs, data collection technologies (e.g., smartphones, wearables, video diaries), data types (e.g., ecological momentary assessments, location, accelerometry, physiological data, videos, images, and phone usage data), and analytic tools to study health behavior changes. This panel addresses several of the challenges in collecting and utilizing ILD."

Learning representations is critical for machine learning and very computation-intensive process. There are many opportunities to introduce efficiencies through parallel and distributed computing. The success of machine learning algorithms depends on data representation. Different representations can expose or hide different features of the data. As we think about the future of learning representations and its impact on machine learning it is important to consider the state of the art of machine learning today, the challenges and opportunities for addressing the computation issues around representation learning, and how to get to deeper understanding and more capabilities in machine learned models. In this talk I will describe 4 ideas related to computational issues in representation learning: reducing uncertainty, developing compact representations, debasing the training data, and developing privacy-preserving representations."

Parallelism and distribution are now fundamentally integrated aspects of nearly all areas of computation. Over the last eleven years, the CDER center has been working to raise awareness of the need to incorporate these concepts in computer science education, starting in the earliest courses, and to sponsor and train instructors in developing novel parallel and distributed computing (PDC) education approaches. CDER recently concluded a study that gathered input from PDC stakeholder communities to identify their needs. The results indicate that lack of early PDC education in undergraduate programs is actually just one sign of a broader failure of computer science education to adjust to the nature of the modern computing ecosystem. This talk will illustrate the problem, and identify directions for addressing it through adopting a more modern underlying model and changing the approach employed in teaching computational problem solving from the beginning."

Current infrastructure SoCs, such as Arm Neoverse based platforms, provide a large number of cores (e.g. 64-128 cores) integrated using one or more large mesh-based topologies (e.g. 8x8 meshes). Future SoCs are expected to grow even larger both in terms of number of cores and mesh size (10x10 and beyond). These large meshes, however, introduce longer memory access and core-core communication latency, as well as a tendency for congestion hotspots in heavy traffic scenarios. Meanwhile, advances in 3D integration technologies create a new design space to explore 3D interconnect solutions that allow us to address these problems. In this talk we will discuss new 3D NoC topologies for 3D stacked dies as well as flat 2D topologies with express links (XL). XLs (based on the concepts Ruche Networks can leverage the wiring capabilities on additional layers in a 3D SoC to create long-range physical channels between non-adjacent tiles in the same dimension in the mesh. XLs can increase the available bandwidth and provide latencies comparable to smaller mesh topologies."

Jakob Van Zyl made major contributions to the field of airborne and space borne remote sensing and left a major legacy through his work and publications, the researchers he mentored and the students he taught. His PhD thesis at Caltech focused on the theory and application of polarimetric radar system and the wave-surface interactions. This was followed by a 35 years carrier at JPL where he worked on a number of polarimetric and interferometric radar systems including the Shuttle imaging radar missions. In addition to his radar work he also made a number of contributions in other fields of remote sensing such as imaging of planets around neighboring stars and development of drones for Martian surface observations. Few years ago he cofounded a company, Hydrosat, to develop space borne infrared instruments to map subtle surface temperature changes to assess health of vegetation. The first flight of this instrument will be in 2021 on the Vanzyl-1 spacecraft. in addition to his remote sensing work, he also played a key role in the strategic planning and development of a number of JPL astronomy, planetary and Earth observation missions This talk will highlight Jakob contribution to the field of remote sensing and the legacy he left for future research and missions."

Automatically extracting analogies from text is a task that is not well explored for Arabic. Thus, in this paper we investigate the use of Zero-Shot Learning with word embeddings as an automatic approach for Arabic analogies extraction. We applied this approach on three corpora: King Saud University Corpus of Classical Arabic (KSUCCA), Gigaword, and Wikipedia embeddings. The best obtained precision result was 0.667 with Gigaword corpus. We further analyzed the extracted analogies relations manually to understand their types."

Enterprises are increasingly moving their production workloads to the cloud to take advantage of capabilities, such as streamlined provisioning of infrastructure and services, elasticity, scalability, reliability, and security. To leverage such capabilities, monolithic applications typically have to be decomposed to cloud-native architectures, such as microservices. A microservice encapsulates a small and well-defined set of business functionalities and interacts with other services using lightweight mechanisms, often implemented as RESTful APIs. A recent report shows that only 20% of the enterprise workloads are in the cloud, and they were predominately written for native cloud architectures. This leaves 80% of legacy applications onpremises, waiting to be refactored and modernized for the cloud. In this tutorial, we will discuss the motivation - supported by illustrative industrial case studies - for modernizing and migrating legacy applications to cloud. We will then present a detailed tool-supported approach for transforming a monolithic Java application into microservices. This will be followed by a handson virtual lab, where participants will have the opportunity to apply the learned concepts on a real-world enterprise application. Finally, we will conclude the tutorial with a discussion of promising directions for future research more broadly in the area of application modernization."

Personalized recommender systems are essential tools to facilitate human decision making. Many contemporary recommender systems use advanced machine learning techniques to model and predict user preferences from behavioral data. While such systems can provide helpful recommendations, their algorithms' design does not incorporate the underlying psychological mechanisms that shape user preferences and behavior. In this keynote, we will discuss recent work in psychology-informed recommender systems, i.e., recommender systems that consider extrinsic and intrinsic human factors in their algorithmic design. We show how such systems can improve the recommendation process in a user-centric fashion."

Air quality is a topic that arouses increasing interest, especially in the field of smart cities. In fact, most modern cities have, to a greater or lesser extent, air quality measurement stations. These systems are useful for measuring representative values but not for locating specific pollution problems. One solution to this problem is to measure in more places, but the high cost of these stations is a limiting factor. Thus, an alternative solution is to deploy a low-cost sensor network to monitor multiple points simultaneously. However, there are many challenges that must be solved when setting up a network of this type. In this presentation, the process of creating a network of this type from the beginning and how it has evolved from the initial concepts will be discussed."

The use of unlicensed optical bands for wireless communications has been heralded as an exciting development for future broadband access for indoor, underwater and space communication links. This talk presents a broad overview of the work of the Free-space Optical Communication Algorithms Laboratory (FOCAL) at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada in developing novel optical wireless systems. The main thrusts of the group will be highlighted by emphasizing several recent contributions. Developments in the signalling design for visible light communication (VLC) systems will be presented along with several prototype VLC communication systems. Several approaches to indoor positioning using illumination devices and simple smartphone-based receivers will be presented. Some perspectives on our work in algorithms and experiments in long range freespace optical and space-based laser communications will also be highlighted. Finally, a vision for optical wireless technologies will be presented along with our ongoing research directions."

We show in this talk how control-theoretic tools can be leveraged to perform a rigorous nonlinear dynamic stability analysis of classical AGC implemented on a reasonably generic nonlinear power system. The analysis combines several technical tools, including singular perturbation theory, composite Lyapunov functions, and novel results on diagonal stability of matrices with a rank-1 structure. We conclude by commenting on the implications of the analysis for quantitatively assessing the dynamic performance of AGC."

A central goal of artificial intelligence is to design algorithms that are both generalisable and interpretable. We combine brain-inspired neural computation principles and scalable deep learning architectures to design compact neural controllers for task-specific compartments of a full-stack autonomous vehicle control system. We show that a single algorithm with 19 control neurons, connecting 32 encapsulated input features to outputs by 253 synapses, learns to map high-dimensional inputs into steering commands. This system shows superior generalisability, interpretability and robustness compared with orders-of-magnitude larger black-box learning systems. The obtained neural agents enable high-fidelity autonomy for task-specific parts of a complex autonomous system."

To address these problems, we propose a radically new OS design based on data-centric architecture: all operating system state should be represented uniformly as database tables, and operations on this state should be made via queries from otherwise stateless tasks. This design makes it easy to scale and evolve the OS without whole-system refactoring, inspect and debug system state, upgrade components without downtime, manage decisions using machine learning, and implement sophisticated security features. We discuss how a database OS (DBOS) can improve the programmability and performance of many of today’s most important applications, propose a plan for the development of a DBOS proof of concept, and give results on a pilot that suggest the approach has merit."

Although code coverage metrics such as line and branch are provided by the Integrated Development Environments (IDE), there is not any tool that can calculate the coverages of Graphical User Interface (GUI) components. In this study, we are suggesting a coverage measurement method that is independent of the source code and can function just by using application's compiled artifact (APK), for activity, action and GUI components. With the tool we have developed based on this method, it is possible to run functional tests and to identify all the accessed activities, executed actions, defined for an activity, and GUI components, which were referenced with their ID's, to obtain related coverages. We have confirmed the validity of our coverage metrics by running the tool for the tests we have written for a large scale mobile banking application."

As smart computing, exemplified by a combination of mobile based sensing and artificial intelligence (AI), begins to impact various aspects of our lives, there is a need to combine it with a better understanding of drivers of human behavior. We describe our ongoing work in diverse areas, including health, agriculture and information access where human-centric smart computing is key to developing an effective solution. We present an AI-based approach to modeling the diligence of health workers in a public health scenario, which is needed to ensure that the data being fed to downstream algorithms is of high quality. We describe additional scenarios of “data corruption” in the context of information access where the \"corruption\" of data is not a bug, but a feature based on natural human behavior. We then present a wellness-based approach to improve health outcomes for people, which requires a combination of mobile sensing, machine learning and influencing human behavior. Finally, we describe a deep learning based modeling of human behavior in a specific game-based setting, which has very interesting implications if we are able to generalize that approach to broader settings."

        "abstract": "Control strategies for grid-connected power converters can be broadly categorized into (i) grid-forming strategies that form a stable AC voltage (i.e., magnitude and frequency) at the converter terminal but assume that the DC voltage is stabilized by a fully controllable power source, and (ii) grid-following controls that form a stable DC voltage but assume that the AC voltage is stabilized by other devices in the grid. Consequently, grid-following is often fragile and frequently fails when the power system is under stress. In contrast, grid-forming power converters are commonly seen as a robust solution that is envisioned to replace synchronous machines as the cornerstone of future power systems. However, requiring a stable DC voltage is a significant obstacle in several application scenarios such as highvoltage DC transmission, low-frequency AC networks with converter-based frequency conversion, flywheel energy storage systems, and grid-connected renewable generation with limited flexibility. Instead, we propose control strategies that simultaneously form the converter's DC side and AC side voltage while ensuring power balance between the two sides and discuss theoretical results and applications in power systems consisting of interconnected AC and DC grids and grid-connected renewable generation."

Other than CPU, many autonomous co-processors, accelerators, device drives, and special circuits have been developed to address domain specific tasks. In recent years, DSPs (Digital Signal Processors), GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), APUs (Accelerated Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Array) and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) have demonstrated their effectiveness in domain specific processing. Both data and computations are arranged to achieve Near Resource Computing for efficient and accelerated application execution.

The Middle East is considered as an arid to semi-arid area where the average annual rainfall does not exceed 155mm/year. Iraq is located in the northeastern part of the Middle East. The water of Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and their tributaries are the main water resource for Iraq. The long-term average of flow of the Tigris was about 22.2 BCM and 24.78BCM from its tributaries while it is 30 BCM from the Euphrates River. The flow started to decrease from all these rivers due to climate change and the constriction of hydrological projects in riparian countries. It is believed that rainfall and the flow of these rivers will continue to decrease in future. To overcome this problem Iraq should take fast steps on regional and national levels. Iraq should reach a serious agreement with riparian countries about its share of water from these rivers. On national level, new long-term strategy is required that should take care of: Rehabilitating of dams, barrages & pump stations, Improving the efficiency of diversion and supply, Using of Nonconventional Water Resources, Irrigation modernization using suitable techniques, developing a Public awareness program and establishing an agenda for training."

Medicine 4.0 is a great revolution in inpatient care. New horizons are possible today. Covid 19 has highlighted problems that have existed for a long time. Relocation of services means remote monitoring, remote diagnoses without direct contact between the doctor and the patient. Hospitals are freed from routine tests performed by patients at home and reported by doctors on the internet. As a result, potentially dangerous conditions can be prevented. During the Covid emergency, everybody can check his condition and ask for a medical visit (swab) only when really necessary. It is true telemedicine and is not WhatsApp where an elder tries to chat with a doctor. It is a smart device able to measure objective vital parameters and send them to a health care center. Of course, Medicine 4.0 requires new technologies for smart sensors. These devices need to be very easy to use, fast, reliable, and low cost. Both people and doctors must accept them. Medicine 4.0 can use AI both to perform parameter measurements and to manage the monitoring of multiple patients."

Software systems must satisfy rapidly increasing demands imposed by emerging applications. For example, new AI applications, such as autonomous driving, require quick responses to an environment that is changing continuously. At the same time, software systems must be fault-tolerant in order to ensure a high degree of availability. As it stands, however, developing these new distributed software systems is extremely challenging even for expert software engineers due to the interplay of concurrency, asynchronicity, and failure of components. The objective of our research is to develop reusable solutions to the above challenges by means of novel programming models and frameworks that can be used to build a wide range of applications. This talk reports on our work on the design, implementation, and foundations of programming models and languages that enable the robust construction of large-scale concurrent and distributed software systems."

Because of their convenient frequencies and wavelengths, they have been considered for computational applications by encoding information into their phase and amplitude. Furthermore, the energy and spatial distribution of magnons can be readily manipulated via applied magnetic fields, which provides an easy pathway for controllable interactions. Concurrently, magnons readily interact with a wide variety of different excitations, including microwave and optical photons, phonons, and other magnons. Such hybrid magnon dynamic excitations have gained increased interest due to their potential impact on coherent information processing. This in turn may also open up new pathways for hybrid quantum information systems."

Emergency response to incidents such as accidents, crimes, and wildfires is a major problem faced by communities. Emergency response management (ERM) comprises several stages and sub-problems like forecasting, detection, allocation, and dispatch. The design of principled approaches to tackle each problem is necessary to create efficient ERM pipelines. This talk will go through the design of principled decision-theoretic and data-driven approaches to tackle emergency incidents. It will discuss the data collection, cleansing, and aggregation as well as some models and methods we used to solve an imbalanced classification problem. Further, we will explain how large multi-agent systems can be used to tackle emergency scenarios under dynamic environments and communication and state uncertainty. We will go through fundamental modeling paradigms like Markov decision processes, semi-Markov decision processes, and partially-observable Markov decision processes and how promising actions can be found for stochastic control problems. As case studies, we will specifically look at emergency incidents like wildfires and road accidents. We will also go through two open-source datasets that we have created for the research community to use regarding traffic accidents and wildfires."

Future AR glasses will be much like today’s smartphones, as our everyday information access and productivity devices. Technical challenges in optics, power, and tracking remain, but are solvable. However, technical achievements alone are insufficient to ensure that everyday AR systems will be productive, usable, useful, and satisfying. We must also design effective methods for interacting with and managing AR content, and we must understand the effects of always-on AR, on both individuals and communities. In this talk, I will present a vision of future everyday AR use cases, and discuss recent user experience (UX) research aimed at enabling this vision. I will discuss UX design recommendations for making information access through AR more convenient and usable than today's smartphones and smartwatches, while at the same time not distracting users from what's going on in the real world around them. I will conclude with a call to action for researchers and designers to carefully consider how everyday AR can benefit society and how to avoid potential pitfalls. "

Simulation of such operations is a key element in space robotic applications and also sim-to-real transfer in reinforcement learning. Complex unilateral contact interfaces, friction, diversity of material properties are among the many contributors that make such robotic tasks extremely difficult to realistically reproduce in simulation and in virtual environments in general. In this presentation, we describe and demonstrate simulation methods for such complex robotic systems and tasks in the context of space robotic operations. The techniques rely on the concept of system decomposition and real-time interfacing using co-simulation. We will introduce the concept of model-based coupling that can significantly enhance the performance and accuracy of real-time simulation. Challenging space robotic contact tasks, such as grasping and insertion with jamming, will be used to illustrate the methods and their performance."

Ultrasound reporting plays an important role in diagnosis as images produced during an ultrasound examination do not give the whole view of the medical conditions. However, in practice there are many issues that are inherent to ultrasound reporting and the most important was identified to be the lack of standardisation when producing these reports. There is a resistance to change from some radiologists preferring the free writing style, making any attempt to computerise the processing of these reports difficult. This research explores the possibility of using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) together with a domain ontology to transform free-form ultrasound reports into a structured form. It discusses a new approach in segmenting and identifying rhetorical relations that are more applicable to ultrasound reports from classical RST relations. The approach was evaluated on a sample ultrasound reports where the system's parsing was compared to the manual parsing performed by experts. The results show that discourse parsing using RST in ultrasound reports can be performed effectively using the support of a domain ontology. The results also demonstrate that the transformation of free-form ultrasound reports into a structured form can be performed with the support of RST relations identified and the domain ontology."
