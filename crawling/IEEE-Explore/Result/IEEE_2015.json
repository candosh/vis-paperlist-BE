        "abstract": "Lighting variation and uneven feature distribution are main challenges for indoor RGB-D visual odometry where color information is often combined with depth information. To meet the challenges, we fuse point and line features to form a robust odometry algorithm. Line features are abundant indoors and less sensitive to lighting change than points. We extract 3D points and lines from RGB-D data, analyze their measurement uncertainties, and compute camera motion using maximum likelihood estimation. We prove that fusing points and lines produces smaller motion estimate uncertainty than using either feature type alone. In experiments we compare our method with state-of-the-art methods including a keypoint-based approach and a dense visual odometry algorithm. Our method outperforms the counterparts under both constant and varying lighting conditions. Specifically, our method achieves an average translational error that is 34.9% smaller than the counterparts, when tested using public datasets."

In this paper, we present a joint design which optimally deploys network functions and allocates physical resources satisfying end-to-end requests with generated routes. We first discuss the problem behind such design and show its NP-completeness. We then propose a mixed-integer program which simultaneously identifies physical nodes to be deployed with network functions and generates routes sharing common physical resources realizing end-to-end requests. Computational results demonstrate the value of the integrated approach and its ability to allocate network functions supporting end-to-end requests with limited physical resources."

We use this analysis both to date buildings, as well as to discover how functionally-similar architectural elements (e.g. windows, doors, balconies, etc.) have changed over time due to evolving styles. We validate the methods by combining a large dataset of nearly 150,000 Google Street View images from Paris with a cadastre map to infer approximate construction date for each facade. Not only could our analysis be used for dating or geo- localizing buildings based on architectural features, but it also could give architects and historians new tools for confirming known theories or even discovering new ones."

This paper presents the experimental results of applying one-class SVM (OCSVM) on a number of real-world industrial traffic traces from very different industrial control systems (ICS). Initially focusing on a few network packet attributes, the results are discussed in terms of f-score, precision, and recall for different mappings of the features. The results demonstrate the high potential of using one-class SVM for monitoring packets and packet sequences in these networks."

In this paper, an automatic seeded region growing (SRG) algorithm for coloured images proposed by Y. Shih and S. Cheng is modified for segmentation of plant leaf diseases. The colour difference between adjacent regions is computed using Euclidean distance metric in the algorithm. This paper proposes a novel two dimensional look up table for labeling the neighbours for region merging. The look up table is created by traversing the image vertically and horizontally and any change in the labels of pixel is noted in the table. The incorporation of the table helps in better organization in region merging step and helps in further segmentation of the image. It must be noted that the performance of coloured image segmentation largely depends on the colour space chosen. The algorithm is first implemented in the YCbCr colour space and then implemented in other colour spaces like YCgCr, CIELAB and RGB to check for the best performance of the segmentation algorithm. Experimental results show that the SRG algorithm along with the proposed modification for region merging give good results in the YCbCr compared to other colour spaces for plant leaf disease segmentation."

However, writing an application for multiple accelerators remains today challenging because going from a single accelerator to multiple ones indeed requires to deal with potentially non-uniform domain decomposition, inter-accelerator data movements, and dynamic load balancing. Writing such code manually is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a new programming tool called STEPOCL along with a new domain specific language designed to simplify the development of an application for multiple accelerators. We evaluate both the performance and the usefulness of STEPOCL with three applications and show that: (i) the performance of an application written with STEPOCL scales linearly with the number of accelerators, (ii) the performance of an application written using STEPOCL competes with a handwritten version, (iii) larger workloads run on multiple devices that do not fit in the memory of a single device, (iv) thanks to STEPOCL, the number of lines of code required to write an application for multiple accelerators is roughly divided by ten."

Images have a large size which allows embedding secret messages of large size, so they are a good medium for digital steganography. The main goal of steganalysis is to detect the presence of hidden messages in digital media. In this paper, we propose a steganalysis method based on color feature correlation and machine learning classification. Fusing features with features obtained from color-rich models allows to increase the detect ability of hidden messages in the color images. Our novel proposition uses the correlation between different channels of color images. Features are extracted from the channel correlation and co-occurrence correlation. In this work, all stego images are created with a range of different payload sizes using two steganography S-UNIWARD and WOW algorithms. To validate the proposed method, his efficiency is demonstrated by comparison with color rich model steg analysis."

To support such simultaneous information and energy cooperation, we propose two transmission protocols, namely power splitting (PS) relaying protocol and the transmission mode adaptation (TMA) protocol for without/with the source-destination link, respectively. For both transmission protocols, joint resource allocation problems are formulated to maximize the system throughput. By using the Lagrange dual method, we develop efficient algorithms to find the optimal polices of the nonconvex optimization problems."

Next, we study how severity changes and quantify differences between classes in terms of bug-fixing attributes. Then, we focus on topic differences: using LDA, we extract topics associated with each severity class, and study how these topics differ across classes, platforms, and over time. Our findings include: severity and priority affect bug fixing time; medium-severity contributors are more experienced than high-severity contributors; and there have been more concurrency and cloud-related high-severity bugs on desktop since 2009, while on Android concurrency bugs are prevalent."

Noting the somewhat limited compute and battery life of today's devices, we present a computationally efficient approach to gesture recognition that can be effectively used inside an app running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware, such as an Android Smart watch. Our approach has two phases. The first phase is to construct finite state machines (FSM) for gesture recognition. We present a novel approach - which leverages techniques from functional programming languages - to define rich yet compact FSM. Such FSM can be further tuned for higher accuracy with help of some training data and a suitable optimization method - this is the second phase. To demonstrate effectiveness, we created a gesture recognition system for an automotive scenario as an Android Smart watch app and then tuned the gesture recognition engine using Cultural Algorithms optimization and training data. We achieved 77% gesture recognition accuracy which is on par which more computationally intensive techniques such as Hidden Markov Models."

The network assists the controller in stabilizing the closed-loop system and provides the means for connecting the sensors and actuators of the plant and the inputs and outputs of the controller. Further, the paper presents a framework for modelling the closed-loop system such that controller and network systems can be designed. The paper also provides an LMI-based algorithm for computing optimal controller and network systems that achieve a stable closed-loop system while meeting performance measures. The deigned systems have a fixed structure and hence the associated design complexity is reduced. Finally, the paper also illustrates with examples the effectiveness of the proposed design and computational procedures."

We propose to model each dataset by a compact Gaussian mixture which is designed for the specific purpose of colour transfer between images which have different scene content. A non rigid transformation is estimated by minimising the Euclidean distance (L2) between these two distributions and the estimated transformation is used for transfering colour statistics from one image to another. Experimental results show that this is a very promising approach for transferring colour and it performs very well against an alternative reference approach. "

It can be used in a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV)-battery powered pump system. With only a single transistor, the converter is able to efficiently perform three tasks simultaneously, namely, maximum power point tracking (MPPT), battery charging and driving the pump at constant flow rate. The conduction and switching losses of each individual components of the converter and the inductor core loss are calculated and analyzed when the two inductors operate in different modes. The analysis shows that the output stage inductor and power diode are the major contributors to the total power loss. A 14W laboratory prototype converter is built and the experimental results are compared with the model analysis."

        "abstract": "We consider a cognitive radio network, where primary users (PUs) share their spectrum with energy harvesting (EH) enabled secondary users (SUs), conditioned on a limited SUs' interference at PU receivers. Due to the lack of information exchange between SUs and PUs, the SU-PU interference channels are subject to uncertainty in channel estimation. Besides channel uncertainty, SUs' EH profile is also subject to spatial and temporal variations, which enforce an energy causality constraint on SUs' transmit power control and affect SUs' interference at PU receivers. Considering both the channel and EH uncertainties, we propose a robust design for SUs' power control to maximize SUs' throughput performance. Our robust design targets at the worst-case interference constraint to provide a robust protection for PUs, while guarantees a transmission probability to reflect SUs' minimum QoS requirements. To make the non-convex throughput maximization problem tractable, we develop a convex approximation for each robust constraint and successfully design a successive approximation approach that converges to the global optimum of the throughput objective. Simulations show that SUs will change transmission strategies according to PUs' sensitivity to interference, and we also exploit the impact of SUs' EH profile (e.g., mean, variance, and correlation) on SUs' power control."

In this article, we review two multimodal-based visual sentiment analysis models proposed in our group. Both model exploit the multimodal content from correlation and hyper graph view respectively. In the Multimodal Correlation Model (MCM), we observe the correlation among different modalities and model then through a probabilistic graphical model. In the Hyper graph Learning Model (HLM), we use hyper graph to model the independence of each modality. We further discuss the underneath challenges and foresee potential opportunities of this direction."

Inhomogeneous dielectrics can also be used to increase the gain and narrow the beam width of a horn antenna. Moreover, inhomogeneous dielectrics can be realized by a fast and economic manufacturing method, additive manufacturing (AM), which is also called 3D printing technology. It enables 3D fabrication of arbitrary shape and structure by printing layer by layer.

The design process of the proposed microwave lens for X-band sensing application is implemented in SIW technology. In this work, a new lens with SIW technology is proposed to feed an array antenna to generate multiple beams. Since multiple beams are possible to be simultaneously obtained by reusing the antenna aperture, frequency and multiple functions can be incorporated in a single electronic system. The simulated results around the frequency of 10-GHz demonstrate. The proffered lens, which is comprised of seven beam ports, nine array ports and eight dummy ports, was designed to operate at the center frequency of 10-GHz, on an RO5880 substrate with electric permittivity of 2.2 and thickness of 0.508mm. The proposed Rotman lens is designed for a nine linear array radiation elements. Seven beam ports were implemented in the proposed lens to generate seven beams at 0¬∞, ¬±8¬∞, ¬±16¬∞ and ¬±24¬±, respectively."

To perform dynamic reuse, it must be feasible for all links to maintain a certain signal quality despite the presence of interference. This can be ensured using reuse feasibility tests. However, state of the art testing algorithms show erroneous behavior when infeasibility occurs due to limited transmission powers. In this paper we develop two testing algorithms, based on nonnegative matrix theory, that explicitly take limited transmission powers into account and show how these can be implemented in protocols. The protocols are compared with the state of the art in terms of control channel usage, speed and accuracy of decision making. We find that the proposed protocols estimate reuse feasibility more accurately than the state of the art and are comparable in terms of speed and control channel usage."

Since the mechanical resonant frequency of the system will change with time and environment, the parameters of notch filter must be adjusted online with the resonant frequency. In this paper, according to the application requirements of mechanical resonance online suppressing, the mechanical resonance online suppressing algorithm based on adaptive IIR notch filter is proposed. Using a recursive least squares algorithm, resonant frequency of the system is online estimated, and then the frequency parameters of notch filter are adjusted online.

In this work, pavement and base layers local thickness estimation based on computer vision methods is proposed. The pavement and base layers thickness estimation are part of geotechnical studies, providing structural properties of flexible pavements.

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the circuit which is to reduce the number of switching elements in comparison to a common multi-level inverter NPC inverter. Increasing the number of levels of the output voltage at reduced circuit number switching elements, and performs waveform improvement. Typically, the ratio of the input voltage of the multi-level inverter is E1 : E2 = 1 : 1. When the ratio of the input voltage is 1 : 1, the number of the levels of the output voltage becomes only five-levels. Therefore, it increases the number of levels of the output voltage to a level seven by setting the ratio of the input voltage is E1 : E2=1 : 2. It is subjected to waveform improvement by increasing the number of levels of output voltage. Reducing the number of switching elements is advantageous for downsizing of the cost of the surface and the circuit. The simulated and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of seven-level operation in 6-switches inverter. Furthermore, this paper confirms same loss characteristics of the proposed multi-level inverter compare to the conventional NPC inverter."

Then a PI controller based on the state feedback of passive outputs is proposed. Simulation validation was performed using real data representing common driving situations.

The RN possesses a buffer and it is able to store the decoded message before retransmitting the message to the DNs. We use the joint link-and-user scheduling method to maximize the long term average achievable rate of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying system. The optimal scheduling criteria is obtained and a two-step approach is proposed to implement it. In addition, we propose a rate allocation scheme of the source-relay (S-R) link to preserve the flow conservation constraint of each individual user. Furthermore, two reduced complexity joint link-and-user scheduling methods which use the zero forcing (ZF) beamforming in the relay-destination (RD) link are investigated. It is shown that joint link-and-user scheduling can significantly increase the average achievable rate of the system."

The witness-functions are safe metrics used to compute security. An analysis with a witness-function consists in making sure that the security of every atomic message does not decrease during its lifecycle in the protocol. The analysis gets more difficult under nonempty equational theories. Indeed, the intruder can take advantage of the algebraic properties of the cryptographic primitives to derive secrets. These properties arise from the use of mathematical functions, such as multiplication, addition, exclusive-or or modular exponentiation in the cryptosystems and the protocols. Here, we show how to use the witness-functions under nonempty equational theories and we run an analysis on the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol under the cipher homomorphism. This analysis reveals that although this protocol is proved secure under the perfect encryption assumption, its security collapses under the homomorphic primitives. We show how the witness-functions help to illustrate an attack scenario on it and we propose an amended version to fix it."

The FSK-OCDMA system performance is compared with the existing pulse position modulation (PPM)-OCDMA system. The results reveal that the FSK-OCDMA system achieve better MAI cancellation by providing lower bit error rate than the PPM-OCDMA system."

Here, the firing rate dependence of ‚Äútruncation thresholds‚Äù, which are thresholds that are computed using a different approach, is investigated through simulation. Simulated data are constructed using extracellular recordings from cortical area M1 of awake behaving rats. The findings show that, unlike other thresholds, truncation thresholds decrease in absolute value with firing rate. In this way, the value of these thresholds adapts to weed out the noise depending on the firing rate. The results show that truncation thresholds are better than the alternatives considered here at determining the noise component in extracellular recordings."

This problem is important and has lots of applications because it can describe approximations of a wide variety of nonlinear systems. In this paper, the SARX identification problem is formulated as a kind of matrix rank minimization problem, and a practical algorithm is proposed based on the iterative partial matrix shrinkage (IPMS) algorithm. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm identifies SARX systems effectively."

Each follower node is modeled by a higher-order nonlinear systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics and an unknown disturbance. The leader node is also a higher-order nonlinear system. Only a part of the networked group has access to the information of the leader. And a distributed robust consensus controller is designed to ensure all the follower nodes synchronize to the trajectory of the leader node exponentially. Meanwhile, a smooth and time-varying sliding mode controller is presented to eliminate chattering phenomenon. The stability of the proposed methods is proved rigorously. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

A semi-supervised affinity propagation clustering algorithm based on kernel function (K-SAP Clustering Algorithm) is proposed in this paper. This algorithm first maps the complex clustering space into the feature space and change the similarity measure by a kernel function. Then semi-supervised algorithm is used to adjust the similarity matrix to be neighbours of data in same cluster. Finally, AP algorithm is used to iterate and undate to get the global optimum. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm is better and more accurate than SAP algorithm for complex data sets clustering."

Then, for the multiple observation requested generated from the multiple targets, a visual tracking algorithm for the PTZ camera is developed. The factors, such as the image resolution, vision coverage range and response to tracking requests, are taken into account in the algorithm, and the desired pose of the PTZ camera is worked out optimally. Finally, the vehicle tracking experiments both in a simulated airport and actual traffic scenes are carried out, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in this paper is accurate and time-efficient."

Based on the theory of product life cycle, the optimal advertising and pricing strategies are proposed for manufacturer and retailer in different stages of life cycle by using Stackelberg game method. The studies have shown that: In different stages, the optimal advertising strategies of the manufacturer and the retailer and the optimal recycle pricing strategies have large business with stage of life cycle. The enthusiasm of the retailer have positive correlation with the advertising subsidy of the manufacturer. To reach the win-win market model, the channel members should increase their advertisements' influence for product demand."

The used image processing approach helps in detecting the plasmodium vivax. Initially Platelets and smaller artefacts are removed from the microscopic image before the segmentation of Red Blood Corpuscles (RBC). After segmentation of RBCs the image is converted into HSV color space, for the detection of the parasite. The proposed work is to detect plasmodium vivax from leishman stained microscopic blood image and which promises to support pathologists for faster diagnosis."

Chaos genetic algorithm (CGA) can be solved in the process of water resources scheduling problem such as slow convergence speed, easy to fall into local optimization, but there are some limitations in the practical application. In this paper, by using multi-objective decision scheduling, real-time and regularity of rainfall will be combined with chaos genetic algorithm (GA), a more reasonable adjustment of water supply, water resources allocation optimization. The simulation results show that multi-objective decision-making based on chaos genetic algorithm can better satisfy user needs, stick to the waste water, improve the satisfaction degree of the water, more comprehensive benefits."

If some of the parameters exceed a certain range, the whole control system will appear unstable. On the basis of analyzing and simplifying the mathematical model of BLDCM, Predictive Functional Control (PFC) scheme is proposed to speed control for BLDCM. In order to validate the real-time of PFC algorithm, hardware circuits and software programs are designed by choosing TMS320F2812 DSP as the main control chip and C language as control software for PC. Experimental results show that speed waves controlled by PFC have faster response, small overshoot and small static tracking error, achieving better speed control effects."

        "abstract": "Complex electronic circuitry is seen in many devices, which results in a vast interference potential. To predict the electromagnetic interference, source reconstruction techniques that extract equivalent sources of current or dipole from scanned near-field (NF) data are developed. Some source reconstruction techniques need the knowledge of NF phase and they employ the least-square method to solve inverse problems (Z. Yu, et al., IEEE Trans. EMC, 1, 2013, 97‚Äì108). Due to the ill-posted nature of the problem, regularization techniques are often needed along with the least-square method to eliminate potential false solutions. However, accurate measurement of NF phase is usually difficult in practical applications, especially as the operating frequency is very high. Some other source reconstruction techniques which do not need the NF phase are also developed. They employ global optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm to solve inverse problems (X. Tong, et al., IEEE Trans. EMC, 2, 2010, 462‚Äì470). These techniques are generally associated with high computational complexity, and they need several hours to obtain the equivalent dipoles of a simple printed circuit board (PCB). An effective source reconstruction technique is proposed in this abstract for the prediction of radio-frequency interference (RFI). The proposed technique does not need to know the NF phase. Equivalent magnetic dipoles are used to model the radiated emission sources of devices, and they are determined by solving an inverse problem with a proposed restart differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Compared to previous methods, the present method has much lower computational complexity. It only needs around 10 minutes on normal desktop PC to extract the equivalent dipole sources of a PCB."

By analyzing characteristics of the intersection signalization from the angle of game theory, a game model with four players which represent fours traffic streams in the corresponding phase, is established. Specifically, the game problem for the proposed model is solved by using the Nash bargaining solution and Shapley valuation solution in the cooperative game theory. By applying these solutions, the green time of the next cycle in each phase can be on-line adjusted effectively according to the queue length of vehicle in each phase when the previous signal cycle finishes, and the queue length of the next cycle in the isolated intersection can achieve the minimum. Simulation results show that using the proposed algorithms the queue length of each phase can be obviously reduced comparing with conventional fixed-time control method, while the traffic efficiency of the intersection in one signal cycle can be fully exploited."

Fixed-point word-length optimization is a well-known research area that aims to find the optimal trade-offs between accuracy and hardware cost in bitwidth allocation signals in fixed point circuits. This work proposes a methodology to combine word-length optimization with application-specific processor customization. The goal is to optimize the following parameters in the processor architecture: (1) datatype word-lengths, (2) size of register-files and (3) architecture of the functional units. Multi-level evolutionary algorithms are employed to perform the optimization. To facilitate evaluation, a new processor design environment was developed that supports necessary customization flexibility to realize and evaluate the proposed methodology. The experimental results show that for five evaluated benchmarks, the proposed methodology can reduce the number of consumed LUTs and flip-flops by an average of 11.9% and 5.1%, respectively, while reducing the latency by an average of 33.4%."

Firstly, SRec supports the generation of recursion forests (i.e. structured collections of recursion trees) to enhance the understanding of complex, multiple recursive algorithms. Secondly, SRec supports some phases of the systematic development of dynamic programming algorithms: checking recursion redundancy, generation of the dependency graph associated to a recursion tree, and matching the graph to a table. These facilities require high degree of interactivity to be effective. The paper illustrates the new facilities with a dynamic programming algorithm for the sequence alignment problem. We successfully applied the new version of SRec to a number of algorithms, and we are currently using it in a course con advanced algorithms."

According to differences between the object and its neighboring background in different color subspaces, the suitable color subspaces, which make the object outstanding from the background, are selected and the multiple feature descriptions based on the selected color subspace are produced to represent the object. Thus, under the particle filter framework, the similarity matrix which is based on the sample feature and the location are computed. According to the similarity matrix, the algorithm determine the final object location. The results show the proposed algorithm realizes the robustness of the video object tracking to some extent."

However, the development of this kind of activities is usually a difficult task. First, making students solve motivating and challenging tasks with certain autonomy requires large efforts from the teachers. Additionally, in order to maintain the realistic flavour, it is interesting to dispose of professional resources where students can find the information they need to solve the problems without depending on the teachers inputs. As a solution to overcome these problems, the paper proposes using the resources provided by professional design contests in the development of teaching activities. To show that idea, the paper presents the results of the application of the materials from a conference design contest in an embedded design course."

It is assumed that only relative state or output measurements of the neighbors are available for each agent and only a part of the followers have access to the relative state or output information of the dynamic leader. When relative state measurements are available, a bounded distributed finite-time coordinated tracking controller is proposed for each follower based on nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) method. When only relative output measurements are available, robust exact differentiators are employed first to estimate the relative state information. Then a distributed finite-time coordinated tracking controller is designed based on the estimated relative state. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies."

The accuracy of measuring human blood pressure using pulse wave transmit velocity is significantly influenced by the accuracy of the pulse wave feature point. This paper designs a pulse waveform quality evaluation function to calculate the pulse wave quality index. The reliability evaluation of photoplethysmography (PPG) feature point selection can be evaluated by the pulse wave quality index automatically. The fusion of blood pressure value calculated by different pulse wave feature point is calculated by the Kalman filter. Thus a more accurate continuous blood pressure measurement result is got. This method is evaluated by the MIMIC database. Compared with SBP calculated by single PPG feature point, this method has the least extreme errors and the smallest root mean square error (rMSE) of systolic blood pressure(SBP)."

Therefore, analyzing the spread of an epidemic by the matroid is highly efficient In this paper, we build a matroid induced by the formal context and discuss whether an epidemic spreads easily or not by this matroid. Firstly, we define a family of sets which are proved to satisfy the circuit axiom of matroids. Therefore, a matroidal structure of the formal context can be built Secondly, in order to study E-spread information systems deeply by the matroid, a graphical representation of matroids is explored. Finally, three necessary and sufficient conditions for an epidemic to spread easily are investigated from the viewpoint of connectivity of matroid induced by the formal context, connectivity of a relevant graph, and matroid approximation operators. Investigation of the spread of an epidemic will benefit to staving off major outbreaks of communicable diseases."

TrueTime toolbox is adopted to simulate in order to analyze the effects of network-induced delay and data packet dropout on the ship course networked control system. Constant value compensation mechanism with timestamp is used when network-induced delay is considered, while constant value compensation mechanism with data packet detection module is employed when data packet dropout is considered. Simulation results show that the new controllers with compensation mechanism can reduce the oscillation and overshoot, shorten the regulating time and improve the control effect of the ship course networked control system."

It is further verified experimentally that the Brillouin precursor attenuates algebraically as compared to the exponential decay experienced by the carrier. This property of the precursor field can be exploited to design remote sensing system for imaging through dispersive medium that can reach longer propagation distances due to the lower power attenuation."

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has better global approximation performance and generalization capability. And for a better elucidation of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the algorithm is applied to the robot execution failures problem. Compared with the original ELM algorithm and existing prediction methods of robot execution failures, the classification rate of the proposed algorithm significantly improved and in 10 times' simulation, the proposed algorithm has nine times 100% classification rate, which promotes the practical application of the algorithm in the field of robotics."

The research results show that noise trader cognitive deviation and its proportion to asset price bubble formation are positive correlation. And the noise trader excessive reaction to asset price bubbles effects are not the same. When the noise traders have excessive reaction on the dividend of mean value, the influence on excessive reaction to asset price bubbles is very limited, but not to further expansion impact of the asset bubble. In contrast, when excessive reaction expand to a certain degree, excessive reaction restrain the bubbles rise. When the noise traders have excessive response on the mean of cognitive dividend mean, noise traders excessive reaction to asset price bubble was a significant positive correlation."
