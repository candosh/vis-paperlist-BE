        "abstract": "One of the major challenges of realising a Multi-Terminal DC grid has been the lack of a suitable HVDC Breaker. Previous designs of HVDC breaker were either too slow to be suitable for interrupting fast-rising fault currents or had conduction losses too high for economically viable operation on a grid. However, the new class of \"hybrid\" DC circuit breakers has fundamentally changed this position, with the potential of interrupting fault currents in a few milliseconds with negligible steady-state power losses. As part of the EU-funded \"Twenties\" project, Alstom Grid has built and tested a 120kV prototype DC breaker. The design of the breaker and the results obtained during testing are described in the paper.",

        "abstract": "Lighting variation and uneven feature distribution are main challenges for indoor RGB-D visual odometry where color information is often combined with depth information. To meet the challenges, we fuse point and line features to form a robust odometry algorithm. Line features are abundant indoors and less sensitive to lighting change than points. We extract 3D points and lines from RGB-D data, analyze their measurement uncertainties, and compute camera motion using maximum likelihood estimation. We prove that fusing points and lines produces smaller motion estimate uncertainty than using either feature type alone. In experiments we compare our method with state-of-the-art methods including a keypoint-based approach and a dense visual odometry algorithm. Our method outperforms the counterparts under both constant and varying lighting conditions. Specifically, our method achieves an average translational error that is 34.9% smaller than the counterparts, when tested using public datasets.",

        "abstract": "MVDC is starting to be considered as an option for enhancing transfer capacity and providing increased power quality at distribution networks. There is a term starting to be used of “soft open-point” which can provide controlled power transfer between two 11kV or 33kV distribution groups, without affecting short-circuit levels, voltage differences, loop flows or limitations due to phase-angle differences. The 4-quadrant converters can provide reactive power support and voltage control at each end of the link and multi-terminal is also feasible. There are future technology opportunities including enhancement of existing corridors through the conversion of existing AC lines to DC. This paper provides a technology overview as well as information on recently deployed projects ranging from linking of oil and gas platforms, through to an urban infeed. It will summarise the benefits of MVDC and the applications where it may provide a competitive or preferential alternative solution to conventional technology.",

Its main functions include bidirectional power flow, step-up and step-down operation and fault isolation equivalent to a DC circuit breaker. By contrast to the conventional MMC based DC/DC converter, the proposed DC/DC converter with hybrid MMC configuration has the advantage of being able to block the DC/DC converter terminal connecting to faulty DC grid section, while continue operating the other terminals connected to healthy DC grid sections. The proposed DC/DC converter operation is analyzed and its control is described. Simulation results using Matlab/Simulink are presented to demonstrate the robust performance during dc fault conditions.",

By introducing an impedance-conditioning term in the voltage used by the PLL, the VSC control system is virtually synchronized to the voltage at a stronger point in the grid. By synchronization to the voltage behind the corresponding virtual impedance, the proposed approach can be utilized to influence the reactive power flow of the VSC in a way that will inherently enhance the power transfer capability of the high-impedance grid. To verify the impact of the proposed approach, an analytical model of a VSC HVDC terminal is used to calculate the achievable steady-state power transfer capability, as well as the range where small-signal stability is ensured, in a grid with low SCR when applying different levels of virtual impedance in the grid synchronization. The validity of the stability assessment based on the analytical model, and the increased stability range achieved with the proposed impedance-conditioned PLL, are also verified by time-domain simulations in the Matlab/Simulink environment.",

Here we consider the particular domain of architecture, using huge collections of street-level imagery to find visual patterns that correspond to semantic-level architectural elements distinctive to particular time periods. We use this analysis both to date buildings, as well as to discover how functionally-similar architectural elements (e.g. windows, doors, balconies, etc.) have changed over time due to evolving styles. We validate the methods by combining a large dataset of nearly 150,000 Google Street View images from Paris with a cadastre map to infer approximate construction date for each facade. Not only could our analysis be used for dating or geo- localizing buildings based on architectural features, but it also could give architects and historians new tools for confirming known theories or even discovering new ones.",

        "abstract": "Voltage-Sourced Converter (VSC) HVDC is attracting significant attention as the UK tries to meet its renewable energy targets. However, compared with the traditional Current-Sourced Converter (CSC) HVDC, VSC-HVDC is more vulnerable to DC faults due to the lower DC side impedances and more sensitive power electronics used in its construction. This paper investigates the equivalent two-level converter system response under a pole-to-pole fault. A three-terminal VSC-HVDC system is developed in PSCAD/EMTDC to evaluate the system fault response and to verify theoretical analysis. Based on the results, it is found that the AC grid will initially contribute relatively little to the DC fault current seen by the DC side circuit breakers during a pole-to-pole fault. The converter fault recovery strategy has also been studied in this paper. It is found that after successful operation of the hybrid DC circuit breaker, with the aid of bump-less transfer control, the DC system has a good voltage recovery response. The contribution of this paper is that it gives an improved understanding of the system response and offers some guidance for the design of DC protection systems.",

        "abstract": "Network function virtualization provides a new network resource utilization approach which decouples network functions from proprietary hardware and enables adaptive services to end-user requests. In this paper, we present a joint design which optimally deploys network functions and allocates physical resources satisfying end-to-end requests with generated routes. We first discuss the problem behind such design and show its NP-completeness. We then propose a mixed-integer program which simultaneously identifies physical nodes to be deployed with network functions and generates routes sharing common physical resources realizing end-to-end requests. Computational results demonstrate the value of the integrated approach and its ability to allocate network functions supporting end-to-end requests with limited physical resources.",

Each Arm of the converter contains high voltage series IGBT Director Switches and full-bridge cells, which enables the VSC to ride through AC and DC network faults. This paper describes how the AAC can be optimised by modulating the converter terminal voltages with zero-phase sequence triplen harmonic components. The optimisation reduces the ratio of the number of the full-bridge cells compared to the simpler Director Switches which offers a valuable improvement in footprint and efficiency.",

DC circuit breakers are therefore necessary for the interruption of the short-circuit current especially for the reliable operation of multi-terminal HVDC systems. In this paper a calculation method of important parameters of the short-circuit current is presented. The DC short-circuit current is determined by the characteristics of the AC and DC system. The substantial influence factors are evaluated and based on the ratings of existing VSC-HVDC projects typical AC and DC impedances are derived. For different HVDC scenarios resulting short-circuit currents are calculated. The paper concludes with recommendations for the calculation of short-circuit currents in radial and meshed HVDC grids.",

Security concerns in modern industrial networks, also used in critical infrastructures, require novel monitoring techniques applicable for these constrained, real-time environments. Characteristics of these networks' traffic indicate that SVM can be a powerful tool for realizing a self-configuring monitoring for industrial infrastructures regarding attacks as kind of anomalies. This paper presents the experimental results of applying one-class SVM (OCSVM) on a number of real-world industrial traffic traces from very different industrial control systems (ICS). Initially focusing on a few network packet attributes, the results are discussed in terms of f-score, precision, and recall for different mappings of the features. The results demonstrate the high potential of using one-class SVM for monitoring packets and packet sequences in these networks.",

High power DC-DC converters are key components to realise future offshore voltage DC grids and multi-terminal HVDC systems. Different DC-DC converter topologies have been proposed for this application. The aim of this paper is to investigate the viability of Switched Capacitor (SC) converters in high power application particularly the interconnection of offshore windfarms to a medium voltage DC grid. In addition, a comparison of alternative topologies that have been proposed will be presented. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the analysis.",

A lot of publications have been published about this topology these last years since it was first proposed. Few of them are addressing explicitly the two different roles that are held by this converter in an HVDC link: power control or DC voltage level control. Moreover, for a given function, different ways of controlling this converter may be considered. This paper proposes an overview of the different solutions for controlling the MMC and proposes a methodology to synthesize the control architecture.",

        "abstract": "The connection point of a VSC-HVDC for the transmission of RES electricity, can be located far from the large generation plants, leading to a weak grid connection. This paper analyses the limitations on the power flow transfer through a VSC-HVDC system connected to a weak grid. First, the impact of the angle and voltage stability limits and the VSC rating are examined. Then, the power transfer capability curves of a VSC connected to a weak grid of an SCR of 1.1 pu by means of an L-interface are calculated. Finally, the impact of providing additional reactive power (Q) support is investigated through utilising a capacitor at the connection point. It has been shown that an additional Q-support of 0.2 pu can maintain the transfer of full power without the need for oversizing the VSC.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new control scheme for the Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) of a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) grid connecting asynchronous AC systems, so that the latter can mutually support their frequencies after a disturbance. The scheme involves no communication between VSCs. It is activated upon detection of a significant frequency deviation, with the possibility to limit the support requested from other AC systems. It relies on an integral control enforcing the frequency droop characteristics (of classical speed governors), in addition to the voltage-droop control of VSCs. The controller is tuned to emulate the response of a power plant, while avoiding excessive transients in the HVDC system, and limiting the impact on the other AC systems.",

        "abstract": "Low frequency AC (LFAC) provides an alternative to HVDC and HVAC connections for offshore wind farms. Charging current is reduced as compared to standard 50Hz or 60Hz transmission and cable length thus may be extended. LFAC links to wind farms may be interconnected to form an offshore network - a significant advantage over HVDC technology which currently lacks a matured circuit breaker technology to allow such networks. SPEN and University of Warwick, supported by Network Innovation Allowance funding in the UK, initialized a systematic study on the feasibility of an LFAC system. This paper summarises the initial design considerations. A system design for an LFAC connection is established and the key components discussed. The effect of lowering frequency upon transformer design is assessed by developing example designs for the both the wind farm and wind turbine transformer. The next stage of the study will be focused on optimisation of the components and system level simulations as well as cost benefit analysis to reveal the niche market of this technology.",

Such large links may be required to provide ancillary services such as fast frequency response or emergency power re-routing in the event of a system disturbance. Providing such services may require converters to be designed with overload capacity. This paper examines how the thermal aspects of semiconductor devices may impact the operation of such converters and how the exploitation of short-term thermal dynamics may lead to dynamic overload rating.",

        "abstract": "Circuit breakers for High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) are seen as a required technological step in the development of HVDC grids. The development of several new HVDC circuit breaker prototypes indicate that this step may be achieved in the years to come. In order to facilitate the installation of HVDC circuit breakers, appropriate standards and tests need to be developed. These tests and standards must ensure that the technology is capable of functioning as required. In cases where direct testing cannot be carried out, a synthetic test circuit is used to recreate the conditions of the power system. Voltage testing envelopes are used to define the specification of these synthetic test circuits for Alternating Current (AC) circuit breakers. A similar concept can be applied to fault currents in HVDC networks, allowing specifications for HVDC synthetics test circuits to be defined. Testing envelopes which encapsulate the fault currents are analytically shown in this paper and compared to detailed simulations of faults in a VSC HVDC system. Testing envelopes can be drawn for a range of converter topologies in point-to-point and multi-terminal applications. Taking into account the large power electronic elements in the recently developed HVDC circuit breakers, discussion is given to the definition the worst case fault for a HVDC protection system. This paper demonstrates that a terminal fault is not necessarily the worst fault scenario for HVDC circuit breaker.",

        "abstract": "The demand of reactive power in the last mile of the networks is increasing by the time due to the change of loading types by time, beside increasing the total demand itself where new technologies are being introduced depend mainly on different types of electrical support such as electrical cars and more electronic devices in consumption process [1]. This expected situation would lead to take into consideration new approaches in the last mile substations in order to mitigate the drawbacks of the conventional legacy and that by providing more functions in the last mile substations that could provide more flexibility and functionality regarding voltage level, reactive power (RP), amount of demand and losses [1]. This paper focuses the light on the consideration that are taken in designing a distribution transformer that provide additional abilities in regulating the voltage and controlling the RP that is injected in the distribution network (DN) by using a fractional rated converter that is attached partially with the windings of the transformer. This approach aims mainly to enhance the unit with more flexibility in controlling the flow the of the RP at the last mile of the network in order to decrease the losses that are caused by transmitting RP through long transmission networks. The design of the power electronics (PE) modules is detailed and its functionality in compensating Var power is discussed. This approach contributes in meeting the future expectations of the low voltage (LV) networks changes and loading, this contribution is comprised of providing the substation unit with fractional rated power electronic converter that is attached partially with the winding of the LV transformer to provide the load with a specific level of its demand from RP, whereby the solid state switches are controlled according to the immediate need for Var control and support in low voltage (LV) networks [1].",

        "abstract": "Image segmentation is the key component of identifying plant leaf diseases. Most of the available techniques for leaf disease segmentation use grayscale values. In this paper, an automatic seeded region growing (SRG) algorithm for coloured images proposed by Y. Shih and S. Cheng is modified for segmentation of plant leaf diseases. The colour difference between adjacent regions is computed using Euclidean distance metric in the algorithm. This paper proposes a novel two dimensional look up table for labeling the neighbours for region merging. The look up table is created by traversing the image vertically and horizontally and any change in the labels of pixel is noted in the table. The incorporation of the table helps in better organization in region merging step and helps in further segmentation of the image. It must be noted that the performance of coloured image segmentation largely depends on the colour space chosen. The algorithm is first implemented in the YCbCr colour space and then implemented in other colour spaces like YCgCr, CIELAB and RGB to check for the best performance of the segmentation algorithm. Experimental results show that the SRG algorithm along with the proposed modification for region merging give good results in the YCbCr compared to other colour spaces for plant leaf disease segmentation.",

        "abstract": "Using multiple accelerators, such as GPUs or Xeon Phis, is attractive to improve the performance of large data parallel applications and to increase the size of their workloads. However, writing an application for multiple accelerators remains today challenging because going from a single accelerator to multiple ones indeed requires to deal with potentially non-uniform domain decomposition, inter-accelerator data movements, and dynamic load balancing. Writing such code manually is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a new programming tool called STEPOCL along with a new domain specific language designed to simplify the development of an application for multiple accelerators. We evaluate both the performance and the usefulness of STEPOCL with three applications and show that: (i) the performance of an application written with STEPOCL scales linearly with the number of accelerators, (ii) the performance of an application written using STEPOCL competes with a handwritten version, (iii) larger workloads run on multiple devices that do not fit in the memory of a single device, (iv) thanks to STEPOCL, the number of lines of code required to write an application for multiple accelerators is roughly divided by ten.",

        "abstract": "Digital images, especially color images, are very widely used, as well as traded via Internet, e-mail and posting on websites. Images have a large size which allows embedding secret messages of large size, so they are a good medium for digital steganography. The main goal of steganalysis is to detect the presence of hidden messages in digital media. In this paper, we propose a steganalysis method based on color feature correlation and machine learning classification. Fusing features with features obtained from color-rich models allows to increase the detect ability of hidden messages in the color images. Our novel proposition uses the correlation between different channels of color images. Features are extracted from the channel correlation and co-occurrence correlation. In this work, all stego images are created with a range of different payload sizes using two steganography S-UNIWARD and WOW algorithms. To validate the proposed method, his efficiency is demonstrated by comparison with color rich model steg analysis.",

        "abstract": "The realization of multi-terminal HVDC grids requires availability of adequate fault handling methods. This includes techniques for fault detection and location, and dc-breakers for faults clearing. The characteristics and consequences of dc-side faults are very different compared to ac-system faults, and conventional ac-protection methods are not necessarily suited in HVDC grids. This paper presents a study on fault detection in radial offshore HVDC grids, with emphasis on the identification of suitable fault detection criteria based on local measurements, referred to as markers. For selection of the best suited marker, four different requirements have been applied; dependability, speed, security and selectivity. This implies that all relevant dc-faults must be detected as fast as possible, and no other transient events should be detected as faults. In addition it must be possible to identify the faulted section/cable for all relevant faults based on local measurements, to allow for selective disconnection. The work is based on simulations of a radial three-terminal VSC HVDC system in PSCAD.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) relaying system, where a source node transfers information and a fraction of power simultaneously over OFDM to a relay node, and the relay node uses the harvested power from the source node to forward the source information to the destination. To support such simultaneous information and energy cooperation, we propose two transmission protocols, namely power splitting (PS) relaying protocol and the transmission mode adaptation (TMA) protocol for without/with the source-destination link, respectively. For both transmission protocols, joint resource allocation problems are formulated to maximize the system throughput. By using the Lagrange dual method, we develop efficient algorithms to find the optimal polices of the nonconvex optimization problems.",

Present solutions are based around conventional medium-voltage AC architectures. This paper proposes an alternative DC collection network based around modular DC/DC converters with input-parallel-output-series (IPOS) connection. Small-signal analysis of the converter is presented, to assist in control scheme development for the converter input and output stages. A Lyapunov controller is embedded within the conventional output voltage sharing control loop. A master-slave control scheme is proposed to ensure power sharing under a range of operating conditions, and provides fault-tolerant operation since the status of `master' can be reallocated in the event that the present `master' module fails.",

        "abstract": "Bugs of different severities have so far been put into the same category, but their characteristics differ significantly. Moreover, the nature of issues with the same severity, e.g., high, differs markedly between desktops and smartphones. To understand these differences, we perform an empirical study on 72 Android and desktop projects. We first define three bug severity classes: high, medium, and low. Next, we study how severity changes and quantify differences between classes in terms of bug-fixing attributes. Then, we focus on topic differences: using LDA, we extract topics associated with each severity class, and study how these topics differ across classes, platforms, and over time. Our findings include: severity and priority affect bug fixing time; medium-severity contributors are more experienced than high-severity contributors; and there have been more concurrency and cloud-related high-severity bugs on desktop since 2009, while on Android concurrency bugs are prevalent.",

By proposing a new method called adding an extra observer, two novel adaptive output feedback consensus protocols are proposed to achieve consensus for any strongly connected directed graph. The proposed adaptive output feedback protocols are fully distributed, relying on only the agent dynamics and the local output information of neighboring agents. A sufficient condition for the existence of the proposed adaptive protocols is that each agent is stabilizable and detectable.",

The Big Data performance challenge arises whenever the volume or velocity of data overwhelms current processing systems and techniques, resulting in performance that falls far short of desired. Three approaches to improving the performance by orders of magnitude are: 1) Scale down the amount of data processed or the resources needed to perform the processing; 2) Scale up the computing resources on a node, via parallel processing and faster memory/storage technologies; and 3) Scale out the computing to distributed nodes in a cluster/cloud or at the edge where the data resides.

Noting the somewhat limited compute and battery life of today's devices, we present a computationally efficient approach to gesture recognition that can be effectively used inside an app running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware, such as an Android Smart watch. Our approach has two phases. The first phase is to construct finite state machines (FSM) for gesture recognition. We present a novel approach - which leverages techniques from functional programming languages - to define rich yet compact FSM. Such FSM can be further tuned for higher accuracy with help of some training data and a suitable optimization method - this is the second phase. To demonstrate effectiveness, we created a gesture recognition system for an automotive scenario as an Android Smart watch app and then tuned the gesture recognition engine using Cultural Algorithms optimization and training data. We achieved 77% gesture recognition accuracy which is on par which more computationally intensive techniques such as Hidden Markov Models.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a system topology for potential use as a Wireless Networked Control System (WNCS). The topology has a plant to be regulated, a dedicated controller that makes control decisions, and an intermediate network of nodes. The network assists the controller in stabilizing the closed-loop system and provides the means for connecting the sensors and actuators of the plant and the inputs and outputs of the controller. Further, the paper presents a framework for modelling the closed-loop system such that controller and network systems can be designed. The paper also provides an LMI-based algorithm for computing optimal controller and network systems that achieve a stable closed-loop system while meeting performance measures. The deigned systems have a fixed structure and hence the associated design complexity is reduced. Finally, the paper also illustrates with examples the effectiveness of the proposed design and computational procedures.",

The interface uses two simple gestures for building and playing composition-appropriate immersive environments. A horizontal-finger gesture allows users to place note “wedges” from a virtual keyboard and to move them between snapping grids with their own local coordinate systems. A vertical-finger gesture allows users to play the notes and chords by striking the wedges like strings, with the velocity determining the volume of the sounds.",

        "abstract": "With the increased levels of offshore wind power penetration into power systems, the impact of offshore wind power on stability of power systems require more investigation. In this paper, the effects of a large scale doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based offshore wind farm (OWF) on power system stability are examined. The OWF is connected to the main onshore grid through a voltage source converter (VSC) based high voltage direct current (HVDC) link. A large scale DFIG based OWF is connected to the New England 10-machine 39-bus test system through a VSC-HVDC. One of the synchronous generators in the test system is replaced by an OWF with an equivalent generated power. As the voltage source converter can control the active and reactive power independently, the use of the onshore side converter to control its terminal voltage is investigated. The behaviour of the test system is evaluated under both small and large grid disturbances in both cases with and without the offshore wind farm.",

The system consists of mini weather stations that are commanded by a central station which processes the data collected and based on these, it generates alarms, either by falling frost or the appearance of Zonda winds. The system, in addition to the occurrence of Zonda winds can predict with several hours in advance of possible frost formation, giving the farmer a very useful tool when having to deal with such events.",

We propose to model each dataset by a compact Gaussian mixture which is designed for the specific purpose of colour transfer between images which have different scene content. A non rigid transformation is estimated by minimising the Euclidean distance (L2) between these two distributions and the estimated transformation is used for transfering colour statistics from one image to another. Experimental results show that this is a very promising approach for transferring colour and it performs very well against an alternative reference approach. ",

Performance of HVDC systems has significantly improved with the emergence of voltage source converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC). Increased controllability provides independent control of active and reactive power which facilitates controlling of voltage and frequency. This paper investigates the frequency control capability of VSC-HVDC to determine the improvement extent that VSC HVDC systems provide for the frequency recovery and system inertia. Two frequency control strategies using dc voltage and active power outer loops are investigated. The analysis is carried out using a time domain simulator, where the tie line in the Kundur test system is replaced by VSC-HVDC. Simulation results have shown that frequency control capability of VSC-HVDC dramatically improves the frequency performance, especially in isolated power systems.",

In this paper, we show that the massive use of network coding throughout the network significantly improves latency and reduces the frequency of packet re-transmission. Thus, an architecture built around network coding may be a feasible road towards realizing the tactile internet vision. Our contribution is threefold: (i) we show how network coding improves latency and reduces packet re-transmission with respect to other coding schemes analytically, (ii) we present our implementation of a network coding capable software router and support our analytical results with realistic measurements, and (iii) we show that, in contrast with current packet-switched networks, network coding can be seamlessly integrated in Software Defined Networks (SDN) using our software router as a Virtual Network Function. Such combination of network coding and SDN summons a codecentric networking architecture that can be a promising host to future 5G systems.",

        "abstract": "When using HVDC there are two available commercial possibilities: Transmissions based on Line Commutated Converters (LCC) and based on Voltage Source Converters (VSC). VSC-HVDC is more suitable for creating offshore grids. Despite this fact, many LCC transmission systems are in operation across the sea interconnecting mainlands or islands. This work addresses the concept of connecting wind power plants in series with an LCC-HVDC transmission link already built by means of a self-commutating Current Source Converter (CSC). The idea is similar to series tapping stations which can extract power form the HVDC link. Nevertheless, a CSC can act as a rectifier or inverter, so power reversal is available and has the same advantages of a VSC. The coupling between LCC stations and the CSC is straightforward since both topologies are current source converters. The control and operation of the system under normal conditions is presented and verified by means of simulations using MATLAB Simulink.",

        "abstract": "A power loss model of a single-switch non-isolated dc/dc converter is developed in this paper. The converter is formed by combining a buck converter with a buck-boost converter. It can be used in a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV)-battery powered pump system. With only a single transistor, the converter is able to efficiently perform three tasks simultaneously, namely, maximum power point tracking (MPPT), battery charging and driving the pump at constant flow rate. The conduction and switching losses of each individual components of the converter and the inductor core loss are calculated and analyzed when the two inductors operate in different modes. The analysis shows that the output stage inductor and power diode are the major contributors to the total power loss. A 14W laboratory prototype converter is built and the experimental results are compared with the model analysis.",

Its tunability comes from the varying conductivity of graphene biased by external voltage.

The promising results provide an alternative using graphene for tunable transmission lines.",

        "abstract": "Earlier work on calculating maximum power curves (MPCs) and maximum available power (MAPs) for VSC converters was not consistent with the way it is done for LCC converters. This paper attempts to use an approach consistent with LCCs by using a Thévenin voltage that is calculated to give 1.0 pu terminal voltage at rated power and unity power factor for the VSC. The MAP values calculated using this approach are considerably larger than those calculated using earlier approaches. The paper also discusses how the MAP is reduced when voltage limits for the VSC's internal voltage are considered. The paper also identifies problems with this consistent approach, as the Thévenin voltage at low SCR can be significantly greater than 1.0 pu. In the LCC this apparent voltage is adjusted by tap changer operation, and if a similar action is taken for the VSC, an unreasonably large tap ranger range would have to be assumed for a low SCR. As an alternative, the paper considers an ac network where some reactive power is locally supplied by shunt capacitors, which makes a Thévenin voltage close to 1.0 pu possible, and recommends that such a network be used when calculating the MPCs and MAP for a VSC converter.",

By parameterizing the unknown nonlinear terms, a distributed adaptive consensus algorithm is proposed for each follower agent. With a modified labeling rule, consensus analysis is conducted for the multi-agent systems with jointly connected topology based on algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov theory. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "Environmental concerns, system security and energy efficiency requirements are posing special demands on power transmission options. Particularly, increased bulk power transmission, as well as large-scale integration of renewable energy sources act as main drivers for the development of HVDC technology. This paper deals with the development of a reliability/availability model for Voltage-Source Converter HVDC (VSC-HVDC) transmission systems for offshore and onshore applications, such as offshore wind farms connection or DC interconnectors. The goal of the present work is to develop vendor independent model for system reliability studies and sensitivity analysis of system availability. The proposed method overcomes the constraints that the currently dominating reliability and availability analysis methods introduce. A novel modelling tool - based on Bayesian Network theory - will be capable of serving as valuable asset towards design optimization and operational strategy of VSCHVDC systems. Two component-based modelling approaches are demonstrated within this study. The first is based on the Boolean logic of “operating” or “not operating” element, promising identical results with Fault Tree Analysis, but enabling identification of the weakest point in the system and sensitivity analysis as well. The second approach takes into consideration the distributive character of real components availability data, integrating in such a way uncertainty in the estimated output system availability.",

This is demonstrated in this work for a full bridge inverter without a priori knowledge of the mission profile to which the converter is a subsystem, with the objective to reduce the thermal cycling without measurement of the junction temperature.

However, fast and accurate analysis of the samples remains a bottleneck. Here we present D4RAGenS, a genetic sequence identification algorithm that exhibits the Big Data handling and computational power of the Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data Model (D4M). The method leverages linear algebra and statistical properties to increase computational performance while retaining accuracy by subsampling the data. Two run modes, Fast and Wise, yield speed and precision tradeoffs, with applications in biodefense and medical diagnostics. The D4RAGenS analysis algorithm is tested over several datasets, including three utilized for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) metagenomic algorithm contest.",

        "abstract": "The recently proposed parallel hybrid modular multilevel converter is considered to be a low loss, low component count converter with soft switching capability of the `main' bridge. The converter has similar advantages to other emerging modular multilevel converter circuits being considered for HVDC power transmission. However, during ac network unbalance the individual `chain-links' exchange unequal amounts of power with the grid which requires appropriate remedial action. This paper presents research into the performance of the converter and proposes a suitable control method that enables the converter to operate during grid voltage unbalance. The proposed control concept involves the use of asymmetric third harmonic voltage generation in the `chain-links' of the converter to redistribute the power exchanged between the individual `chain-links' and the grid. Mathematical analysis and simulation modelling with results are presented to support the work described.",

To deal with the parameter differences between the plant and the model, an adaptation mechanism is introduced to the model-based event-triggered control systems. Based on the separation property of model-based event-triggered control, the problem is divided into two independent parts, i.e., (i) the design of controller gain matrix and event condition, and (ii) the design of adaptation laws. Then the methods are proposed to solve these two independent parts, which guarantee both the asymptotic stability of systems and the reduction of parameter differences between the plant and the model. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the obtained results.",

A methodology for an optimal steady-state operation of a MTDC system based on DC-ISO objectives has been presented in this paper. This paper proposes the use of a type linear equality constraints based on nodal analysis to include DC-ISO operational mode to the OPF. Proposed methodology has been demonstrated and tested with a 7-node HVDC system, and results show the compromise in solutions to cope with OPF.",

To analyse the stability of the interconnected system, the impedance-based Nyquist stability analysis method is employed. The analytical ac-side small-signal impedance model of a three-phase MMC is first developed in this paper. The analytical impedance model is verified by means of injecting a small perturbation voltage/current signal in a nonlinear time-domain simulation model. The impacts of the controller parameters on the stability of the interconnected system are then examined by using frequency-domain analysis approach, which can offer guidance for controller parameters design. Finally, the time-domain simulation results validate the theoretical analysis.",

        "abstract": "We consider a cognitive radio network, where primary users (PUs) share their spectrum with energy harvesting (EH) enabled secondary users (SUs), conditioned on a limited SUs' interference at PU receivers. Due to the lack of information exchange between SUs and PUs, the SU-PU interference channels are subject to uncertainty in channel estimation. Besides channel uncertainty, SUs' EH profile is also subject to spatial and temporal variations, which enforce an energy causality constraint on SUs' transmit power control and affect SUs' interference at PU receivers. Considering both the channel and EH uncertainties, we propose a robust design for SUs' power control to maximize SUs' throughput performance. Our robust design targets at the worst-case interference constraint to provide a robust protection for PUs, while guarantees a transmission probability to reflect SUs' minimum QoS requirements. To make the non-convex throughput maximization problem tractable, we develop a convex approximation for each robust constraint and successfully design a successive approximation approach that converges to the global optimum of the throughput objective. Simulations show that SUs will change transmission strategies according to PUs' sensitivity to interference, and we also exploit the impact of SUs' EH profile (e.g., mean, variance, and correlation) on SUs' power control.",

Along with the development of social media applications, an increasing number of people combine texts and images to express their opinions. However, text based sentiment analysis methods cannot process other medias except texts. Therefore, visual sentiment analysis is born at the right moment. In this article, we review two multimodal-based visual sentiment analysis models proposed in our group. Both model exploit the multimodal content from correlation and hyper graph view respectively. In the Multimodal Correlation Model (MCM), we observe the correlation among different modalities and model then through a probabilistic graphical model. In the Hyper graph Learning Model (HLM), we use hyper graph to model the independence of each modality. We further discuss the underneath challenges and foresee potential opportunities of this direction.",

However, the displacement of conventional thermoelectric power plants due to RES development can hinder safe operation of LCC-HVDC converters, especially during inverter operation, mainly due to the reduction of short circuit power on the ac network. These issues are exacerbated in small insulated networks with multi-infeed HVDC systems, such as the Sardinian one. Synthetic indexes such as MIIF, CFII and MIESCR, as well as time-domain simulations, are used to assess the robustness of the AC-DC system in presence of RES. Countermeasures such as converter control system improvements and installation of synchronous condensers are evaluated, aiming at a larger penetration of distributed generation.",

Aiming at the condition that near the aeroengine's stable operating points, model parameters are unknown but unchanged with time, this thesis designs aeroengine model reference adaptive control system based on the Lyapunov stability theory, by choosing Lyapunov function, in the case of keeping the system stable, the adaptive parameter adjustment law is obtained. Last but not least, this thesis proposes improvement measures to deal with the shaking rotating speed problem of the aeroengine model reference adaptive control system as the use of the Lyapunov method. By simulation experiments, the results prove that the designed control system can realize adaptive state tracking control of aeroengine, and as well meet the performance index requirements for the aeroengine's control system.",

However, the disturbance caused by the grid fault is so large that the output of the PV inverter would be saturated, which means the controller of the PV inverter would operate in nonlinear area. Consequently, the fault current transient features of the PV power generator are very complicated and much different from the steady-state fault characteristics. Aimed at it, the fault current transient features of the PV power generator are studied comprehensively in this paper, by taking the non-linearity of the PV inverter controller into consideration. The research results of this paper are of great importance for the establishment of equivalent model of PV power generator and fault analysis of the power grid with PV power generators.",

In this paper, we use the fact that different images have different noise characteristics, according to the camera and lighting conditions during the image acquisition. The proposed method automatically detects image splicing in raw images by highlighting local noise inconsistencies within a quadtree scan of the image. The image noise is modelized by both Gaussian and Poisson noise components. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method on several images generated with an automated image splicing.",

The proposed converter adopts the non-inverting buck-boost topology that enables wide-range voltage conversion. Furthermore, a new hybrid control scheme for achieving highly efficient power conversion is introduced. A 2.5 kW hardware prototype based on SiC-MOSFETs is fabricated and tested for performance verification. Experimental results show that the prototype achieves an efficiency of more than 97% at 4% load and an efficiency of more than 99% around the rated operating point.",

The injection of harmonics by the transformer power electronics however, complicates the core loss calculations of such a transformer. The standard Steinmetz Equation is no longer valid and the alternative loss equations proposed in the literature are significantly more complicated. Therefore, many in the industry still use the Steinmetz Equation with the signal's Fourier Transform. However, the literature suggests this to be inaccurate without quantifying it. This paper will therefore compare the accuracy of this approach to a prominent alternative presented in the literature, the improved Generalised Steinmetz Equation.",

        "abstract": "One of the most challenging aspects regarding realization of meshed HVDC systems are DC line faults. On the one hand new fault clearing equipment needs to be developed. On the other hand it is very important to define suitable fault detection methods. This is necessary since proven methods for AC grids cannot be applied in DC grids since they are too slow to cope with DC fault current phenomena. To clear DC faults it is important to have fast acting fault clearing but at least equally important to have very fast fault detection. For time critical and economical reasons it is also required to have a decentralized fault detection method. This paper describes basically DC fault current calculation, shows typical HVDC fault current characteristics and proposes an appropriate DC fault detection methodology for pole to pole as well as for pole to earth (in low- and high-impedance earthed DC grids) faults. Finally this fault detection algorithm is validated by numerical case studies.",

The fuzzy logic system is used for approximating the unknown nonlinear functions. For estimating the parameters of the fuzzy systems and some unknown bounds, a set of adaptation laws are appropriately designed. The boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop system as well as the asymptotic convergence of the underlying tracking errors to the origin are established based on a Lyapunov analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy adaptive controller is illustrated throughout simulation results.",

For instance, Luneburg lens antennas have the refractive index distribution of n(r)= [2 − (r/a)2]1/2. They can achieve one focus on its surface and the other focus at infinity. Inhomogeneous dielectrics can also be used to increase the gain and narrow the beam width of a horn antenna. Moreover, inhomogeneous dielectrics can be realized by a fast and economic manufacturing method, additive manufacturing (AM), which is also called 3D printing technology. It enables 3D fabrication of arbitrary shape and structure by printing layer by layer. By changing the mixing ratio of multiple 3D printing materials, spatially varying dielectric constants can be achieved.",

The transmitter and receiver board have some advantages with a strong mobility, low cost and high sensitivity. Manchester encoding, decoding algorithm and serial communication interface are designed by Verilog HDL. Implemented on Alter FPGA development system DE2.",

The static and dynamic characteristics were evaluated and the turnon loss is 38% lower and the reverse recovery loss is 83% lower than the conventional all-Si IGBT module. The peak value of the radiation noise from the hybrid module is almost same as the all-Si module if the collector current is less than 300A. Power dissipation losses of the hybrid module in AC 690V inverter system were calculated and confirmed that the module is useful as a power module for high efficiency AC690V inverter system.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) for X-band sensing applications. It employs a SIW Rotman Lens (RL) as a beam switching network. A prototype lens is designed with 7 beam ports and 9 array ports. The simulated results around the frequency of 10-GHz demonstrate the validity of the proposed design and scanning capability over±24°. The design process of the proposed microwave lens for X-band sensing application is implemented in SIW technology. In this work, a new lens with SIW technology is proposed to feed an array antenna to generate multiple beams. Since multiple beams are possible to be simultaneously obtained by reusing the antenna aperture, frequency and multiple functions can be incorporated in a single electronic system. The simulated results around the frequency of 10-GHz demonstrate. The proffered lens, which is comprised of seven beam ports, nine array ports and eight dummy ports, was designed to operate at the center frequency of 10-GHz, on an RO5880 substrate with electric permittivity of 2.2 and thickness of 0.508mm. The proposed Rotman lens is designed for a nine linear array radiation elements. Seven beam ports were implemented in the proposed lens to generate seven beams at 0°, ±8°, ±16° and ±24±, respectively.",

In recent years, synthesis has made major steps from a theoretists dream towards a practical design tool. While synthesis from a language like LTL has very high complexity, synthesis can be quite practical when we are willing to compromise on the specification formalism. Similarly, we can take a pragmatic approach to synthesize small distributed systems, a problem that is in general undecidable.",

        "abstract": "Device-to-Device (D2D) communication in cellular networks allows dynamic frequency reuse even within a cell, which can increase the frequency reuse factor beyond one. To perform dynamic reuse, it must be feasible for all links to maintain a certain signal quality despite the presence of interference. This can be ensured using reuse feasibility tests. However, state of the art testing algorithms show erroneous behavior when infeasibility occurs due to limited transmission powers. In this paper we develop two testing algorithms, based on nonnegative matrix theory, that explicitly take limited transmission powers into account and show how these can be implemented in protocols. The protocols are compared with the state of the art in terms of control channel usage, speed and accuracy of decision making. We find that the proposed protocols estimate reuse feasibility more accurately than the state of the art and are comparable in terms of speed and control channel usage.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a reduced order mathematical model for the VSC converter and its controls by linearizing the combined set of equations of the power system and controller. The reduced order model can preserve the unstable characteristic of the VSC system and provide an explicit mathematical expression for the system eigenvalues. This analytical formula can directly reveal by simple inspection relationships between the system stability and system parameters. Results show that small signal stability of the system is significantly affected by the ac system strength (SCR) and the Phased Locked Loop (PLL) parameters. Also, small signal stability is more sensitive to the ac voltage controller's gain than to the power controller gains. Compared with the previous developed full order model, the reduced order model can give more insights and constructive suggestions how to adjust the parameters of the control system of VSC. In particular, it is shown that by increasing the value of the voltage controller's integral gain the system can be made to operate at an SCR which is very close to the theoretical minimum SCR limit.",

We inspired by SAP systems to get better understanding of the structure of ERP systems, and to propose a web based ERP application. Afterwards, we illustrated how we improved the proposed web based ERP application to support the customization process in multi tenant environment. The proposed framework is based on a strong architecture that manages and controls the customizing of the tenants to tailor the cloud ERP system without affecting each other.",

        "abstract": "An antenna is an essential component of any communications or radar system, acting as a transducer between free-space and the transmitting or receiving system. As a key antenna parameter, antenna gain is a measure of the extent to which the antenna transmits or receives energy preferentially in a given direction. Of the many measurement techniques for determining the gain of an antenna, the most accurate is the three-antenna extrapolation technique, in which measurements made in the near-field are extrapolated to give the infinite range, far-field gain. A metrology-level antenna gain measurement facility based on this technique has been developed at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China. This paper present a practical gain calibration of a WR10 (75 GHz - 110 GHz) standard gain horn (SGH) as an example of the verification of the new facility's performance. An expanded uncertainty of as low as ±0.06 dB has been achieved.",

        "abstract": "A new topology for the single-stage grid connection of Photovoltaic (PV) system is proposed in this paper. PV inverters of various types have been proposed previously. Modular multilevel inverter, MMI(HB) using half-bridge submodules is recent and a potential candidate for PV application. Conventionally, the DC link of MMI has a centralized large DC source e.g. PV system connected across it. In the proposed topology, distributed PV system e.g. PV strings/ arrays are connected directly across dc link of MMI(HB) submodules (SMs). This allows easy expansion, independent monitoring of each PV string voltage and maximum power point optimization. The dynamics of PV generator is different from the conventional power generator, hence, a new combination of MPPT and decoupled dq controller is proposed to maximize the real power output from the PV strings and limit reactive power exchange with the grid as per the system requirements. In order to validate the proposed concept of new single-stage grid connected PV topology and its controller, simulations were conducted. A detailed model of the proposed 1800W, PV system consisting of 36 PV modules connected across a 13 level three phase MMI (HB) was established. The simulation results of new PV system during fast changes in solar irradiation and reactive power exchange has confirmed the feasibility of proposed MMI(HB) interface for single-stage grid connected high voltage, high power PV system and has verified the validity of the control strategy adopted.",

In this paper, the transmission mechanism of servo system is equivalent to a torsion spring, and the entire flexible connection servo system is simplified into a motor-spring-load two-mass system, then the mathematical model of the flexible connection servo system is established through theoretical analysis. Since the mechanical resonant frequency of the system will change with time and environment, the parameters of notch filter must be adjusted online with the resonant frequency. In this paper, according to the application requirements of mechanical resonance online suppressing, the mechanical resonance online suppressing algorithm based on adaptive IIR notch filter is proposed. Using a recursive least squares algorithm, resonant frequency of the system is online estimated, and then the frequency parameters of notch filter are adjusted online. The simulation results show the effectiveness of this method.",

        "abstract": "Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications using large antenna arrays at the base station carries the promise for significantly increasing data rate and user density in next generation (\"5G\") wireless cellular systems. This paper reports on first downlink channel measurements using a scalable 64-element antenna array that enables flexible spatially distributed configurations, applying an LTE-signal format at a carrier frequency of 2590MHz. We compare a planar array geometry with both a horizontal and vertical antenna element arrangement, respectively. To quantify pairwise (two-user) orthogonality, we evaluate the cross-correlation between channel vectors averaged over more than 400 terminal positions. We benchmark those orthogonality relations among user positions with the reference case of an idealized channel matrix based on i.i.d. complex Gaussian distributed channel coefficients, as widely used in computer simulation. Furthermore, we compare indoor with outdoor measurements and find that, for both cases, further system gains may be achieved by increasing the number of base station antennas, in particular for the horizontal antenna geometry.",

Then, it is worth noting the need of assuring the pavement rehabilitation quality of public roads, especially those classified as “Regular” or “Bad”. Pavement integral evaluation includes tests such as computing the International Friction Index (IFI), the International Roughness Index (IRI), performing geotechnical and deflectometry studies, and visual inspection of surface defects. In this work, pavement and base layers local thickness estimation based on computer vision methods is proposed. The pavement and base layers thickness estimation are part of geotechnical studies, providing structural properties of flexible pavements. Pavement and base layers thickness were computed using texture filters applied to stitched images acquired from an industrial video-scope. The results reported in this work are focused on comparing between different methods to estimate pavement and base layers thickness.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the circuit which is to reduce the number of switching elements in comparison to a common multi-level inverter NPC inverter. Increasing the number of levels of the output voltage at reduced circuit number switching elements, and performs waveform improvement. Typically, the ratio of the input voltage of the multi-level inverter is E1 : E2 = 1 : 1. When the ratio of the input voltage is 1 : 1, the number of the levels of the output voltage becomes only five-levels. Therefore, it increases the number of levels of the output voltage to a level seven by setting the ratio of the input voltage is E1 : E2=1 : 2. It is subjected to waveform improvement by increasing the number of levels of output voltage. Reducing the number of switching elements is advantageous for downsizing of the cost of the surface and the circuit. The simulated and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of seven-level operation in 6-switches inverter. Furthermore, this paper confirms same loss characteristics of the proposed multi-level inverter compare to the conventional NPC inverter.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the lateral control of intelligent vehicles. It is based on the passivity results presented recently in [1]. It shows how the intrinsic properties of the lateral dynamics can be used to design robust controllers for tracking of a reference trajectory. The additional passivity properties proved in this paper allow to theoretically explain some previous results in the literature. Then a PI controller based on the state feedback of passive outputs is proposed. Simulation validation was performed using real data representing common driving situations. Data acquisition has been made using the vehicle DYNA of Heudiasyc laboratory. This validation serves to highlight the improvement provided by the proposed approach.",

We aim to monitor public opinions and other valuable discoveries by using the data collected from social network website Sina Weibo. This paper present a distributed web crawler framework called SWORM, which runs on the Raspberry Pi (cheap card-sized single-board computer) for fetching the micro-blog data and overwhelms the traditional web crawlers on efficiency, scale, scalability and cost. The framework can easily be extended according to the specific needs of the user with the help of some simple python scripts. This paper first propose a model for micro-blog network to confirm what and how our crawler will crawl from social website. Secondly it will introduce the implementation details of the whole distributed system and finally will present experimental results. We ran some crawlers within our framework on the Raspberry Pi and stored the obtained resources in Shared MongoDB which is a category of NoSQL. Experimental results demonstrated that the use of distributed framework can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy for collecting data.",

In the contrast, a multiple-objective mathematical model for the bin packing problem with multiple constraints is formulated. In an environment with finite packing resources, two novel bin packing algorithms are proposed in this paper. Therein, each bin is first given with a predefined filllevel. Then the bin will pack items by utilizing the first fit bin packing strategy when its current filllevel is no more than the threshold, or it will be closed. Experiments and analysis are carried out by the comparison with the traditional typical packing algorithms, which verifies the efficiency of the algorithm.",

Compared with the existing dead-zone model, the slope of dead-zone is a fuzzy value in this paper.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a relaying system which consists of a multiple-antenna source node (SN), M single-antenna destination nodes (DNs) and a multiple-antenna relay node (RN). The RN possesses a buffer and it is able to store the decoded message before retransmitting the message to the DNs. We use the joint link-and-user scheduling method to maximize the long term average achievable rate of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying system. The optimal scheduling criteria is obtained and a two-step approach is proposed to implement it. In addition, we propose a rate allocation scheme of the source-relay (S-R) link to preserve the flow conservation constraint of each individual user. Furthermore, two reduced complexity joint link-and-user scheduling methods which use the zero forcing (ZF) beamforming in the relay-destination (RD) link are investigated. It is shown that joint link-and-user scheduling can significantly increase the average achievable rate of the system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we use the witness-functions to analyze cryptographic protocols for secrecy under nonempty equational theories. The witness-functions are safe metrics used to compute security. An analysis with a witness-function consists in making sure that the security of every atomic message does not decrease during its lifecycle in the protocol. The analysis gets more difficult under nonempty equational theories. Indeed, the intruder can take advantage of the algebraic properties of the cryptographic primitives to derive secrets. These properties arise from the use of mathematical functions, such as multiplication, addition, exclusive-or or modular exponentiation in the cryptosystems and the protocols. Here, we show how to use the witness-functions under nonempty equational theories and we run an analysis on the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol under the cipher homomorphism. This analysis reveals that although this protocol is proved secure under the perfect encryption assumption, its security collapses under the homomorphic primitives. We show how the witness-functions help to illustrate an attack scenario on it and we propose an amended version to fix it.",

        "abstract": "Traditional approaches to transmission system security assessment use deterministic criteria e.g. the application of `N-1' or `N-2' circuit depletion under prescribed heavy system loading conditions. However, such worst-case deterministic approach does not provide explicitly an assessment of the probability of overloading the system, and the likelihood of the outages is treated equally. Recent research has focused on assessment of the line overloading risk index. This paper aims to extend the evaluation of the line overloading risk index through an extensive systematic evaluation of the steady state performance of the Dubai transmission network under hour-by-hour loading levels over a one year period. Load flow analysis is carried out for the intact system and all N-1 and N-2 contingencies. Over the same annual period, the thermal rating of all transmission lines is calculated, based on a detailed set of local meteorological data. Power flow computations are performed using a commercial load flow program and the systematic multiple study execution and data handling was achieved using a developed C++ based programming code. Over the period studied, the line overloading risk index and the probability distributions of line loadings and ratings is determined.",

        "abstract": "Distributed control can be applied to a virtual power plant (VPP) to allocate electrical power among distributed generators (DGs). By using consensus algorithm and selecting the incremental cost of each DG as the consensus variable, economic dispatch of the VPP can be realized in a distributed manner. Therefore, only local communication among DGs is required and some performance limitations caused by centralized control can be avoided as well. However, the slow convergence speed is of concern in the distributed control. In this paper, mathematical analysis is presented to reveal factors influencing the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm. Specially, a convergence speed optimization method is developed to reduce the iterations, including communication network (CN) topology designing, edge weights optimization, and leader selecting. The performance of the optimization method is demonstrated through several simulation cases.",

This is RISC architecture and these technics can be more or less used for optimization of other audio and video codecs on different RISC architectures. In this work use of instructions from DSP extensions for optimization is not described although these extensions are supported by 74K MIPS32R2 architecture.",

In other words, given an invalid implication of the form A => B, abduction asks the question \"What formula C do we need to conjoin with the antecedent A so that (i) A & C => B is logically valid and (ii) C is consistent with A?\" Abductive reasoning has found many applications in program verification and synthesis, particularly in modular program analysis, invariant generation, and automated inference of missing program expressions. This tutorial will give an overview of logical abduction and algorithms for performing abductive inference. We will also survey several use cases of abductive inference in the context of program analysis, verification, and synthesis.",

In order to improve the high frequency ripple suppression capacity, in this paper, we propose a topology of the LCL filter paralleling to the grid side, and SVPWM tracking control algorithm is used to improve the tracking performance of active power filter. By constructing Lyapunov function, the stability of the LCL in parallel active power filter is analyzed, and the simulation and experimental results show that APF using LCL as output filter, can suppress the high frequency ripple, and the supperession effect can be improved.",

The strength of the PSO algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization, PSO) is its strong global optimization ability, but its local optimization ability is relatively weak. The SQP algorithm (Sequential Quadratic Programming, SQP) is quite the opposite, and it has high requirements of the initial trajectory. So we propose a hybrid optimization algorithm of PSO and SQP which combine the advantages of PSO and SQP, while improving the quality of the optimal trajectory.",

Integrated Circuits (ICs) are designed and fabricated in a globalized multi-vendor environment making them vulnerable to malicious design changes and the insertion of hardware Trojans/malware. In this talk I will cover two distinct techniques to address the problem of detecting hardware Trojans. The first uses SAT and BDD-based functional analysis to reverse engineer ICs. The goal here is to derive the higher-level function of IC through algorithmic analysis of its netlist to help expose the Trojan logic. The second uses statistical analysis of chip simulation data in a clustering algorithm to isolate the Trojan logic. I will discuss these techniques, their practical application on benchmark circuits and their complementary strengths. This is joint work with Burcin Cakir and Pramod Subramanyan.",

        "abstract": "Degradation of the dynamic on-state resistance RON of GaN High-Electron-Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) is commonly observed under switching conditions with high drain current, high blocking voltage and high switching frequency. In order to determine this on-state resistance, specific measurement methods need to be developed. Since the drain source voltage of the device changes between hundreds of volts in the off-state and a few mill-volts in the on-state, an accurate determination of the on-state voltage VDSON is not achievable with standard measurement equipment due to the saturation of the DSO's input channel. In this paper, a voltage clamping circuit used to extract the dynamic on-state resistance RON of GaN HEMTs is presented. This method is based on a high-voltage, fast-switching zero recovery SiC Schottky diode. The circuit allows an accurate measurement of RON from 100 ns after turn-on to any arbitrary time and is feasible for operation at high switching frequencies up to 1MHz. Experimentally, the dynamic on-state resistance of 600V normally-off GaN HEMTs is investigated applying this method.",

Intelligent analysis of a large volume of online CRs attracts interest from researchers in different fields. However, many research studies only concern sentiment polarity in different level and designers still need to read these reviews to absorb comprehensive CRs. In this research, online reviews are analyzed to obtain consumers' fine-grained concerns. Specifically, aspects of product features and detailed reasons of consumers are extracted from online reviews. This research starts from the identification of product features and the sentiment analysis with the help of pros and cons reviews. Next, the approach of conditional random fields is employed to detect aspects of product features and detailed reasons jointly. In addition, a co-clustering algorithm is devised to group similar aspects and reasons to provide concise descriptions about CRs. Finally, with hundreds of customer reviews of six mobiles in Amazon.com, a case study is presented to illustrate how the proposed approaches benefit product designers in the elicitation of CRs by the analysis of online opinion data.",

To achieve global tracking with guaranteed transient performance, a control strategy consisting of supervisory control and neural adaptive control is proposed. The supervisory sliding mode controller ensures that system states enter into a compact set exponentially and remain thereafter, and thereafter, the neural controller based on prescribed performance bound (PPB) is switched in. The global stability of system is proved by Lyapunov-based methodology. Simulation studies clarify and verify the approach.",

Using heterogeneous networks (HetNets) is one possible way of improving energy and spectral efficiency in cellular networks. In this paper, under a coverage constraint, we consider deploying strategies of low power microcells in order to improve the energy and area spectral efficiencies of the conventional macrocell only cellular network. We observe that deploying microcells while keeping the coverage area the same, increases both energy and spectral efficiencies. Finally, we conclude that it is possible to determine a range of inter site distance (ISD) that maximizes the energy efficiency while providing the required traffic demand.",

There have been several incidents in the past where wireless transmission systems were affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI). [1] reports cases where police radios and wireless car lock systems were disrupted by exposure to intentional or unintentional EMI. Therefore the implied reliability of these systems has to be rethought. Understanding the exact mechanisms of wireless data link distortion is crucial for identifying weak points and taking the appropriate counter measures to maintain reliable operation. Within this paper a typical wireless system setup is being analysed its susceptibility to EMI in mind.",

        "abstract": "In medium and high voltage application, NPC topology has been widely investigated concerning the modulation strategies and control methods. Meanwhile, the open winding configuration is gaining the increasing attention in large power drive field. The semi-controlled open winding PMSG system with the integration of three-level full controlled voltage source converter (VSC) and uncontrolled diode converter will be investigated in this paper. The proposed semi-controlled open winding PMSG system has less switch losses, simpler system configuration and still inherits the advantage of traditional open-winding configuration such as the multilevel modulation effect. Based on the mathematical model of the semi-controlled open winding PMSG system, the control scheme is proposed, which is based on the vector control with rotor flux orientation. Finally, a simulation is built to validate the theoretical investigation on the open winding PMSG system.",

        "abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to evaluate alternative DC power flow control strategies applied to Multi-Terminal HVDC (MTDC) grids comprising island systems with high Renewable Energy Source (RES) penetration. A statistical assessment is first performed by calculating the expected steady-state DC voltage and power flow variations of the MTDC grid, induced by stochastic variations of the imported or exported power of each island system. The control strategies applied to the onshore converter controllers comprise predefined voltage - power regulation characteristics, which do not rely on communication infrastructure, such as droop control, voltage margin control, as well as droop control with dead-band. Further, a dynamic model is introduced for the MTDC grid in order to investigate its dynamic behaviour in outage conditions, i.e. following the sudden loss of an onshore converter. For this purpose, suitable control schemes are proposed for the island converters, capable of handling the power imbalance of the MTDC grid.",

But due to the near vicinity of the different systems influences can occur. This paper describes the induced voltages on HVDC systems. These will be determined with a decoupled method for inductive and capacitive coupling of different tower structures to get a first impression of the magnitude of the induced voltages. Also the influence of transposition for double circuit lines was taken into account. To determine the influence of both couplings a distributed line model was applied and a transmission corridor consisting of different tower structures was investigated considering varying load flow directions for the AC Systems.",

In this paper the topology and basic control strategy of hybrid HVDC are described. Then the power reversal of hybrid HVDC is analysed. For LCC-HMMC (MMC adopting half bridge sub-module), the sequence of power reversal after stopping operation is proposed while for LCC-FMMC (MMC adopting full bridge sub-module), a new modulation strategy is proposed to maintain the sub-module voltage during the power reversal without blocking the converters.

This paper considers the design problem of orthogonal phase-modulated waveform set with low autoand cross-correlation side-lobes in a specified lag interval. After formulating a multi-dimensional optimization problem, we propose a new iterative approach that based on the pattern search (PS) method. Capabilities of the PS algorithm and the WeCAN are evaluated via numerical simulations. Simulation results indicate that the new method has better performance with respect to the side-lobe level in the specified lag interval and less computation load compared to the WeCAN algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, multiple flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) supplementary damping controllers are designed for the enhancement of system small-signal stability under different system operating points. A static var compensator (SVC) and a thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC) damping controller are designed sequentially with minimized decoupling effort. This approach is carried out with a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI)-based multi-objective multi-model method. In each step, a single input and single output feedback controller is designed to increase system damping ratios of several inter-area oscillatory modes under nominal and off-nominal operating points. Regional pole placement and control effort optimization are set as the control objectives. Controller designs are implemented on a five-area 68-bus system and the test system is verified by non-linear simulations in real-time digital simulator (RTDS).",

This paper introduces a transfer-matrix-based modeling method for power-system stability analysis. The method has previously been applied for studying the dynamic interaction between voltage-source converters and ac systems. In this paper, the modeling method is used to analyze some conventional power-system stability issues. It is demonstrated that the proposed modeling method gives a new interpretation of conventional power-system stability from a feedback-control point of view. The poles and zeros of the so-called Jacobian transfer matrix (JTM) are useful for understanding the properties of ac/dc systems.",

        "abstract": "Support Vector Machines (SVM) are considered to be good machine learning models for classification and regression analysis. However its training time is comparatively higher, especially when the dataset is large. This paper proposes a novel method QRESVM, that reduces the training time, using QR decomposition (QRD) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) without affecting the classification accuracy. The experimental results indicate that our approach has good classification accuracy with significantly smaller training time.",

The graph topology is associated with a selected multi-agent system, with each agent corresponding to one vertex. In order to reveal the cluster structure, the agents belonging to a similar cluster are expected to aggregate together. As theoretical foundation, a necessary and sufficient condition is proposed to check the group consensus. A numerical instance is shown to illustrate the computation process.",

Contrary to the frequency in an AC power system, the DC voltage cannot be assumed to be the same throughout the system, since a DC voltage difference is necessary to have a current flow. To operate HVDC grids as far as possible from DC voltage stability limits, the selection of the DC reference voltage and DC reference node are crucial factors. This paper introduces a method to find the optimal DC voltage in a HVDC grid based on power flow and line resistances. The method is implemented in the open-source software MatACDC and the results are verified by dynamic simulations in DIgSILENT, using a one area DC voltage restoration controller.",

Adaptive positioning task can be performed by the computations at fusion center using spatial spectrum information-angle of arrival (AOA) and range estimates of fixed stations from the mobile station, and spectrum sensing task can be consummated by utilizing the temporal spectrum information. These objectives are attained by modeling input data as two-dimensional (2 -D) quarter plane causal autoregressive moving average (ARMA), using a multichannel characterization for 2 -D input data, and then extending adaptive multichannel sequential lattice prediction filtering method for spectrum estimation in subbands to 2 -D input data case. The 2 -D spectral estimation performance is visually presented under additive white and colored noise as well as nonstationary conditions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a generalized electromagnetic (EM) wave penetrating propagation model is presented to improve the imaging quality for through-the-wall radar with compressed sensing (CS) technique,. Compared with those penetrating propagation models established only in the 2-D space, the proposed model considers the propagation path in the 3-D space to reduce the mismatch error between the observation model used in CS and the physical procedure. The EW wave propagation path is calculated with an analytical expression with some approximation for stand-off sensing, which is computationally efficient for CS imaging. Real data are used to validate the model proposed. It is shown that the CS imaging with the model proposed can yield better performance in locating and clutter suppression.",

The OCDMA system performance is limited by multiple access interference (MAI) due to asynchronous nature of transmission. This paper discuss an MAI cancellation technique for OCDMA system by incorporating M-ary-FSK Modulation and also by employing double padded modified prime code as a signature sequence. The FSK-OCDMA system performance is compared with the existing pulse position modulation (PPM)-OCDMA system. The results reveal that the FSK-OCDMA system achieve better MAI cancellation by providing lower bit error rate than the PPM-OCDMA system.",

        "abstract": "The past decade has seen VSC-HVDC systems deployed to establish transmission schemes both onshore and offshore, often for interconnectors utilizing underground or subsea cables but also a few systems designed to operate on long overhead transmission lines (OHTLs) [1]. In specific literature, it is referred to the capability of VSC schemes being able to feed power into passive AC grids, hence with a short-circuit capacity equal to zero. However, for proper AC grid operation, there are constraints and power transmission limitations, which come inherently from the physical nature of the AC systems on the receiving and sending ends of the power interconnector, related to their capability to keep stable operating voltage. This paper intends to examine this aspect in order to shed some light on the issue of power transmission limitations for VSC HVDC interconnectors as a function of AC grid characteristics.",

In this context, the service-oriented architecture as well as agents are often proposed. Agent technologies have been studied intensively in academia within the last decades and applications are recently available successfully to the production domain. The applicability of agent technology and smart data for realizing CPPS with real time and dependability requirements is discussed and shown based on selected scenarios. The talk concludes with opportunities and open research issues that need to be faced in order to achieve CPPSs in the context of Industry 4.0.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the characterization of Full SiC MOSFET phase leg modules and compares the performance of \"SiC MOSFET only\" and SiC MOSFETs with SiC Schottky Barrier (SBD) parallel diodes. SiC MOSFET exhibit body diodes that feature a reverse recovery behavior almost as good as true parallel SiC SBDs even if reverse recovery time and recovery energy is a little higher and show some slight dependency on temperature. But this body diode presents significantly high VF. This VF becomes higher as the gate voltage become more negative. In this case it makes great sense implementing external SiC parallel diodes to lower the losses in reverse conduction and transfer those diode conduction losses from the SiC MOSFET body diode to the SiC diode. Biasing the SiC MOSFET with a positive gate voltage helps eliminating the need for parallel SiC diode in the third quadrant of operation.This paper will detail the performance of those SiC MOSFET phase leg options at different temperatures, gate voltages over the full range of current to help system designers optimize the use of SiC MOSFETs and carefully determine the need for parallel SiC SBDs.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on the behaviour of the cell capacitor discharge currents during DC faults in half-bridge modular multilevel converters. Active switches, not designed for fault conditions, are tripped to minimize discharge currents effect on the semiconductor switches. Two levels of device protection are commonly in place; driver level protection monitoring collector-emitter voltage and overcurrent protection with feedback measurement and control. However, unavoidable tripping delay times, arising from factors such as sensor lags, controller sampling delays and hardware propagation delays, impact transient current shape and hence affect the selection of semiconductor device ratings as well as arm inductance. Analytical expressions are obtained for current slew rate, peak transient current and resultant I2t for the cell capacitor discharge current taking into account such delays. The study is backed by experimental testing on discharge of a 900V MMC capacitor.",

In this paper, real-time crowd anomaly detection algorithms have been investigated. Based on the spatio-temporal video volume concept, an innovative spatio-temporal texture model has been proposed in this research for its rich crowd pattern characteristics. Through extracting and integrating those crowd textures from surveillance recordings, a redundancy wavelet transformation-based feature space can be deployed for behavioural template matching. Experiment shows that the abnormality appearing in crowd scenes can be identified in a real-time fashion by the devised method. This new approach is envisaged to facilitate a wide spectrum of crowd analysis applications through automating current Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV)-based surveillance systems.",

        "abstract": "HVDC grids have been made practical with the introduction of Voltage Source Converters (VSC). The development of VSC technology has, and continues to be rapid, with new converter topologies and new manufacturers entering the market. For the power transmission industry to fully exploit the benefits of this rapidly developing field of engineering a \"multi-vendor\" supply chain is considered essential. However, unlike AC grids, there is at present no standardized Grid Code for HVDC grids and interoperability of equipment and systems, purchased from many different and competing suppliers, is a major concern. Compatibility of control between converters supplied by different manufacturers has been considered by different groups. The initial findings were that there was little reason to suggest that restrictions should be placed on which control strategy should be employed. However recent work undertaken by Cardiff University, on behalf of Alstom Grid, uncovered an adverse interaction between converters with differing operating modes. Using results taken from the studies, this paper illustrates how multiple operating points in the control characteristics could occur and show why such operation is undesirable.",

        "abstract": "The solution to nonlinear equations is required in passive radar positioning. However, when the traditional Newton method is adopted, Newton direction may not exist since Jacobian matrix of the equations may be singular. Although the quasi-Newton algorithm overcomes the singular problems, it confronts the common problem of converging to a local optimum value instead of the global optimum value. In this paper, we introduce two quasi-Newton algorithms, namely Spectral Approach for Nonlinear Equations (SANE) and Nonmonotone Spectral for Nonlinear Equations (NMSGNE), to solve this problem. The effectiveness of the proposed target location algorithms is verified via simulation.",

We verify that the strategy based on forcing all the four PAMs to operate at the same bit error rate (BER) - the “same-BER” strategy - besides being the easiest to be implemented enables back-to-back performances only slightly sub-optimal with respect to the strategy that minimizes the overall Flex-PAM signal-to-noise ratio, given the target BER. We also show how nonlinear propagation performances of a WDM comb of Flex-PAM channels can be optimized operating on the power ratio between the four PAM constellations.",

Thermal simulations were used to optimize the system. The performance was verified by measurements on an automotive inverter system with dual side cooled IGBT modules. The advantages of dual-sided cooling are demonstrated in this paper.",

First, the eigenvectors of the spatial covariance matrix is sorted according to the descending order of the eigenvalues. Then, the modified spatial spectrum of each eigenvector is estimated in turn based on the projection features and orthogonal features. Finally, whether there is a signal source or not is judged by the ratio of the maximum value of the spatial spectrum to the mean value of the sidelobes, and the DOA of the signal is obtained by the angle corresponding to the maximum value. The method does not require the angle information of strong interferences. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "One of the key tenets of SDN followed by the Open Networking Foundation is the abstraction of network behavior. This has enabled the separation of forwarding and control and led to faster innovation in both the forwarding plane and the control plane. In our work on optical transport, we have demonstrated common control for packet and optical switching, as well as application access to network topology and control. In this talk, we will describe ONF's SDN architectural view of the network in general and optical transport in particular and explain the extensions to OpenFlow that instantiate SDN for optical transport along with the requirements they satisfy.",

The source-relay, relay-destination and source destination links are modeled as Nakagami-m distributed random variables. In order to decrease performance degradation due to error propagations in DF based wireless cooperative networks and increase the error performance of the system, virtual noise (VN), MRC and cooperative-MRC based detection techniques with the optimal threshold value are considered. Optimum threshold value functions of the considered techniques are derived theoretically.",

With introduction of the state of health of battery in this model, the aging process of the storage system is measured. In addition, an improved differential evolution algorithm is proposed which uses the group fitness variance as parameter adjustment indicator and is applied to solve the optimization problem of the DC microgrid system model. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed energy management method, simulations are conducted with results showing that the proposed energy management model can reduce the operation cost caused by the aging of batteries and correct in advance the foreseeable power fluctuations, thus meets the requirement of stably and economically operation of the DC microgrid.",

This study is useful for bistatic radar identification of wobbling targets.",

By designing the feedforward controller in smaller norm, not only the nonlinear system with nominal plant but also that with perturbed plant can be stabilized, moreover, the plant output can be proved to be closer to the reference output. The effectiveness of the proposed is confirmed by the simulation results.",

By further improvement of the chip characteristics and the development of new high reliability package materials and technologies, the performance of the modules were significantly improved. Additionally, the maximum operating temperature was even increased to up to 175deg C. The new 7th generation IGBT module realized further downsizing and higher efficiency of power conversion systems.",

These radiation sources are cosmic rays and radioactive impurities, able to corrupt the content of memory cells or to induce transient pulses in combinational logic. The growing sensitivity is due to the lower charge needed to define the logic levels in nano-scale semiconductor technologies and the increasing number of components inside the modern integrated circuits. We discuss the sources and mechanisms of single event effects (SEE) and advanced techniques to simulate, analyze, and mitigate these effects, including redundancy and layout-based radiation-hardening-by-design (RHBD).",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a unique design based on flash type ADCs having a high resolution. A novel cyclic architecture concept has been proposed for its implementation. The most important feature of this ADC is that two reference voltages are employed along with flash ADC logic. An 8 bit conventional flash type ADC requires 255 comparators for its implementation. Following this, a 4 bit flash type ADC requires 15 comparators. But the proposed model employs only three comparators to realize an 8 bit resolution in only four clock cycles. The design is verified in hardware and also simulated in MATLAB SIMULINK software. Relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed with respect to the conventional flash and SAR type ADCs.",

        "abstract": "Single unit action potentials that are found in extracellular neural recordings are often detected using a threshold. The threshold is usually computed as proportional to the standard deviation of the entire recording. Such thresholds increase with firing rate. Here, the firing rate dependence of “truncation thresholds”, which are thresholds that are computed using a different approach, is investigated through simulation. Simulated data are constructed using extracellular recordings from cortical area M1 of awake behaving rats. The findings show that, unlike other thresholds, truncation thresholds decrease in absolute value with firing rate. In this way, the value of these thresholds adapts to weed out the noise depending on the firing rate. The results show that truncation thresholds are better than the alternatives considered here at determining the noise component in extracellular recordings.",

Such nodes are characterized by tough requirements in terms of low energy consumption, absolute robustness and secure communication. This talk will focus on the design of low-energy and low-cost integrated sensor interface circuits. The fundamental limitations of both voltage-based and time-based solutions will be discussed and compared, and new architectures will be introduced that convert sensor signals directly into digital output for both capacitive and resistive sensors. Practical design examples will illustrate the design solutions.",

The structure is an arrangement of full-bridge converters based on the three-state switching cell (3SSC) which provides insulation through a medium frequency transformer (MFT). Power flow is controlled by the phase-shift angle between the primary voltage and secondary voltage across the MFT. The basic description of the topology and simulation results are presented, as well as an estimation of losses regarding the semiconductor elements in a comparative study with other topologies applied in traction transportation.",

The dynamic inversion velocity controller and the dynamic surface attitude controller are proposed, the difficulty caused by the input nonlinear has been overcome. The uncertain nonlinear functions in the flight vehicle model are approximated by neural networks. Moreover, only one parameter needs to be updated online at each step, the computation burden and the explosion of complexity are greatly reduced. It is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

Our method uses a force sensitive resistor to calibrate the force of a power grip as a function of the area and light intensity. This research is work in progress but results so far augur well for its applicability in medical and other application areas. The grip measurement device allows the patient and doctor to see the change in grip over time and projects this information directly onto the back of the patient's hand.",

        "abstract": "Chaotic communication has become research hotspot in recent years. But in high speed data transmission communication, due to the restriction of chaos synchronization, its communicating effect is not superior to the traditional methods (such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying). In this paper a novel spatiotemporal chaos Hamilton oscillator is discussed in detail, and a new chaos M-ary digital modulation and demodulation method based on Hamilton oscillator is proposed. By using region controllable characteristics of chaos Hamilton oscillator in phase plane and chaos unique characteristic, which is sensitive to initial value, zone mapping method is proposed. Thus the M-ary information chaos modulation is realized. In addition, zone partition demodulation method is proposed based on the structure characteristic of Hamilton modulated information. Finally the communication system based on the two methods is constructed on the computer. The simulation shows that in high speed transmission communications and with no chaos synchronization circumstance, the proposed chaos M-ary modulation and demodulation method has outperformed some conventional M-ary modulation methods, such as QPSK in bit error rate. Besides, it has performance improvement in bandwidth efficiency, transmission efficiency and anti-noise performance, and the system complexity is low and chaos signal is easy to be generated.",

The relative models are established based on C-W equation. To apply the proposed gain scheduling approaches, only a scalar nonlinearity equation is required to be solved. Especially, the simulations have carried out directly on the nonlinearity model of the spacecraft rendezvous instead of a linearized one show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "When an HVDC system is subjected to AC side short circuit faults, the transformer core might be driven to saturation at fault recovery due to flux offset. The saturation will therefore cause the flow of inrush currents. In this paper, dynamic models of a MMC based VSC-HVDC system incorporating transformer magnetisation characteristics are derived and verified. Using disturbance sensitivity functions, the impact of attenuation of inrush currents due to different locations of current sensors (of inner current controller) is investigated. It is shown that placing the current sensor at the converter side of the transformer enable the inrush currents to attenuate faster and prevents the converter from overcurrent exposure, allowing it to more successfully ride-through faults.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an efficient concealed weapon detection (CWD) algorithm based on image fusion is presented. First, the images obtained using different sensors are decomposed into low and high frequency bands with the double-density dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DDDTCWT). Then two novel decision methods are introduced referring to the characteristics of the frequency bands, which significantly improves the image fusion performance for CWD application. The fusion of low frequency bands coefficients is determined by the local contrast, while the high frequency band fusion rule is developed by considering both the texture feature of the human visual system (HVS) and the local energy basis. Finally, the fused image is obtained through the inverse DDDTCWT. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach and indicate that the fusion rules can be applied to different multiscale transforms. Also, our work shows that the fusion result using the proposed fusion rules on DDDTCWT is superior to other combinations as well as previously proposed approaches.",

The current sharing between modules is critical for the system performance and reliability. A hybrid control system is designed and tested to achieve good current sharing in a large array system as well as accurate output voltage control. Load regulation and temperature compensation has been designed for proper output current sharing between modules. After that, an analog feedback loop in the system level can be used to improve the array output voltage accuracy if needed. Experimental test has been performed to validate this control system successfully.",

This governance model consists of an adaptive device built around a differentiation of smart sensors and tags to improve human decision-making. More specifically, this device is based on taking into account both, by a normative approach, \"physical sensors\", and, by a positive approach, \"economic and social sensors\". Thus, this model is a guidance for the city governance by introducing decision criteria beyond the simple technical requirements. This mechanism design is based on the attempt to capture the explicit or implicit needs in the form of \"weak signals\", or their consequences. It should capture the diverted actions from the objectives pursued by the \"decision maker\". Thus, a \"regulation\" of the system becomes possible. Therefore, the Asset management planning of Buildings and Urban infrastructures benefit of a better \"alignment\" for consistency with the economic and social.",

In the realized drive unit, each stator coil of the motor has its own power electronics and control module. Coil, power electronics and control module are combined in a smart stator tooth (SST). This SST-approach provides advantages in functionality, installation space, weight and interfaces. Furthermore, the SST improves system availability and safety, which is very important in vehicle applications. The paper discusses the behavior of the SST system for certain important failure cases. A finite elements simulation of motor currents and torques shows, that the system is fail-operational.",

This problem is important and has lots of applications because it can describe approximations of a wide variety of nonlinear systems. In this paper, the SARX identification problem is formulated as a kind of matrix rank minimization problem, and a practical algorithm is proposed based on the iterative partial matrix shrinkage (IPMS) algorithm. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm identifies SARX systems effectively.",

The unified power flow approach is extended to include DC voltage droop control. In the VSC based MTDC grids, DC droop control is regarded as more advantageous in terms of operational flexibility, as more than one VSC station controls the DC link voltage of the MTDC system. This model enables the study of the effects of DC droop control on the power flows of the combined AC/DC system for steady state studies after VSC station outages or transient conditions without needing to use its complete dynamic model. Further, the proposed approach can be extended to include multiple AC and DC grids for combined AC/DC power flow analysis. The algorithm is implemented by modifying the MATPOWER based MATACDC program and the results shows that the algorithm works efficiently.",

        "abstract": "Traditional ac distribution network is ushering a new era of transformation toward dc, providing significant solution to its insufficient current carrying capacity, increasing fault currents, poor power quality, difficulty in flexible integration of large-scale renewable energy sources, etc. To address these issues this paper intends to open up an overview of the dc distribution network trends and present technical superiority analysis for multi-terminal dc (MTDC) distribution network. On this basis, MTDC distribution architectures based on voltage sourced converter (VSC) have been proposed and applied with reliability and controllability under consideration, such as hand-in-hand topology, dual-ring topology, half-ring topology and radial-type topology. Furthermore, performance of MTDC distribution networks is discussed and theoretically validated: high voltage stability, short recovery time, large power capacity, flexible power flow controllability, high power quality, plug-and-play functionality for dispersed renewable sources, etc. Besides, two kinds of control schemes with central control or not are discussed and energy optimization of MTDC network is focused. Last of the paper discusses current DC distribution projects and projects under construction. To sum up, MTDC distribution networks are superior to its ac counterpart, while many technical and practical problems remain unsolved.",

However, the stability and robustness of such a closed-loop droop controlled system have not been addressed in detail. In this paper, analytical models capturing the key dynamics of the droop dc voltage loop are presented. Transient performance and stability margins of such models are assessed utilising frequency-response techniques. The effect of operating point, ac system strength, and other control loop designs are examined. Design considerations for the droop controller are also indicated by frequency-domain analysis. A more advanced compensator-based droop controller is introduced to enhance robust stability without degrading performance.",

Each follower node is modeled by a higher-order nonlinear systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics and an unknown disturbance. The leader node is also a higher-order nonlinear system. Only a part of the networked group has access to the information of the leader. And a distributed robust consensus controller is designed to ensure all the follower nodes synchronize to the trajectory of the leader node exponentially. Meanwhile, a smooth and time-varying sliding mode controller is presented to eliminate chattering phenomenon. The stability of the proposed methods is proved rigorously. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

Yet over 40 years later there is still no operational SSP due to the economics and associated risks, public awareness, political agendas and from lack of demonstrations to these audiences.",

In this system, we chose an image without foreground target as the background image. To reduce the interference, updating the background in real-time is a must, and the foreground image is got by the improved Gaussian background difference between current image and background image, then binarizing and morphology processing. After dilating and eroding, the contours of people are clearly presented. We take the contour as a person if the number of the pixels in the contour is more than a certain threshold, and the number of the contours is the number of people. In the end, we utilize the ratio of width to height of the contours to improve the accuracy.",

A semi-supervised affinity propagation clustering algorithm based on kernel function (K-SAP Clustering Algorithm) is proposed in this paper. This algorithm first maps the complex clustering space into the feature space and change the similarity measure by a kernel function. Then semi-supervised algorithm is used to adjust the similarity matrix to be neighbours of data in same cluster. Finally, AP algorithm is used to iterate and undate to get the global optimum. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm is better and more accurate than SAP algorithm for complex data sets clustering.",

A high bandwidth, low additional stray inductance and an easy use of the sensor are the main advantages of this current measurement technique. For applications which necessitate the use of current sensors with a large number of windings (e.g. Rogowski coils), the bandwidth of these sensors decreases due to the higher internal inductance. This paper presents three approaches to improve the performance of inductive current sensors by using additional external components or mathematic corrections.

        "abstract": "Scalar non-uniform Lloyd-Max quantization (LMQ) is optimized for the minimum mean squared error satisfying the centroid condition, stating that the reconstruction level is the centroid of the area of the signal probability density function (PDF) in the respective quantization interval. For a given signal PDF, reconstruction levels are therefore time-invariant. Without predictive means at the encoder, scalar LMQ does not exploit source correlation at all. With the purpose of improving LMQ performance for correlated processes, we propose a novel scalar decoding approach employing a receiver-sided predictor inside a feedback loop. Based on the standard LMQ decision levels and utilizing the prediction error PDF shifted by the predictor output, a receiver-sided time-variant quantization codebook can be generated according to the centroid condition. Moreover, we give an analytical derivation of the variance of the prediction error. Simulations over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel in error-free and error-prone transmission conditions show that the proposed approach outperforms the standard LMQ by about 1.0 dB in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially for low rate quantization and highly correlated source processes.",

The preferred measurement technique to characterize saturation behavior is small-signal inductance versus dc-bias. We recently presented a new method for simulating small signal inductance versus dc-bias currents [1, 2]. By using the proper material characteristics, this method allows the simulation of saturation effects due to differential mode and common mode currents. The simulation results are verified by measurements on a standard and a novel Common Mode Choke design under development.",

Hitachi's latest package technology development is the new high voltage package concept named \"next High Power Density Dual (nHPD2)\". The package offers not only a drastic reduction in the internal inductance by 75% from conventional modules, but also an increase in the power density compared with the latest F-version series modules. Hitachi formerly presented the latest generation F-series modules in 2014, showing a 20% higher power density compared to conventional devices in the market. nHPD2 provides even higher power densities, up to 10% more. The developed package is equipped with a current sensing function which enables the user to detect the voltage difference using the internal package inductance. Although it is challenging to apply the current sensing method using the internal inductance with high accuracy in spite of the extremely low inductance module, in this paper we propose a new current sensing algorism using the internal inductance and verified to show adequate accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a voltage control for an offshore load fed by a Multi-Terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system (MTHVDC). The studied system is composed by two GSCs (Grid Side Converters) and one OSC (Offshore Side Converter). The objective is to maintain the amplitude and frequency of the AC voltage constant at the offshore terminal with a minimum overshoot. A vector control strategy including a current control loop and a voltage control loop is proposed for the OSC and also LQG (Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian) compensator is employed to improve the voltage response of offshore load. The performance of this controller is validated using simulation in MATLAB/SIMULINK software for three operating conditions: normal operation, no-load and start-up of the offshore load. Simulation results illustrate that the AC voltage of load can be governed at its nominal value and MT-HVDC system linked to the offshore load with the proposed controller is able to provide a reliable dynamic operation and a desirable voltage quality during load variations.",

        "abstract": "To deal with the contradictions between camera field of view and resolution in visual observation, a collaborative observation algorithm for multiple moving targets using a Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera assisted by a wide-angle camera is designed. Firstly, the low resolution images are captured by the wide-angle camera, based on that multiple moving targets are detected, tracked and predicted. Then, for the multiple observation requested generated from the multiple targets, a visual tracking algorithm for the PTZ camera is developed. The factors, such as the image resolution, vision coverage range and response to tracking requests, are taken into account in the algorithm, and the desired pose of the PTZ camera is worked out optimally. Finally, the vehicle tracking experiments both in a simulated airport and actual traffic scenes are carried out, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in this paper is accurate and time-efficient.",

Realization of ship detection in SAR harbor images accurately and efficiently is a hot topic nowadays. The complexity of the inner harbor and the uncertainty of target types make it difficult to achieve effective ship target detection of harbor SAR images and the detection procedure is complicated. The paper analyzes the procedure of ship detection of the inner harbor SAR images, utilizes the gradient based level sets evolution method to extract the coastline, then detects ship target in the ROI inner harbor. The experiment certifies an effective result of ship target detection.",
