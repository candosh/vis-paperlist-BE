While most attribute learning methods are supervised by costly human-generated labels, we introduce a simple yet powerful unsupervised approach to learn and predict visual attributes directly from data. Given a large unlabeled image collection as input, we train deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to output a set of discriminative, binary attributes often with semantic meanings. Specifically, we first train a CNN coupled with unsupervised discriminative clustering, and then use the cluster membership as a soft supervision to discover shared attributes from the clusters while maximizing their separability. The learned attributes are shown to be capable of encoding rich imagery properties from both natural images and contour patches. The visual representations learned in this way are also transferrable to other tasks such as object detection. We show other convincing results on the related tasks of image retrieval and classification, and contour detection."

Rechargeable batteries have widely varying efficiencies, charging characteristics, life cycles, and costs. This paper compares these aspects between the lead-acid and lithium ion battery, the two primary options for stationary energy storage. The various properties and characteristics are summarized specifically for the valve regulated lead-acid battery (VRLA) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) lithium ion battery. The charging process, efficiency, and life cycle are discussed for each battery type. Through cost analysis specifically, lithium ion batteries are shown to be a cost-effective alternative to lead-acid batteries when the length of operational life - total number of charge/discharge cycles - is considered. Finally, applications for off-grid applications and specifically developing world microgrids are discussed."

Existing tools and techniques do not allow one to verify directly these properties, expressed as behavioral equivalences. We propose a different approach: we design two conditions on protocols which are sufficient to ensure anonymity and unlinkability, and which can then be effectively checked automatically using ProVerif. Our two conditions correspond to two broad classes of attacks on unlinkability, corresponding to data and control-flow leaks. This theoretical result is general enough to apply to a wide class of protocols. In particular, we apply our techniques to provide the first formal security proof of the BAC protocol (e-passport). Our work has also lead to the discovery of new attacks, including one on the LAK protocol (RFID authentication) which was previously claimed to be unlinkable (in a weak sense) and one on the PACE protocol (e-passport)."

Several experimental results have proven to the effectiveness and performance of BA. However, BA may fail to find the global optimal solution occasionally. In this paper, a kind of classical search technology, called variable neighborhood search (VNS), is incorporated into BA as a local search tool. An improved version of BA namely variable neighborhood bat algorithm (VNBA), is thus proposed. In VNBA, the classic BA as a global search tool searches the whole space globally, and this can significantly shrink the search space. Subsequently, VNS as a local search tool is implemented to find the final best solution within the small promising area. After that, the VNBA is benchmarked by sixteen standard benchmark functions. The experimental results imply that VNBA takes the absolute advantage over the basic BA."

In this work, six forearm movements have been chosen for classification purpose for both left and right hand. With Hilbert Huang Transform method a total of 21 features of time-frequency domain are extracted for 10 healthy subjects and classified using conjugate gradient method of supervised learning technique using artificial neural networks (ANN). The average accuracy at IMF-1 level obtained is 85.8% for left hand movements, and 86.2% for right hand movement classification. The results of using the Hilbert Huang Transform based ANN classification are quite promising when compared to another classification techniques as K-NN, QDA, LDA [21] and Mahdi Khezri et al. different signal acquisition and classification techniques[26].

        "abstract": "Although water, in some parts of the world is as abundant as the air that we breathe, it is still a precious resource in dry regions. Such regions must use it carefully and efficiently because of its scarcity. However, the irrigation systems are still wasteful as they unnecessarily flood the farms. This results into wastage of water and energy that is used for pumping the water. With the improvement of the technological infrastructure, effective management of water usage and power consumption of irrigation systems can be achieved. This can be done by enabling the irrigation system to identify specific areas to irrigate. This paper presents a smart irrigation system that uses environmental information to determine when and where irrigation is required. The system is comprised of microcontroller, sensors and integration of water pumps with the decision making system. A truth table is developed to help the system determine the necessity to irrigate based on the collected environment information. The sensors narrow down the location that requires irrigation and the decision-making system activates sprinklers. In this fashion, water is given to dry locations of the field, already damp locations are not irrigated and this results efficient water use. Different parameters used, i.e. temperature, humidity and moisture, makes it possible to adjust the system according to the needs of a particular location."

        "abstract": "Energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs) have been widely used in various areas in recent years. Unlike battery-powered wireless sensor networks, EH-WSNs are powered by energy harvested from ambience. This change calls for new designs on routing protocols in EH-WSNs. This paper proposes a novel energy-aware distributed clustering routing protocol for EH-WSNs, it takes the node current residual energy and the harvested energy in a short term prediction horizon into cluster heads election process of the distributed clustering routing. A neural network based solar energy prediction model is exploited to make the protocol energy-aware. Nodes with higher residual energy and stronger energy harvesting capabilities thus have higher probability of being cluster heads. The proposed routing algorithm is compared with LEACH (low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) in terms of the number of awake nodes and network throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed clustering routing has stronger ability to balance energy consumption among sensor nodes and increases the network throughput by about 30% over LEACH."

In addition, this research verifies that greenwash is negatively related to both of green brand image and green satisfaction that would positively influence green brand equity. This paper also proves that green brand image and green satisfaction mediate the negative relationship between greenwash and green brand equity. Hence, this study suggests that companies should reduce their greenwash behaviors and raise their green brand image and green satisfaction to enhance their green brand equity."

However, the underlying independent and identically distributed condition of the interference is violated, which induces performance degradation of jamming suppression. In this paper, we propose a robust adaptive beamforming approach based on direct data domain technique for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar with FDA as transmit array, referred to as FDA-MIMO. In this approach, the data is smoothed once in transmit and receive domains to mitigate the influence of target, which results in three homogeneous samples. In the sequel, the data collected from different pulses is utilized as secondary data. Basically, the interference can be isolated from the target signal in the joint transmit and receive domains of the FDA-MIMO radar. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

This scenario is impractical to study developers as they actually work on large software artifacts. To overcome this an Eclipse plugin, iTrace, is introduced that monitors developers eye movements even in the presence of scrolling and file switching within an IDE. In addition, it automatically maps the eye gaze to source code elements. Existing work using iTrace is presented followed by a scenario of how to setup and run an eye tracking study.

A wind turbine model has been implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Fault signature analysis for electrical signals is presented. A signal processing algorithm based on a fast fourier transform is then used to potentially identify fault signatures. The results obtained with this model are validated with experimental data measured from a physical test rig. Through comparison between simulation data and experimental data it is concluded that the power converter has significantly reduced fault signatures from the electrical signal though not entirely extinguished them. It may still be possible to extract some fault information after the converter though this is much more challenging than upstream. Further work is needed to see whether it may be possible to modify the power converter particularly the filter design and the switching elements to avoid removing fault signatures from electrical signals without adding significant cost or compromising performance."

The large-scale DNN with big training data and a diverse set of parameters is facing challenges on insufficient computation power on traditional computing platform. To address these challenges, industry and academia are looking at the approaches for large-scale DNN training and on-line services at algorithms level, system level, and architecture level. We, at Baidu, the largest Internet search company in China, have designed a production-quality PCIe-based FPGA accelerator for large-scale DNN systems. The FPGA DNN accelerator is able to enable efficient large-scale DNN training and on-line services in a low-cost and low-power manner environment."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel continuous multicast authentication protocol for the Internet of Things applications based on secret sharing scheme. This protocol provides secure and efficient multicast authentication for frequent message transmissions in short session time interval. The protocol solves the problem of shared key among communicating group with its consequence of possible masquerade attack by introducing a novel use of secret sharing scheme. That is, the secret is used as an authenticator and its shares are used as authentication keys. Each share is designated to a specific recipient in a specific time through a challenge known only to the sender and that recipient. The share can be linked back to the secret and, hence, the message source can be authenticated. In addition, the protocol enables multicasting several messages in a specific time slots within a transmission session. Security evaluation of the protocol shows that it fulfills the stated security requirements and addresses the listed attacks. Performance evaluation of the protocol shows that it is lightweight in terms of computation and communication costs, thus addressing the resource-constrained IoT endpoints."

The proposed impedance estimation method is derived from the discretised system model using two consecutive samples within the switching period. The estimated impedance is used for islanding detection and online current controller parameter adaptation. Theoretical analysis and MATLAB simulation results are presented to verify the proposed method. The effectiveness of the grid impedance estimator is validated using experimental results."

This is achieved by using a linearized small signal model of the converter system and its controls. The model is validated via electromagnetic transients simulation of the fully detailed large signal model. An interesting result from this study is that the maximum power transfer capability of the VSC-HVdc converter is affected by the PLL gains, and that the theoretical limit (obtained from static voltage stability analysis) is approachable as the PLL gains become very small. This paper shows that gains of the PLL, particularly at low SCRs greatly affect the operation of the VSC-HVdc converter and that operation at low SCRs approaching 1.3 is very difficult."

The strategy ensures the minimum number of HVDC breaker openings and converter block events in response to a DC fault. The proposed strategy is verified by simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC for a three terminal symmetrical monopole radial grid. The paper also presents a reclosing strategy to restore the power after fault clearing."

To organize multi-UAV network one needs to use special routing algorithms developed due to their specific features. The article gives a short overview of the existing FANET algorithms, as well as of the algorithms based on the swarm intelligence (of the ant and bee colonies).

Race conditions exist between the data plane and control plane which increases the packet forwarding delay. This paves the way for switch DOS attack. The race condition is mitigated and switch DOS attack is provented. Evaluuation results show that the performance of the network is enhanced and significantly SDN is prevented from switch Dos attack."

Aggregators could optimally manage the charging/discharging of the EVs, to not only maximize the consumers' welfare in response to real-time prices and accommodate their needs for transportation, but also to keep the distribution network within its operating limits. This paper proposes a decentralized framework in which the aggregator seeks to maximize its profits while the consumers minimize their costs in response to time-varying prices, and additional incentives provided to mitigate potential overloads in the distribution system. Test results show that a large penetration of EV penetration can then be managed without violating the capacity of the distribution network."

In this work we propose new algorithms for multi-agent distributed iterative value function approximation where the agents are allowed to have different behavior policies while evaluating the response to a single target policy. The algorithms assume linear parametrization of the value function and are based on consensus-based distributed stochastic approximation. Under appropriate assumptions on the time-varying network topology and the overall state-visiting distributions of the agents we prove weak convergence of the parameter estimates to the globally optimal point. It is demonstrated that the agents are able to together reach this solution even when the individual agents cannot."

For comparison we are using inbuilt switch application included with these controllers. We tested the performance on python based Mininet Emulator which can be used to create any size custom topology by writing few lines of python code.

We attempted to minimize the segmentation errors by reducing the segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid OCR system for printed Nepali text using the Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning technique. It incorporates two different approaches of OCR - the Holistic and the Character level recognition. The system first tries to recognize word as a whole; if it is not confident about the word being recognized, then the character level recognition is performed. Histogram Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptors are used to define a feature vector of a word or character. The recognition rates of approximately 78.87% and 94.80% are achieved for character level recognition method and the Hybrid method respectively."

Here the network is clustered according to Tnergy-Efficient Distance-based Clustering (EEDC) algorithm. For each cluster head, a set of backup nodes are selected using genetic algorithm based on the sponsored coverage and residual energy parameters. This helps in detecing the faults occurring in cluster heads. Simulation results show that the proposed technique minimizes the energy loss and overhead."

Various MIMO configurations based on Single-User (SU)-MIMO, Multi-User (MU)-MIMO, network-MIMO architectures have been proposed for LTE systems. To accommodate the ever-increasing demands of different multimedia services and applications, the evolving next-generation wireless access networks are envisioned to support 1,000-fold gains in capacity, connections for billions of diverse devices, and Gb/s individual user data rates. Massive MIMO has emerged as a promising technology to deal with such challenges. Through the use of an excessively large number of service antennas in a fully coherent and adaptive operation, transmission and reception of signal energy can be focused into small regions to offer large improvements in throughput and energy efficiency, especially when combined with multi-user scheduling and in mmWave bands. Furthermore, massive MIMO can enhance the robustness to interference and intentional jamming. The talk will provide an overview from MIMO, SU-MIMO, MU-MIMO, network-MIMO to massive MIMO developments applicable to next-generation wireless access communications, and highlight various technical issues and solutions."

This paper proposed a hierarchical structure for the electricity market to facilitate the coordination of energy markets in distribution and transmission networks. The proposed market structure enables the integration of microgrids, which provide energy and ancillary services in distribution networks. In the proposed hierarchical structure, microgrids participate in the energy market at the distribution networks settled by the distribution network operator (DNO), and load aggregators (LAs) interact with microgrids and generation companies (GENCOs) to import/export energy to/from the distribution network electricity markets from/to the wholesale electricity market. The proposed approach addressed the synergy of energy markets by introducing dynamic game with complete information for GENCOs, microgrids, and LAs. The proposed hierarchical competition is composed of bi-level optimization problems in which the respective upper-level problems maximize the individual market participants' payoff, and the lower-level problems represent the market settlement accomplished by the DNO or the independent system operator. The bi-level problems are solved by developing sensitivity functions for market participants' payoff with respect to their bidding strategies. A case study is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Nowadays, the wireless power transmission technology is widely used in the mobile, industrial and medical area. The technology of the wireless power transmission can eliminate the use of the wires and batteries. Thus it is so convenient and safe for all users. Wireless power transmission can be carried out by many methods, but the most common way seen was inductive coupling and resonant coupling which was recently developed. This paper involves the design and development of wireless power transmission hardware. A wireless power system consists of a transmitter (primary coil) and a receiver (secondary coil). An alternating current is passed through the primary coil and a magnetic field was generated. The secondary coil is then placed near to the primary coil. The primary coil and secondary coil are magnetically coupled when the two devices make contact and therefore the power transfer from the transmitter to the receiver. Test and analysis are done on how to develop the wireless electricity transmission through resonant coupling by varying the different wire diameters, number of coils and coil diameters of the primary and secondary of the coils. The output power and maximum distance are then analyzed based on the varying characteristics. As a conclusion, the best result to obtain the maximum output power is 0.55 mm wire with diameter 6.5 cm coil."

In particular, we explore state-of-the-art collective classification (CC) algorithms for predicting consumers' opinion orientations. Based on real-world data collected from Sina Weibo, our experiments show that the proposed Gibbs sampling based CC algorithms which consider both a user's local features and their relational features outperform another approach that considers relational features alone."

And, the second layer, energy management based on context-awareness layer, analyses the data and infers the context from them. Finally, the energy service layer provides energy management services to users through monitoring and controlling the status of energy consumption. Using the proposed scheme, users can monitor their energy consumption, and control their utilities and equipment to avoid energy leakage."

        "abstract": "In modern society, civil plane has become more and more important in people's life. How to ensure safety and reliability of civil plane has attracted more and more attention by many research institutes and researchers. As one of the most important part in the civil plane, how to ensure normal operation of aero-engine becomes particularly important. According to statistics, the sensor fault accounts for more than 80% of the total failures in the aero-engine system. In this paper, an aero-engine model is established according to the operational principle of aero-engine using AMESim software. Secondly, the sensor sub-model in above model is modified to simulate drift failure, bias fault, and pulse fault, and to achieve aero-engine sensors' fault data. After that, sensor fault diagnosis model is built based on principle component analysis. Online detection and diagnosis can be realized using this diagnosis model. Simulation results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective."

The dependency of the avalanche energy versus the applied inductance is studied in detail and the minimum of this characteristic is explained. Robust and weak diode designs are compared. Repetitive avalanche tests at challenging conditions show the robustness of the used MPS design. First studies at SiC MOSFETs show also a comparatively high avalanche capability"

The construction of these domains depends on the specific representation chosen for the power flow equations, so that different representations lead to different domains. Given this domain, there is a simple efficient algorithm that will either find a solution in the domain, or certify that no solutions exist in it. We validate the approach on several IEEE test cases."

Our main purpose is to find OOV words that can be added into the Myanmar dictionary. The outcome of our method are new compound words that do not exist in the Myanmar dictionary. Our method consists of two steps. In the first step, we extract maximal substrings, i.e., the substrings whose number of occurrences are decreased only after appending a character before or after them, from Myanmar news articles. In the second step, we make the post-processing of maximal substrings, because the results obtained by maximal substrings contain noisy characters. Our post-processing is threefold. First, we reduce the number of maximal substrings. Second, we remove maximal substrings whose prefixes and suffixes are meaningless characters. Third, we find OOV words that are the substrings consisting of the two words from the existing dictionary. Consequently, we obtain the substrings as candidates of new compound words that can be inserted into the existing Myanmar dictionary after being scrutinized by native speakers. We evaluate the accuracy of new compound words by using the subjective perspective. It is found that our results do seem promising. We appeal that new compound words obtained by our method are useful for expressing the words as a single unit of meaning that can be utilized in Myanmar text effectively."

Two different scenarios with centralized PV power plants are considered at medium voltage level without voltage regulation capabilities. The simulation results offer details of the simulation investigations which show that voltage stability impact of L-S PV decreases based on the bus status, disturbance location, and disturbance duration.

A square patch is embedded as a parasitic element at the center of the rotating slot to increase the impedance bandwidth. Rectangular slots are cut in the square patch to compensate the return loss. A pair of E-shaped parasitic patches along the 50 ohm microstrip line is used to introduce additional resonance excitation which can enhance the bandwidth. The proposed antenna is successfully manufactured and experimentally investigated. The measured results are in good agreement with the simulation results. The impedance bandwidth is found to be 74.4% ranging from 2.45 GHz to 5.35 GHz.

The registered images are decomposed by the shearlet transform to obtain the low frequency subband and a series of high frequency subbands. The low frequency subband with lower sparseness is disposed with sparse representation, construct over complete dictionary, solve sparse coefficient over the trained dictionary, and choose the low frequency coefficients with the larger energy fusion rule. And the rule of gradient absolute value maximization is applied to the high frequency subbands. Then the fusion image is obtained by the inverse Shearlet transform. Experimental results show that the proposed method can retain good visual quality and objective evaluation index, and performs some related fusion approaches."

        "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) systems can be one of the possible energy sources to complement the diesel generators in the remote areas, to reduce the reliance on diesel generators. This translates into the reduced fossil fuel consumption, hence bringing an economic benefit to residents in the remote areas. Energy storage system offers a solution which can be used in conjunction with the PV-diesel generator system. The energy storage system (ESS) ensures energy supply security and reliability by storing up excess solar energy for later use in the energy deficit situation. In this study, a PV-Battery-Diesel Generator system is modelled in Matlab Simulink. The main purpose of the study is to obtain the optimal system size and control strategy which yields the minimum cost of energy. Load following (LF) and cycle charging (CC) control strategies are devised for the model developed. Various component sizes for PV and battery are simulated using the LF and CC control strategy. The simulation results show that the Cost of Electricity (COE) reduction using the PV-battery-diesel generator is as high as 10.6%."

The distributed generator can improve the power system reliability and reduce losses. The most widely preferred DG which is large attracted by large scale as wind powers do not have pollution issue and consider as clean energy source. By the wind to its maximum extent it is necessary to place the wind turbine at the place where the losses of the system and the size of the turbine are minimum. In this paper the PSO (particle swarm optimization) technique is applied on IEEE 12 radial standard bus system to get reduced losses and optimum size of wind turbine. Backward/forward sweep method used to analyze the power flow in radial distribution systems. Weibull functions F(x) have been used to describe the best wind distribution which is one of the probabilistic modeling to select random variable. From the results optimum size of turbine is obtained and also obtains the location for placement of wind turbine to optimum the system losses. MATLAB/Simulink is used to simulate the optimization of power losses at power output of mean various wind turbine speed."

This contribution is introduced by an overview of factors that influence fault currents in HVDC networks and a comparison to frequently used test currents. In the following, the dimensioning of different circuit breaker topologies is explained using an example fault current. After comparing the interruption performance of selected topologies, the influence of changes in the fault current on the topology dependent interruption behavior is qualitatively discussed. A comparison with currently used test currents indicates, in which areas further investigation is needed."

The authors describe the way to make such bridging. Initial bridge circuit has been selected and the method to change its loop containing balancing elements has been defined, with such method comprising the substitution of the single resistor by a multielement port that is equivalent to the port of the controlled, diagnosed, measured or investigated object. It is proved that such loop in the bridge circuit can provide for the bridge circuit extended functional capability even if it is balanced by varistors only. The paper contains examples of equilibrium conditions in the obtained bridge circuit for two variants of controlled objects that are reverse two-terminal networks. The proposed bridge circuit, like the initial one, belongs to quasibalanced bridges, because voltage spikes, that occur at the onset of the output pulse and at its termination and contain sum-totals of exponential summands fading to the zero within the transient time period, are not reduced to zero."

Silently, but surely, these methods have become a part of every technology consumer's life through their use in applications such as image search, face detection and speech processing. It is widely understood now that deep learning methods use deep graph architectures to learn hierarchical representations of data using linear and non-linear transformations, which are then used for learning and inference. Deep learning architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Autoencoders, Boltzmann Machines, and more recently, improvised networks such as Residual Networks and Memory Networks. These various morphologies of deep learning have displayed immense potential in solving AI problems that have challenged the field over the past few decades, supported by the availability of large amounts of data and computational power.

To satisfy the ever-increasing computing requirements, mobile CPU clock frequencies have exceeded GHz. However, the technology will soon hit a frequency wall beyond which cost becomes prohibitively high. Thus, mobile clients are rapidly moving to multi-core CPU and GPU to enable consumer applications and mobile human-interface devices (HIDs), with system-adaptive power management, thermal throttling, and heterogeneous multi-processing, for optimal performance and energy efficiency within thermal limits. The insatiable computation need, coupled with the explosion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and wearable devices for long battery operation will continue to driver the IC technology forward. But, with the constraints of portable-device form factors and limited battery-technology improvement, the energy and thermal gaps present major technical challenges. To overcome these challenges, many innovations are desperately needed to enable the ubiquitous ecosystem that promises to provide ample possibilities to enhance and enrich everyone's life."

Dance figures obtained by a motion capture system are segmented automatically and analyzed with regard to center of mass to form the dance database. Choreographies are then created by combining compatible primitives and adapting them. The system is tested using both objective metrics such as the accuracy of the motion primitive segmentation as well as the subjective scores about the fluency and quality of the dance patterns, and is proven to be effective."

Although \"they save lives\", these UAVs were still too expensive and inaccessible to civilians. As of 2012, USAF deployed about 7500 UAVs. Starting in the 1990's, research programs were introduced in the robotics community to develop and miniaturize UAV technology for civilian use. Based on this work, a final-year project was done in 2005 at HKUST, aiming to develop a helicopter flight controller. Later, Frank Wang went on to found a UAV company by the name of DJI and introduced the Phantom family, a series of ready-to-fly UAVs equipped with gimbal-stabilized cameras. Combining consumer-level price and good user experience, the Phantom quickly became a popular device among hobbyists, filmmakers, and consumers. A new market for easy-to-fly aerial robotics that anyone could use emerged. Today the Phantoms are widely utilized in aerial photography/filmmaking, agriculture, sports, and infrastructure inspection and more. The drone market in 2015 is expected to break the one million unit benchmark."

Then we can acquire the optimal decision value with maximum profit of manufacturers and retailers by model solution, to improve individual and entire benefit in closed-loop supply chain.

However till now, the processing required for real time face detection prohibits integration of the complete application into a small sized camera. The Real Time Face Tracking and Identification for Surveillance System proposed in this research work has come up with a simple and an efficient approach to satisfy the processing requirements and enable fast and accurate face detection. The core functionality of Real Time Face Tracking and Identification for Surveillance System is to allow tracking and recognition of human faces in a video stream and thereby provide a centralized, cost effective and robust mechanism of securing business and government premises. The primary objective of the proposed system is to reduce detection redundancy, minimize misclassification risk, provide huge processing capacity and work within a reasonable computational budget."

However, manufacturing defects and aging effects are expected to cause permanent errors in future technology nodes, which are targeted by NoC-based architectures. Consequently, fault tolerance concepts are necessary in order to deal with these permanent errors. In this work, we propose a novel approach for fault tolerance in NoC-based architectures. We introduce an additional network layer to take over the duties of defective routers. In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed concept is independent of the routing algorithm and can substitute the bandwidth of defective routers. In addition, we show the potential of the concept for power saving. An ASIC implementation of the proposed design is used for performance and power saving evaluation as well as for overhead analysis."

Based on the obtained conditions, the mode-dependent filter gains are further designed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, it is compared to four and five-parameter logistic function. Two models, namely, auto-regression moving average (ARMA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are applied to forecast wind speed. Results show that proposed model outperforms some other existing parametric wind turbine models."

This paper states the basic principles of power system restoration focussed on the voltage ramp-up approach, employing a simulation model that allows the analysis of the network in its normal operation state and the restoration state. Fault scenarios are analysed to determine to what extent the mathematically boundary line that separates the faultless from the faulty network status differ according to the previous system state and how this is reflected in the relay settings. Furthermore, a brief examination of the topological rearrangements and their influence on the fault clearing time of distance protection relays is presented."

How can we be sure that distribution networks really are correctly protected? How can we be sure that faults are correctly isolated and service restored in a minimum time? Standardization and testing would be the normal answer to that question for network components under strictly controlled laboratory environments. However, the problem arises when we wish to \"type test\" complete networks, including increasingly complex digital devices, their associated software and communication systems, to verify the correct performance of the whole protection system. Traditionally, these functional tests are carried out through simulation or on real networks when the operator allows it. For this, we decided to build a 'laboratory', called Demonstration and Experimentation Unit (UDEX), a real grid designed as a platform for the research, development and verification of new technologies, products, services and systems. It permits the reproduction of normal conditions and anomalous situations such as network failures. To highlight the methodology, capabilities and benefits of such infrastructures, we present one particular case study dealing with aspects of the distribution automation application, FLISR (Fault Location Isolation and Service Restoration)."

This paper discusses the fuel requirements for driving the chemical processes are the starting point for the assessment. These are found to be rather similar through-out the industry, with only minor differences between different facilities. Higher chemical varability increases the heat requirements as more heat is required for the reactions and the reaction temperatures are higher. Thermal efficiency is primarily determined by the thermal recuperation of heat contained in the fuel combustion exhaust gases and the intermediate product, clinker. This heat is recuperated in preheaters and clinker coolers respectively. The factors that drive efficient heat recuperation are discussed and simple performance assessment indicators provided. Operators who pay close attention to their thermal performance can reduce operating costs and obtain a competitive advantage in the market."

Biomass is one of the renewable resources and different conversions processes are used to produce second generation biofuel from lignocellulosic biomass. Pretreatment is required to extract biofuel from lignocellulosic biomass to improve hydrolysis processes for fermentable sugars. In the conventional heating process heat is transferred into the reactant by convection, conduction and radiation from the beginning to the end. Thereby, conventional heating processes for pretreatment require more energy and consume more time that reduces overall efficiency. However, in the microwave heating for pretreatment is unlike the conventional heating because the heat produced inside the materials. To improve the synthesis process of lignocellulosic biomass in to biofuel, microwave heating methods is used. However, this technology is not industrialized because it's still in the research stage. In this study, several publications are reviewed and summarized to demonstrate microwave heating application for second generation biofuel production."

Currently, state diagnosis of power equipment is mostly based on one single monitoring parameter. In this paper, a comprehensive analysing method was presented based on the mining of multi-source monitoring data, offering a new thought to analyse the states and defects of power equipment. The proposed method was applied on analysing the time-sequence and correlation of multi-source online monitoring data of a defective UHV reactor. According to the analysis results, the cause of the defects were investigated. The practice shows that the analysing method proposed in this paper can be applied on the defect diagnosis of power equipment, and the multi-source monitoring data contributes to improve the diagnosis accuracy."

Enhanced Shock Burst technology is provided for addressing of the devices during the formation of wireless network. However, it allows to connect on the same frequency only a small number of devices, which complicates the creation of a large-scale multi-user network. In this regard, an algorithm that allows to enlarge capabilities of these transceivers and, consequently, capabilities of wireless sensor network was developed. This algorithm uses a special commands embedded in data packets of measurement information, and it allows to increase the network opportunities at the software level. Thus the algorithm does not exclude checking the integrity of packages on the physical level."

        "abstract": "The cement industry relies upon silos for storage of materials throughout the process of the creation of cement. Many arrive on site at a production facility fully realizing that mechanical systems and equipment need maintenance, but never think twice about their storage structures. Unfortunately, this can lead to tragic consequences for facility personnel as attested to by past failures. Many factors affect the behavior of storage silos. From the type of silo (raw material, blending, clinker, finish cement, and beyond), reclaim system, feeding system, construction date, contractor, design engineer, modifications to the structure, and more, there are many factors that can affect the behavior of a silo. Fortunately, silos typically give notices and warnings prior to failure. Observation of cracking patterns, concrete chunks in reclaim, delaminating and spalling concrete, and others can be sure indicators that something unintended is happening with your silos. A silo inspection by an experienced engineer can make sense of what the silo is telling us. Not all cracks are created the same, and different cracking patterns mean different issues. Silos, especially those around cement production, have their own unique issues. From abrasion and impact loads, to asymmetric flow, over pressurization from pneumatic feed systems, rat holing and bridging, differential foundation settlement can lead to disastrous results that could be better managed with the creation and implementation of an inspection program. This paper will discuss: Some of these warning signs in detail,; Failure modes (from hopper to wall connection failures, wall damage, roof beam support issues and collapse) in silos,; Give owners tips on what to seek during their plant walk downs, and show how an inspection program can arm owners of silos, both at individual plants as well as a fleet of facilities with information for their future planning."

As one of the distinctive features of the material, measurement of the RI is nowadays used in many areas including the food, oil and petroleum industry, biomedical applications, and environmental analysis. In recent years, fiber optic based refractometers become highly popular thanks to the advantages they provide compared to other methods used in the above mentioned fields. Two fiber optic refractive index sensors were investigated in this study: Fresnel reflection based- and long-period fiber grating (LPFG) based-refractometers. The former uses SMF fiber tip as sensing point interrogated by an OTDR from a distant location, where the latter examines the changes in the resonance wavelength. Experimental work realised on different concentrations of glucose-water and glycerol-water solutions successfully demonstrated the capability of the proposed sensor in measuring RI of liquid chemicals with a precision of 1.7√ó10-4 (Fresnel-based sensor) and maximum sensitivity of 193.42 nm/RIU (LPGF based sensor)."

The percentage of renewable energy source is expending in power distribution system. For these reasons, there are many researches concerning DC distribution system recently because significantly gains like efficiency, stability, reliability and controllability can be achieved by transferring to the DC from the AC in power system. This current trend is towards power utilities which supply electricity to customers. It is expected that DC customers like IDC, DC building and DC home will demand power utilities to provide the direct DC electric power at early date. Therefore, we need to DC power distribution system development according to the DC power supply requirements. LVDC is new distribution system with several advantages such as efficiency improvement, cost saving, CO2 reduction, by providing 120V ~ 1500V low voltage DC power directly to the customer. At present, a study is in progress all over the world for the LVDC distribution, in order to apply the grid it is necessary to do verification for the safety and reliability. KEPCO (Korea Electric Power Corporation) which is the Korea electric utility manufactures LVDC core electrical facilities prototype and carries out demonstration tests considering the characteristics of the DC distribution system. This paper presents design, construction and demonstration test results of LVDC distribution demonstration site. Its LVDC distribution demonstration contains filed application simulator which consists of power conversion units, load(AC/DC) simulator system, protection system, digital power meter, AC transfer system.

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the extraction of the seismic events from noisy seismic records. Seismic signals are nonlinear and can be modeled by a nonlinear dynamical system. Accurate estimation of seismic signals is very important in geological structure studies. It is typical that the signal is corrupted by noise, especially during the data acquisition process. This results in the loss of important information embedded in the measured or the acquired data. This work proposes the particle filtering, a class of sequential Monte Carlo methods, along with the seismic wavelet model for the tracking of the seismic events of the noisy seismic signals. The method is evaluated on the synthetic noisy data with different noise levels. Moreover, the method is tested on multiple events seismic records to show its performance when the signals are more complex. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method delivers excellent seismic event estimates under noisy observations."

In order to simplify the coding method for genetic operation process, decimal integer coding method is used for variable encoding of rules. The optimization control strategy model is imported into vehicle model for simulation. The results show that the optimized control strategy based on improved genetic algorithm has better performance than basic genetic algorithm."

In this paper, we shows how the mmWave beamforming cellular system can operate and which kind of new handovers UEs can experience. And we propose UE controlled beam switching mechanism based on contention based uplink channels. In this mechanism, UEs switch the serving beam to the target beam without random access delay using the pre-acquired contention based channels."

But each of methods contains some limitations, such as in single word processing, synonyms merging and so on. In order to solve these problems, the intelligence extraction method based on hierarchical combination strategy is proposed. It is divided into three layers: the first layer is the document preprocessing layer, the second layer is the words preparation layer, and the third layer is the term extraction layer. The effectiveness of this method is verified by experimental data in the field of weapon and equipment. Comparing with the traditional method, it is proved that this method has good accuracy and recall rate for the domain terms extraction based on the Chinese Web documents."

The improved factor is used to determine the improved performance of wind turbine with the increment of turbine blades. The improve factor for one to six blades of a wind turbine is evaluated based on three different commercial wind turbine parameters. The computational simulation results show that wind turbines rotating at low wind speed performs better with more turbines blades due to unity effective factor. High improve factors of a wind turbine can be achieved from the increment of one to two blades and two to three blades. This paper contributes to the computational simulation evaluation of effective and improve factors for the determination of a suitable blade configuration in a wind turbine design with a given constraint on the mechanical output power."

For adaptive bandwidth selection a new algorithm for determining a set of nearest neighbors on the basis of analytical method ABC-analysis is proposed.

The core of these novel HRWS-MTI algorithms is the so called Matched Reconstruction Filter Bank (MRFB). By applying the MRFB, low PRF moving target signals can be reconstructed and refocused. Additionally, accurate estimates of the target motion parameters are obtained. In this paper the experimental verification of the MRFB principle is presented for the first time. For the verification real multi-channel airborne data acquired with DLR's F-SAR sensor over a maritime scenario are used."

In order to achieve high data rates with good amount of spectral efficiency, it is required to allocate resources optimally. Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) is used to provide control information to the attached User equipment (UE). The resource elements to represent PDCCH are limited hence it is required to effectively allocate resources within this channel. The allocation of PDCCH resources for each UE is based on quantity of information and RB location depends on UE RNTI. This paper mainly focuses on effective method to allocate RNTI for UEs in order to minimize the Control Channel Element (CCE) collision. The proposed method of RNTI allocation has been compared with other existing methods using simulation."

SVM classifier categorizes the affected region in the image as normal or abnormal. The performance of the SVM classifier is compared with Scaled Conjugate Gradient - Back Propagation Network (SCG-BPN) classifier and Generalized Regression Network (GRN) classifier.

The technique developed here uses all frequency resolutions of Discrete Wavelet Transform this gives the information of texture features present in malware image with different resolutions based on the grayscale image. The efficiency of malware class identification or recognition is based on the wavelet transform. In this, paper we are using db4 wavelet family for decompose of malware into three level decomposing. The most effective statistical features like energy and standard deviations are calculated to build feature vector. The combined feature vector is used to identify the given malware samples which family it belongs. We are classifying the malware with more accuracy compared to existing work. The accuracy of malware class recognition is improved by 98.88% accuracy and precision is 99% respectively."

The model is based on finite element simulation and the description of crack propagation in the region near the Al-Si interface (wedge crack) through a modified Paris law. To improve the lifetime of wire bonds, the mechanical stiffness of the wedge can be reduced through geometric alteration; this can be done e.g. through laser cutting. The impact of the modified geometry on crack propagation rate and thus on wire bond lifetime is calculated using the new modelling technique."

It improves transient time in load regulation. This also can maintain range of wide load current, advantage of Dual mode buck converter. The proposed Dual Buck Converter is fabricated in 180nm CMOS 1-poly 6-metal process and occupies a core effective area of 1.35 mm2. Measurement environment are input voltage range of 2.7~3.3V, output voltage 1.2V and load current range from 10mA to 500mA.

As the IC design flow spans the globe - driven by cost-conscious consumer electronics - hardware is increasingly prone to reverse engineering, Intellectual Property (IP) piracy and malicious modifications (i.e., hardware trojans). An attacker, anywhere within the global design flow, can reverse engineer the functionality of an IC/IP, steal and claim ownership of the IP or introduce counterfeits into the supply chain. Moreover, an untrusted IC fab may overbuild ICs and sell them illegally. Finally, rogue elements in the fabs may insert hardware trojans into the design without the knowledge of the designer or the end-user of the IC; this additional functionality may subsequently be exploited to introduce errors in the results, steal sensitive information or incapacitate a fielded system. The semiconductor industry routinely loses $billions annually due to these attacks. This talk will cover various forms of threats that the electronic chip supply chain is up against, as well as defenses against these threats. The talk will elucidate the development of CAD algorithms/tools for this newly emerging field by mostly leveraging principles from other more mature research domains."

A potentially attractive alternative device is the silicon super-junction MOSFET. However, the behaviour of the intrinsic diode and output capacitance of this device is problematic. An external diode network can be used to provide intrinsic diode deactivation. The selection of these diodes and their interaction with the device output capacitances is investigated. The proposed circuitry is demonstrated in a 1.1kW converter operating from 400V and switching at between 50kHz and 125kHz."

Impurity ion spectra ranging from vacuum ultra violet (vuv) to visible wavelengths was observed in an advanced beam-driven field-reversed configuration (FRC) plasmas1. Main impurity spectral lines were identified and modeled with the help of the collisional-radiative code NOMAD2. Impurity concentrations were estimated, based on the modeling results. Radial distribution of impurity charge states was reconstructed for the first time in an FRC experiment. Analysis of vuv spectra revealed quite low Zeff both inside and outside the FRC separatrix."

Research institutions such as university, institution and research center, are focal point of academic research. We have used simple and quantitative bibliometric analysis for the evaluation of research institutions. Nowadays some study show qualitative and network-based bibliometric analysis has been implemented for this purpose as a new approach. As such a new approach, this research shows network-based bibliometric analysis to understand research institutions characteristics qualitatively and show new standard for the evaluation of research institutions, using co-authorship analysis. As a result and discussion, we suggested some network index may represent their institutions' academic situation and power on their field and country."
