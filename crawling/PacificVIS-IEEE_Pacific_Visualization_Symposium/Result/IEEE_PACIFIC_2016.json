In this paper, we propose a new semantic word cloud taking into account the word semantic meanings. Distributed word representation is applied to accurately describe the semantic meaning of words, and a word similarity graph is constructed based on the semantic distance between words to lay out words in a more compact and aesthetic manner. Word-related interactions are introduced to guide users fast read and understand the text. We apply the proposed word cloud to user generated reviews in different fields to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

Edge bundling techniques have been proposed to solve cluttering issue for standard graphs while few efforts were done to deal with the similar issue for multilayer graphs. In multilayer graphs scenario, not only the clutter induced by large amount of edges is a problem but also the fact that different type of edges can overlap each other making useless the final visualization. In this paper we introduce a new multilayer graph edge bundling technique that firstly produces a preliminary edge bundling independently of the different edge layers and then deals with the specificity of multilayer graphs where more than one type of edges can be routed on the same bundle. The proposed visualization is tested on a real world case study and the outcomes point out the ability of our proposal to discover patterns present in the data."

For ensemble of isosurfaces, visualizing these spatial differences among the surfaces is essential to get useful insights as to how the individual ensemble simulations affect different isosurfaces. We propose a scheme to visualize the spatial variations of isosurfaces with respect to statistically significant isosurfaces within the ensemble. Understanding such variations among ensemble of isosurfaces at different spatial regions is helpful in analyzing the influence of different ensemble runs over the spatial domain. In this regard, we propose an isosurface-entropy based clustering scheme to divide the spatial domain into regions of high and low isosurface variation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by successfully applying it on real-world ensemble data sets from ocean simulation experiments and weather forecasts."

Curves are mainly used for two purposes: one is to increase readability and the other is to enhance visual aesthetic pleasingness. Although curves can be visually pleasing, the introduction of curves in graph drawing does not increase readability automatically. Attempts have been made to investigate the usability of curved drawings. However, the results on the effect of curves per se on human graph comprehension has not been conclusive. This paper presents a user study that is to examine the effect of curves when they are introduced to remove crossings. Twenty-six participants were recruited to perform typical graph reading tasks. Task performance and user preference data were collected for analysis. The results indicate that curves can be a useful alternative when crossings are to be present in straight-line drawings. The findings of the study are also discussed along with some of our future research activities in this paper."

It is a challenging problem to generate accurate streamlines in uncertain vector fields due to the global uncertainty transportation. In this work, we present a novel probabilistic method for streamline computation on uncertain steady vector fields using a Bayesian framework. In our framework, a streamline is modeled as a state space model which captures the spatial coherence of integration steps and uncertainty in local distributions using the conditional prior density and the likelihood function. To approximate the posterior distribution for all the possible traces originating from a given seed position, a set of weighted samples are iteratively updated from which streamlines with higher likelihood can be derived. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare our method with alternative methods on different types of flow field data sets. Our method can generate possible streamlines with higher certainty and hence more accurate flow traces."

In addition, current visualization interfaces only display the results associated with a single attribute, thus requiring users to interact intensively to find their targets. Inspired by the user experiences (UX) in physical bookstores, we present Bookwall, an online bookstore interface which comprises two components: Category Map and Wall View, enabling users to find their targets more efficiently and releasing users from the burden of complicated operations. Specifically, the category map produces a map with a \"natural\" map-like look, providing an overview of the clusters and neighborhood of book categories. The wall view enables displaying query results satisfying dual query attributes simultaneously. The results show that Bookwall can provide the users a favourable alternative visualization."

Among the 2002, the best measure is the average proportion of same-class neighbors among the 0.35-Observable Neighbors of each point of the target class (short GONG 0.35 DIR CPT), with a prediction accuracy of 92.9%, which is 11.7% better than DSC.

The visualization of this graph, combined with multiple-linked views showing details, enables users to explore, select, and compare the extracted regions that have similar behaviors. The driving application of this paper is the study of regional emission influences over tropospheric ozone, based on the ensemble simulations conducted with different anthropogenic emission absences using MOZART-4. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by visualizing the MOZART-4 ensemble simulation data and evaluating the relative regional emission influences on tropospheric ozone concentrations."

        "abstract": "A bipartite graph models the relation between two different types of entities. It is applicable, for example, to describe persons' affiliations to different social groups or their association with subjects such as topics of interest. In these applications, it is important to understand the connectivity patterns among the entities in the bipartite graph. For the example of a bipartite relation between persons and their topics of interest, people may form groups based on their common interests, and the topics also can be grouped or categorized based on the interested audiences. Co-clustering methods can identify such connectivity patterns and find clusters within the two types of entities simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an interactive visualization design that incorporates co-clustering methods to facilitate the identification of node clusters formed by their common connections in a bipartite graph. Besides highlighting the automatically detected node clusters and the connections among them, the visual interface also provides visual cues for evaluating the homogeneity of the bipartite connections in a cluster, identifying potential outliers, and analyzing the correlation of node attributes with the cluster structure. The interactive visual interface allows users to flexibly adjust the node grouping to incorporate their prior knowledge of the domain, either by direct manipulation (i.e., splitting and merging the clusters), or by providing explicit feedback on the cluster quality, based on which the system will learn a parametrization of the co-clustering algorithm to better align with the users' notion of node similarity. To demonstrate the utility of the system, we present two example usage scenarios on real world datasets."

It suffers from one main drawback though: The definition of critical points, which is the foundation of vector field topology, is highly dependent on the frame of reference. In this paper we propose to consider every point as a critical point and locally adjust the frame of reference to the most persistent ones, that means the extrema of the determinant of the Jacobian. The result is not the extraction of one well-suited frame of reference, but the simultaneous visualization of the dominating frames of reference in the different areas of the flow field. Each of them could individually be perceived by an observer traveling along these critical points. We show all important ones at once."

Compared with traditional methods (e.g., pointwise Euclidean distance or dynamic time warping distance), the proposed approach is robust to outliers, missing data, and the sampling rate of the pathline timesteps. Taking advantage of smaller and reusable intermediate output, visualization based on the proposed LCSS approach reveals temporal trends in the data at low storage cost and avoids tracing pathlines repeatedly. We evaluate our method on both synthetic data and simulation data, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach."

Nowadays many text-based data sets, such as Flickr tags, are geo-referenced, that is, they have an important spatial component. However, existing automated methods to generate word clouds are unable to incorporate such spatial information. We introduce geo word clouds: word clouds which capture not only the frequency but also the spatial relevance of words. Our input is a set of locations from one (or more) geographic regions with (possibly several) text labels per location. We aggregate word frequencies according to point clusters and employ a greedy strategy to place appropriately sized labels without overlap as close as possible to their corresponding locations. While doing so we \"draw\" the spatial shapes of the geographic regions with the corresponding labels. We experimentally explore trade-offs concerning the location of labels, their relative sizes and the number of spatial clusters. The resulting word clouds are visually pleasing and have a low error in terms of relative scaling and locational accuracy of words, while using a small number of clusters per label."

We first present a taxonomy of visualizations of movement data, and then consider tasks to support when analyzing movement data and especially meetings of multiple actors. We argue that Gantt charts have many advantages for understanding the movements and meetings of small groups of moving entities, and present the design of a Gantt chart that can nest people within locations or locations within people along the vertical axis, and show time along the horizontal axis. The rows of our Gantt chart are sorted by activity level and can be filtered using a weighted adjacency matrix showing meetings between people. Empty time intervals in the Gantt chart can be automatically folded, with smoothly animated transitions, yielding a multi-focal view. Case studies demonstrate the utility of our prototype."

A visually interactive exploration of subspaces and clusters is a cyclic process. Every meaningful discovery will motivate users to re-search subspaces that can provide improved clustering results and reveal the relationships among clusters that can hardly coexist in the original subspaces. However, the combination of dimensions from the original subspaces is not always effective in finding the expected subspaces. In this study, we present an approach that enables users to reconstruct new dimensions from the data projections of subspaces to preserve interesting cluster information. The reconstructed dimensions are included into an analytical workflow with the original dimensions to help users construct target-oriented subspaces which clearly display informative cluster structures. We also provide a visualization tool that assists users in the exploration of subspace clusters by utilizing dimension reconstruction. Several case studies on synthetic and real-world data sets have been performed to prove the effectiveness of our approach. Lastly, further evaluation of the approach has been conducted via expert reviews."

However, logistic regression modeling faces challenges such as overfitting, confounding, and multicollinearity when there is a large number of explanatory variables. For example, in the birth defect study presented in this paper, variable selection for building high quality models to identify risk factors from hundreds of pollutant variables is difficult. To address this problem, we propose a novel visual analytics approach to logistic regression modeling for high-dimensional datasets. It leverages the traditional modeling pipeline by providing (1) intuitive visualizations for inspecting statistical indicators and the relationships among the variables and (2) a seamless, effective dimension reduction pipeline for selecting variables for inclusion in high quality logistic regression models. A fully working prototype of this approach has been developed and successfully applied to the birth defect study, which illustrates its effectiveness and efficiency. Its application in an insurance policy study and feedback from domain experts further demonstrate its usefulness."

However, in order to fully understand subtleties in the merger trees, other data types derived from the simulation must be incorporated as well. In this work, we develop a novel interactive linked-view visualization system that focuses on simultaneously exploring dark matter halos, their hierarchical evolution, corresponding particle data, and other quantitative information. We employ a parallel remote renderer and a local merger tree selection tool so that users can analyze large data sets interactively. This allows scientists to assess their simulation code, understand inconsistencies in extracted data, and intuitively understand simulation behavior on all scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through a set of case studies on large-scale cosmological data from the HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code) simulation framework."

        "abstract": "User evaluations have gained increasing importance in visualization research over the past years, as in many cases these evaluations are the only way to support the claims made by visualization researchers. Unfortunately, recent literature reviews show that in comparison to algorithmic performance evaluations, the number of user evaluations is still very low. Reasons for this are the required amount of time to conduct such studies together with the difficulties involved in participant recruitment and result reporting. While it could be shown that the quality of evaluation results and the simplified participant recruitment of crowdsourcing platforms makes this technology a viable alternative to lab experiments when evaluating visualizations, the time for conducting and reporting such evaluations is still very high. In this paper, we propose a software system, which integrates the conduction, the analysis and the reporting of crowdsourced user evaluations directly into the scientific visualization development process. With the proposed system, researchers can conduct and analyze quantitative evaluations on a large scale through an evaluation-centric user interface with only a few mouse clicks. Thus, it becomes possible to perform iterative evaluations during algorithm design, which potentially leads to better results, as compared to the time consuming user evaluations traditionally conducted at the end of the design process. Furthermore, the system is built around a centralized database, which supports an easy reuse of old evaluation designs and the reproduction of old evaluations with new or additional stimuli, which are both driving challenges in scientific visualization research. We will describe the system's design and the considerations made during the design process, and demonstrate the system by conducting three user evaluations, all of which have been published before in the visualization literature."

        "abstract": "In nuclear engineering, understanding the safety margins of the nuclear reactor via simulations is arguably of paramount importance in predicting and preventing nuclear accidents. It is therefore crucial to perform sensitivity analysis to understand how changes in the model inputs affect the outputs. Modern nuclear simulation tools rely on numerical representations of the sensitivity information — inherently lacking in visual encodings — offering limited effectiveness in communicating and exploring the generated data. In this paper, we design a framework for sensitivity analysis and visualization of multidimensional nuclear simulation data using partition-based, topology-inspired regression models and report on its efficacy. We rely on the established Morse-Smale regression technique, which allows us to partition the domain into monotonic regions where easily interpretable linear models can be used to assess the influence of inputs on the output variability. The underlying computation is augmented with an intuitive and interactive visual design to effectively communicate sensitivity information to nuclear scientists. Our framework is being deployed into the multipurpose probabilistic risk assessment and uncertainty quantification framework RAVEN (Reactor Analysis and Virtual Control Environment). We evaluate our framework using a simulation dataset studying nuclear fuel performance."

We identified images, attributes, and categories as important aspects and integrated these in a system called ICLIC. The system consists of four views that are connected by the selection of images, which is a central action in the approach. By using a minimalist interface with only standard metaphors, users are enabled to use the system in short time. The system enables complex queries in a natural way, and it can deal with collections containing more than 100,000 images and more than 1,000 metadata attributes.

Thus, studying these features along with the exploration of their dynamic behavior helps to understand the processes ongoing in living cells. This can be reached by the visual representation of these processes as visualization is one of the most natural ways to convey such information. However, none of the currently available techniques provides the biochemists with an intuitive real-time representation of the dynamic movements of molecules and precise geometrical based extraction of their structural features performed instantly. In this paper we introduce such a technique enabling the user to compute and also to visualize the molecular surface along with inner voids. To obtain a better insight into the molecule, our technique enables to visualize the molecular surface transparently. The opacity can be adjusted by changing user-defined parameters in order to enhance the perception of the surfaces of inner voids. All integrated algorithms run in real-time which gives the user a big variety of exploration possibilities. The importance of our approach is even amplified with respect to the fact that currently the size of molecular dynamics simulations is increasing dramatically and offline rendering thus becomes impracticable. The usability of our technique was evaluated by the domain experts."

However, when the number of time series becomes very large, the layers representing time series with small values take up only very small proportions in the stacked graph, making them hard to trace. As a result, it is challenging for analysts to detect the correlation of individual layers and their aggregation, and find trend similarities and differences between layers solely with stacked graphs. In this paper, we study the correlations of individual layers, and their aggregation in time series data presented with stacked graphs, focusing on the local regions within any given time intervals. Specifically, we present STAC, an interactive visual analytics system, to help analysts gain insights into the correlations in stacked graphs. While preserving the original stacked shape, we further link a stacked graph with auxiliary views to facilitate the in-depth analysis of correlations in time series data. A case study based on a real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our system in gaining insights into time series data analysis and facilitating various analytical tasks."

Arc length based aspect ratio selection (AL) has demonstrated many empirical advantages over previous methods. However, it is still not clear why and when this method works. In this paper, we attempt to unravel its mystery by exploring its mathematical foundation. First, we explain the rationale why this method is parameterization invariant and follow the same rationale to extend previous methods which are not parameterization invariant. As such, we propose maximizing weighted local curvature (MLC), a parameterization invariant form of local orientation resolution (LOR) and reveal the theoretical connection between average slope (AS) and resultant vector (RV). Furthermore, we establish a mathematical connection between AL and banking to 45 degrees and derive the upper and lower bounds of its average absolute slopes. Finally, we conduct a quantitative comparison that revises the understanding of aspect ratio selection methods in three aspects: (1) showing that AL, AWO and RV always perform very similarly while MS is not; (2) demonstrating the advantages in the robustness of RV over AL; (3) providing a counterexample where all previous methods produce poor results while MLC works well."

Such an embedding enables new opportunities for comparative flow visualization. We present three different strategies for comparative flow visualization that take advantage of the reformation. By reforming the time surfaces, we not only mitigate occlusion issues, but we can devote also the third dimension of the visualization space to the comparative aspects of the visualization. Our approach is effective in a variety of flow study cases. The direct comparison of individual time surfaces reveals small scale differences and fine details about the fluid's motion. The concurrent study of multiple surface families enables the identification and the comparison of the most prominent motion patterns. This work was developed in close collaboration with an expert in fluid dynamics, who assessed the potential usefulness of this approach in his field."

Multi-touch interfaces can provide a natural way for us to interact with the extra degrees of freedom that characterize knots' mathematical, physical, and arithmetic properties. Relative to a specialized mouse-driven interface, the proposed multi-touch interface is easier and more intuitive to learn, and our pilot study shows that knot and braid manipulation with multi-touch is much faster and more efficient.

We propose an approach that connects user-specified cavities by computing an optimal conduit within the region occupied by the molecule. The conduit is computed using a topological representation of the occupied and empty regions and is guaranteed to satisfy well defined geometric optimality criteria. Visualization of the set of all cavities with multiple linked views serves as a useful interface for interactive extraction of stable cavities. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in successfully identifying biologically significant pathways between molecular cavities using several case studies."

        "abstract": "Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) examine genetic variants in different individuals to detect variants associated to specific diseases. The 1000 Genomes project is such a collaborative research effort to sequence the genomes of at least 1000 participants of 26 different ethnicities, to establish a detailed summary of human genetic variation. The kinship information is a measure of individuals ancestor relationships within the considered populations. We study the design of kinship data visualizations allowing the experts to discover anomalies in GWAS data. The visual analysis of the 1000 Genomes Project kinship data reveals inconsistencies which call for a deeper analysis of the data quality within this project."

        "abstract": "Zoomable user interfaces are widely used in static visualizations and have many benefits. However, they are not well supported in animated visualizations due to problems such as change blindness and information overload. We propose the spot-tracking lens, a new zoomable user interface for animated bubble charts, to tackle these problems. It couples zooming with automatic panning and provides a rich set of auxiliary techniques to enhance its effectiveness. Our preliminary user studies suggested that, besides allowing users to examine detail information, it can be an engaging approach to exploratory analysis for dynamic data."

        "abstract": "Exploration of atomic trajectories is fundamental to understanding and characterizing complex chemical systems important in many applications. For instance, any new insight into the mechanisms of ionic migration in catalytic materials could lead to a substantial increase in battery performance. A new statistical measure, called the relative-angle distribution, has been proposed to understand complex motion - whether Brownian, ballistic, or diffusive. The relative-angle distribution can be represented as a collection of 1D histograms, but is currently created in a slow, offline process, making any parameter exploration a tedious and time-consuming task. Furthermore, the resulting plot can hide uncertainty in both the data and the visualization. As a result, once rastered or printed at a fixed resolution, these histograms can be misleading. We present a new analysis tool for the exploration of atomic trajectories that combines an interactive histogram visualization with uncertainty information for both data and plotting errors, and is also linked to an interactive 3D display of trajectories. Our tool enables a holistic exploration of trajectories previously not feasible, with the potential for significant scientific impact. In collaboration with domain experts, we have deployed our tool ta analyze molecular dynamics simulations of lithium-ion diffusion. Users have found that the tool significantly accelerates the exploration process and have used it to validate a number of previously unconfirmed hypotheses."

        "abstract": "Computer-based visualization (vis) systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively. Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods. The design space of possible vis idioms is huge, and includes the considerations of both how to create and how to interact with visual representations. Vis design is full of trade-offs, and most possibilities in the design space are ineffective for a particular task, so validating the effectiveness of a design is both necessary and difficult. Vis designers must take into account three very different kinds of resource limitations: those of computers, of humans, and of displays. Vis usage can be analyzed in terms of why the user needs it, what data is shown, and how the idiom is designed. I will discuss this framework for analyzing the design of visualization systems."

Amid this excitement lies a more sombre question: if training for deep learning models is compared to software coding, what is the integrated development environment (IDE) for deep learning training? Specifically, what are the debugging and analysis tools required for manually refining and evolving a deep learning model towards its final form? In this presentation, I will survey related work in this area and outline the visualization requirements of a deep learning IDE that we are currently working on."
