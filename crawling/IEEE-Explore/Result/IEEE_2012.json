        "abstract": "This presentation will summarize work on the Pacific Northwest Smart Grid Demonstration Project. A key element of the project is development and implementation of a technique referred to as transactive control. Transactive control will provide a means of coordinating the response of smart grid assets at all levels of the power system. In simple terms transactive control may be thought of as extending the notion of locational marginal pricing throughout the power system from generation to end-use. The transactional nature of the technique, however, introduces a new element in the use of a pair of signals to implement an equivalent to market closing distributed in space and time."

However, smart meters and other smart grid technology is a tool and needs to have a purpose. This presentation asks whether we have fully made the business case for smart grids. Having a full understanding of the benefits that we hope to achieve can help prevent \"scope creep\" and allow us to define and measure success. Once we understand the benefits we hope to deliver, it becomes clear that infrastructure is only a first step. To realise the benefits of smart grid we need a radical overhaul of the sector to create an enabling framework. Markets and regulation may be restrictive. We need to incentivise utilities, generators, consumers and new entrants to develop new and innovative ideas."

Also, artificial neural networks are not commonly used in localization. In this paper, we present a 3D localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks using artificial neural networks. In the proposed scheme, the idea of the 2D localization using neural network is extended to achieve a 3D localization with simplicity, location accuracy, mobility, and low cost. The simulation results depict the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

This method employs the morphology, connected components extraction and threshold value of mean segmentation. The feature of tempered glass insulator on image is reflected its intensity information. Firstly, the intensity image is preprocessed by reducing noise. Secondly, morphological erosion is applied. Thirdly, we can extract the area by 1 in the preprocessed image as connected components, which include the part of insulator and noise. Finally, by setting the mean value as the threshold value, the connected component is classified into two parts: insulator or not. Experiments illustrated that tempered glass insulator in image can be recognized by the proposed method with little mistakes."

We start by reviewing the problem of global estimation using the Optimal Prediction Principle (OPP) by Zimmer et al. [1]. Inspired by this technique and work on local-global optical flow we propose a simple method for fusing optical flow estimates of different smoothness by evaluating interpolation quality locally by means of L1 block match on the corresponding set of gradient images. We illustrate the method in a setting where optical flows are estimated by a TV-L1 energy. On average this procedure reduces the average endpoint error by 15% over flows estimated using the OPP, and gives flow fields that are consistently better than the single best flows with a fixed smoothness parameter."

At 2.53GHz, with a 0.7V supply and a 185μW power consumption, the measured phase noise at 3MHz offset is -122.6dBc/Hz and varies by only 2.2dB over a temperature range from -30 to 120°C. For a 0.85V supply, phase noise is improved to -126.1dBc/Hz with a 280μW power consumption which corresponds to a Figure of Merit (FoM) of 190.2dB.

This paper investigates the connectivity aspects that affect a high school student’s ability to excel academically. Using data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), this paper analyzes the connections students have with their families, schools, friends, and community. Using these connections, this paper introduces an optimal prediction model named the Kalman-based Student Connectivity Model. By asking a student specific questions, this model can predict his/her cognitive reading and math performance on standardized exams. Further, this model can be used as a predictor on how modifying lifestyle choices or environmental factors may affect a student's performance in the STEM disciplines."

An existing state-space model interpolation method for LPV systems is exploited in order to derive the desired controller. The interpolation requires designing local LTI controllers for local working conditions of the system, which is performed using a multi-objective H∞ approach. To simplify the weighting function design, the H∞ objective is broken apart into different H∞ design objectives and constraints, each related to various input-output combinations. The developed LPV control design approach is illustrated on an over-head crane system."

Despite intensive research interest, the framework for analysing ultrawideband arrays is ambiguous. For OFDM based systems which use many narrowband subcarriers, the preferred choice is the use of the classical array description by means of the array factor. For impulse radio systems, array factors cannot be used and new beam pattern descriptors have been developed. In this paper we explore and quantify the transition between narrowband and ultrawideband systems. We define the upper bandwidth for which it is still acceptable to use the description by the means of classical array factors. This limit enables a rule of thumb decision on the selection of a suitable UWB MIMO strategy"

Recently, sev- eral public-key-based schemes have been proposed to achieve immediate broadcast authentication with signifi- cantly improved security strength. While the public-key- based schemes obviate the security vulnerability inherent to symmetric-key-based μTESLA-like schemes, their signature verification is time-consuming. Thus, speeding up signa- ture verification is a problem of considerable practical im- portance, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents an accelerated verification of vBNN- IBS, a pairing-free identity-based signature with reduced signature size. A quantitative analysis demonstrates that the accelerated vBNN-IBS reduces 38.62% energy consump- tion in a 4×4 grid-basedWSN and runs 66%faster than the traditional signature verification method. It also allows the total energy consumption to be reduced by up to 23.25% and 25.14% compared to, respectively, IMBAS [1] and EIBAS [13] ID-based broadcast authentication schemes."

In this paper many concepts related to controlled variable, controlling variable, control system stability, control process and so on are defined, which simulate human control thinking. Some of the concepts are defined with its feature variable and feature value. The above research provides the basis for next study of iconic imagery control thinking, and abstract logical control thinking."

        "abstract": "As project teams are increasingly becoming fluid and geographically distributed, they are more and more relying on social collaborative platforms to ensure effective communication and knowledge dissemination. However the use of these platforms poses challenges as they often cause information overload or hoarding and thus give birth to inefficient communication patterns. The study of these patterns with a network perspective is at the heart of Social Network Analysis (SNA), which is a descriptive, empirical research method for mapping and measuring relationships and flows between people, groups, and other connected information and knowledge entities. In a previous work [1], we proposed an SNA-based assessment framework to provide managers with a decision support tool to evaluate and diagnose virtual teams. In this paper we examine the process of building the SNA system based on data collected from social collaborative platforms."

Moore's Law continues to deliver ever-more transistors on an integrated circuit, but discontinuities in the progress of technology mean that the future isn't simply an extrapolation of the past. For example, design cost and complexity constraints have recently caused the microprocessor industry to switch to multi-core architectures, even though these parallel machines present programming challenges that are far from solved. Moore's Law now translates into ever-more processors on a multi-, and soon many-core chip. The software challenge is compounded by the need for increasing fault-tolerance as near-atomic-scale variability and robustness problems bite harder. We look beyond this transitional phase to a future where the availability of processor resource is effectively unlimited and computations must be optimised for energy usage rather than load balancing, and we look to biology for examples of how such systems might work. Conventional concerns such as synchronisation and determinism are abandoned in favour of real-time operation and adapting around component failure with minimal loss of system efficacy."

The relevance vector machine is a Bayesian extension of the support vector machine (SVM). The relevance vector machine has a simpler model structure, a fewer control parameter, and a faster computation speed in comparison with the support vector machine. Therefore, the compensator structure can be simpler by means of the relevance vector machine. Also, the rapid compensation of the sensor dynamic characteristics can be implemented with the proposed technique. The numerical experimental results show that the technique is still effective even if the sensor dynamic characteristics has a strong nonlinear."

The present efforts involve comprehensive management regarding alarm systems based on potential risk analysis of a plant, and work on all phases of the plant such as alarm system design, operation procedure making, performance measurement, maintenance and training in the life cycle of a plant. This paper introduces the need and overview of alarm management with a guideline EEMUA191 and a US standard ANSI/ISA18.2–2009, and the recent trend of IEC for setting an international standard."

        "abstract": "Large-scale deployment of solar power faces significant challenges integrating into the grid. Centralized PV solar generation can be subject to intermittency. Clouds inevitably pass over solar farms, resulting in problems such as voltage fluctuations, distribution losses and reduced power quality and power balancing. The only way PV generation will integrate with the grid on a large scale is for it to grow up and act like any other power plant. This paper introduces a unique controller for highly distributed AC PV modules organized in a large virtual power plant (VPP). The AC module handles reactive power injection and voltage support in close proximity to regular generators by emulating the generator performance and reactance. These AC modules offer better ramp control to mitigate the effects of power fluctuations. These advanced control algorithms are integrated into a 250 VA AC module and results are provided for several applications including micro-grids."

Our approach achieves simultaneous automatic compensation for 2nd, 3rd and 4th order dispersion using an LCOS spectral pulse shaper (SPS) as a tunable dispersion compensator and a dispersion monitor made of a photonic-chip-based all-optical RF-spectrum analyzer. The monitoring approach uses a single parameter measurement extracted from the RF-spectrum to drive a multidimensional optimization algorithm. Because these pulses are highly sensitive to fluctuations in the GVD and higher orders of chromatic dispersion, this work represents a key result towards practical transmission of ultrashort optical pulses. The dispersion can be adapted on-the-fly for a 1.28 Tbaud signal at any place in the transmission line using a black box approach."

In order reveal the essences of chaos, it is necessary to clear the relations between district notions of chaos. In this brief survey, we relate to topological chaos, Li-Yorke chaos, Devaney chaos, distributional chaos and (topological) mixing, which are several notions of chaos attracting the attention of many authors. The relations between each two of these notions are given. Indeed, one can see that Li-Yorke chaos is implied by the others, but the inverse does not hold, and topological chaos, Devaney chaos, distributional chaos and mixing are mutually independent."

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. High dimensional data in Euclidean space pose special challenges to data mining algorithms. These challenges are often indiscriminately subsumed under the term \"curse of dimensionality\", more concrete aspects being the so-called \"distance concentration effect\", the presence of irrelevant attributes concealing relevant information, or simply efficiency issues. In about just the last few years, the task of unsupervised outlier detection has found new specialized solutions for tackling high dimensional data in Euclidean space. These approaches fall under mainly two categories, namely considering or not considering subspaces (subsets of attributes) for the definition of outliers. The former are specifically addressing the presence of irrelevant attributes, the latter do consider the presence of irrelevant attributes implicitly at best but are more concerned with general issues of efficiency and effectiveness. Nevertheless, both types of specialized outlier detection algorithms tackle challenges specific to high dimensional data. In this tutorial, we discuss those aspects of the \"curse of dimensionality\" that are most important for outlier detection in detail and survey specialized algorithms for outlier detection from both categories."

However, it is inefficient only using mechanism analysis when selecting because of the complicated input-output mapping relation of boiler combustion. Based on multi-scale analysis, a new method selecting related signal is presented according to the fluctuation similarity of thermal signals. Firstly, components of different frequency ranges are obtained via multi-level wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. Then, correlation coefficients are calculated based on the assumption of fluctuation similarity between components in same frequency range, which can be used to describe the correlation degree of those components. By this method, the signals related with combustion status can be selected through calculating the correlation coefficients of their high frequency components. The calculation results using on-site data prove the validity of the proposed method."

Simulation results show that, the multi-step predictive control based on impoved GA-BP greatly optimizes the dynamic characteristics of interstand tension control system, and impoves the stability of tension and anti-interference ability."

Due to their complexity, these simulations demand massive computations with extreme levels of parallelism. At extreme scales, communication between processors could take up a substantial amount of time. This results in substantial waste in computing cycles, as processors remain idle for most of the time. We investigate a novel approach based on widely used finite-difference schemes in which computations are carried out in an asynchronous fashion - synchronization among cores is not enforced and computations proceed regardless of the status of messages. This drastically reduces idle times resulting in much larger computation rates and scalability. However, stability, consistency and accuracy have to be shown in order for these schemes to be viable. This is done through mathematical theory and numerical simulations. Results are used to design new numerical schemes robust to asynchronicity."

This paper presents results of enhancing wireless link budget based on QoS over layer 2 and 3 with a modified Radio Controlled Car. The controllable distance with line of sight (LOS) is considerably higher compared to normal RC Cars and WiFi range with a home router. QoS gives driving instruction packets priority over video packets to increase effective driving range and diminish the congestion of video UDP traffic in the link."

The double loops are closed by two digital PID controllers, and the PID parameters can be modified in real-time by the fuzzy inference system in order to optimize the PID controller. The control method can guarantee the vertical of the pendulum bar and drive the car to the desired position. The simulation results show this control method has better effectiveness and better robustness."

The spinning reserve amount is determined by a tradeoff between reliability and economics. The unreliability of units and uncertainties caused by load and nondispatchable units are both considered. In order to reduce computation burden, various uncertainties are aggregated. A multi-step method is proposed to efficiently consider the combinatorial characteristic of unit outage events. The computation efficiency of spinning reserve calculations can be greatly improved. The optimization is solved by mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Two case studies are carried out to illustrate the proposed method. Their results and discussions are also presented."

In application, every battery can't keep consistency after long-time discharge with high current because of difference. The result does harm to the storage system. Equalizer circuit based on flying capacitor was proposed to replace consume-energy equalizer circuit, then experiment was realized."

In centralized coordinated transmission from a cluster of base stations, the channel state information (CSI) of users needs to be sent to a central processor for precoding and resource allocation. Real time CSI feedback from the users to their home base station and from the base stations to the central processor is a serious challenge from a practical point of view. CSI feedback schemes based on user channel strength and distance of a user to its home base station are proposed that reduce feedback overhead while having not much affect on system throughput. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes."

This paper will summarize China's public and private sector programs designed to promote large scale solar PV penetration. These incentive programs contributed to the impressive growth rates in recent years while China's share of PV installations is quite small compared to global total installations. Some project examples are used to illustrate the reasons why some industry companies are worrying to expand their business in China's PV market. Based on the analysis of policies and programs, this paper discusses the ‘2011 New Recommendations for China PV Policy Roadmap’ released by SEMI and CPIA, and some suggestions will be proposed to meet the requirements of China's PV market."

The control objective is to make the beam of the TRMS move quickly and accurately to the desired attitudes. The TRMS exhibits MIMO characteristics, high order non-linearity, significant cross coupling and inaccessibility of some of its states and outputs for measurements. PSO Algorithm is successfully implemented to this problem. Experimental and simulated results of the developed PID controller for a twin rotor system are given to demonstrate its effectiveness. Satisfactory results are anticipated in the experimental as well as in the simulation results. In an attempt to evaluate the performance of the developed controller an experimental and simulated comparative assessments with the conventionally PID tuned method (Ziegler-Nichols method) has been conducted. The results of the PID controller based PSO reveals better performances indices than GA method and the ZN method."

It is ideal for measuring group delay and relative phase at frequency converting components without LO access and also works if the LO frequency is unstable. This method is extended to perform measurements on test ports separated by a large distance. The only requirement is two vector network analyzers, one at each test port, but no coaxial connection between both instruments. The communication between both instruments is established via a LAN/LXI interface."
