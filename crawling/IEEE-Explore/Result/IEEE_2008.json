In order to establish the state estimation function, pseudo- measurements need to be introduced. As there is generalised uncertainty in the power demand, the load characteristics can be utilised to appropriately model the pseudo-measurements. This paper proposes two new approaches for modelling pseudo-measurements for the purpose of distribution system state estimation; the first is based on correlation and the second is based on load probability density functions."

If a noise corrupted observation is conditionally independent of the system state, Bayes rule can be used in an optimal, recursive manner. However, this assumption rarely holds true in practice. One cause of dependency is modelling errors: any process or observation model is an approximation and incorrectly describes the true response of the system. A second cause is simplification. Even if the models are precisely known, the full Bayesian computations could be prohibitively expensive and some approximation must be used. The problem of unmodelled dependency is often addressed through judicious tuning. However this can lead, in some circumstances, to an unacceptable degradation of estimator performance. One class of problems where this can arise is distributed data fusion (DDF), where unmodelled dependencies lead to double counting."

After image pre-processing, the local orientations are determined in small windows obtained by image paving. The orientation of the text within each window is estimated using the projection profile technique considering several projection angles. Then, the windows which close angles are gathered into largest zones. We use the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) to estimate the global orientation of each zone. The WVD is more precise than the classical projection profile technique. Afterwards, the text lines are extracted in each zone basing on the follow-up of the baselines and the proximity of connected components. The experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme. It has been evaluated on 50 documents reaching an accuracy of about 97.6%."

The common layout errors in handwriting samples are summarized and then a new layout evaluation method is proposed. The method is consisted of three parts of stroke layout evaluation, component layout evaluation and entire character shape evaluation, through the application of nine assessment rules. The experiment results show that the method is capable for detecting layout errors of handwriting samples and making objective assessment on whether a character is written good or not."

In this talk I will introduce the algorithm, show its connections to social behaviours in humans and other species, and discuss effects of variations in rules and parameters. I will tend to emphasise research that simplifies the algorithm rather than making it harder, as researchers come to understand what is essential for intelligence to emerge in a population of simple interacting entities."

The methods are tested on both Latin (English) and non-Latin (Khmer) scripts. Results show that the character-level recognition accuracy exceeds 92\\% for Khmer and 96\\% for English on degraded documents.

        "abstract": "Health assessment and thermal management play a key role in reliability modelling of power electronic devices. In practice, electronic devices are subjected to pulsed power dissipation under variable operating conditions, so the temperatures of the semiconductor junctions and associated packaging vary continually. In principle, junction temperature-time information can be used to drive a reliability model, for example it can be used to determine wire bond life, which is largely governed by die temperature. However, for interfaces away from the surface, such as solder layers, measurement of temperature is difficult and therefore direct determination of the thermal parameters for the solder layers and other hidden layers within the module's package is impracticable. In this paper an alternative approach is presented. A validated FLOTHERM model is developed to predict the temperatures of the solder layers and other hidden layers within the module. The thermal parameters of the heat transfer path from any heat source (die) to the hidden layer were determined using the predicted values from the FLOTHERM model rather than direct measurements. The FLOTHERM model is validated using measurable surface temperatures, for example at junctions and the baseplate. Results are presented showing the application of the model under a range of power cycling conditions."

For general bistatic configurations, LBF works well. However, because spaceborne/airborne case is the high bistatic grade configuration, LBF might degrade the image quality. The reason is that the equal contributions of transmitter and receiver to the overall phase modulation of the azimuth signal are assumed. To address this problem, the azimuth time-bandwidth products (TBP) are used to weight the contributions of transmitter and receiver to the overall phase modulation of the azimuth signal. Based on the weighting operation, we extend LBF to work in the spaceborne/airborne configuration. Simulation results validate our extension."

Initially, strokes are grouped into text line strings according to off-stroke distances. Each text line string is segmented into text lines by dynamic programming (DP) optimizing a cost function trained by the minimum classification error (MCE) method. Over-segmented text lines are then merged with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for making merge/non-merge decisions, and last, a spatial merge module corrects the segmentation errors caused by delayed strokes. In experiments on the TUAT Kondate database, the proposed approach achieves the Entity Detection Metric (EDM) rate of 0.8816, the Edit-Distance Rate (EDR) of 0.1234, which demonstrates the superiority of our approach."

        "abstract": "To overcome interference, OFDMA networks support different but fixed frequency reuse schemes and subchannel allocation techniques. However, these fixed schemes and techniques are not the most suitable solutions in mobile scenarios, where the behaviour of the channel and the users are continuously changing during the day-time. This paper presents a new approach to the frequency assignment problem adapted to OFDMA networks, called Dynamic Frequency Planning, which in turn may decrease the interference and increase the capacity of the network by around 20%. DFP operates in a regular basis, adapting the network configuration to the time-dependent channel conditions and user requirements. On the other hand, DFP uses novel algorithms to estimate the inputs of the frequency assignment problem and tailored versions of meta-heuristic such as Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search, or Greedy Algorithms to solve it. Further discussion about the trade off between the quality of the solution and computing time when using meta-heuristic or greedy algorithm is provided. This paper also indicates, when running DFP, how to check the improvements in the network performance. Experimental evaluations carried out using system level simulations show the boost in the capacity when using DFP."

To overcome the weaknesses of these systems, we propose a new analysis strategy, based on an intermediate representation, called XCDF, which enables representing physical structures in a canonical way. This paper then describes the PDF reverse engineering workflow and focuses on the document logical restructuring. Finally, the paper concludes with potential future improvements."

The particle based maximum a posteriori (MAP) point estimator that has been recently developed is applied to this problem. It is shown by means of simulation that it provides a large improvement over the mean estimate."

From one side an electro thermal analysis of the interaction between power device and load in order to identify the stresses applied to the physical structure and on the other side the formulation of a reliability model of the device physical structure versus the stresses. Both the system designer and the smart power device designers take benefits from this methodology: the system designer can safely choose the smart power actuator while the silicon designer can optimize the device protection architecture."

We propose a word extraction method which generates multiple character hypotheses and extracts their combinations which correspond with the character orders of words. Firstly character hypotheses which overlap with each other are generated by combinatorial recognition of connected components and their combinations which correspond with words are extracted by clique extraction from a graph. And then, character hypotheses are generated by recognition with limited target and their combinations which correspond with words areextracted by matching between lattices based on local optimum, in which variety of recognition results and regular expression of words are considered. We confirmed the effect of our method by the experiment for form images."

In dynamic and highly populated environments, this problem presents a complex and computationally demanding task. It can be divided in sub-problems such as robot's relative motion compensation, feature extraction, measurement clustering, data association and targets' state vector estimation. In this paper we present an innovative approach that addresses all these issues exploiting various probabilistic and deterministic techniques. The algorithm utilizes real laser-scanner data to dynamically extract moving objects from their background environment, using a time-fading grid map method, and tracks the identified targets employing a joint probabilistic data association with interacting multiple model (JPDA-IMM) algorithm. The resulting technique presents a computationally efficient approach to already existing target-tracking research for real time application scenarios."

This evolving graph model is combined with the sequential Monte Carlo framework and its effectiveness is illustrated over a complex scenario for group motion estimation in urban environment.

The interaction between the nodes is based on wireless communication. Since the energy is a scarce and usually non-renewable resource, the functionality of sensor networks must be viewed from low-power perspective. Medium access control (MAC) mechanism has a significant impact on the energy efficiency. Currently available MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks can be broken down into two major types: contention based and scheduling based. While under contention-based protocols nodes compete among each other for channel access, scheduling-based schemes rely on prearranged collisionfree links between nodes. In this paper we discuss a novel MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks, ALSMAC. The protocol achieves good scalability and collision avoidance by utilizing contention-based advertising slots mapped to scheduled-based transmission slots."

In this spaceborne/airborne experiment, receiver works in the inverse sliding spotlight mode while transmitter operates in the sliding spotlight mode to achieve a tradeoff between the azimuth scene size and azimuth resolution. Such a mode is generally called double sliding spotlight mode. Because of this especial double sliding mode, the echoed signal will have two characteristics. Firstly, both transmitter and receiver have the very small synthetic aperture time; secondly, the receiver works in the high squint mode while transmitter works in the small squint mode. According to these two characters, different approximation models are employed to simplify the slant range histories of transmitter and receiver into the second-order polynomial model. Based on the presented model, a two-dimensional space-variant point target reference spectrum (BPTRS) is derived."

Experiments show that the planar transformer with copper foil and Litz wire has the highest potential to fit in the final converter design.

The proposed technique introduces variety in the particles both in the sampling procedure and in the resampling step.

Its effectiveness is illustrated over an example for object tracking in video sequences and over the bearing only tracking problem."

We proposed higher order smoothing on homogeneous region and anisotropic regularization on directed region which encodes the preference of edge direction by smoothing along preferred direction only. Required regularization terms are combined in proposed anisotropic TV functional and controlled by relating parameters. We calculated relating parameters byutilizing structure tensor field. Also to reduce the computational cost, we previously estimated nonchanging pixels and exclude them from calculation for speed up. Experiments shown that, proposed method performs better with low computational cost than general purpose TV on text image."

As the size of the lexicon grows, the recognition accuracy falls sharply and is reported to be around 30% for a10K word lexicon.  The objective of this research is to raise the accuracy levels on unconstrained handwritten documents by reducing the size of lexicons. We present an innovative method of lexicon reduction by topic categorization of handwritten documents. After categorization of a document into a topic e.g. sports, science etc. we use smaller lexicons that include only words with high mutual information with that topic and hence increase performance of recognizers. In this paper we present different techniques and report results on a publicly available dataset."

If these errors are not corrected, some undesired effects will appear, such as loss of geometric resolution and radiometric accuracy, reduction of image contrast, azimuth ambiguities and strong phase distortions. In this paper we will work in the compensation of the motion errors for the hybrid experiment, this is, a combination of an airborne sensor with a spaceborne sensor."

The biggest part of the landmass will be covered twice with the same geometry (incidence and look angles) but two different baselines. This paper presents a new phase unwrapping algorithm which uses the two interferograms and combines global and local phase unwrapping. Both interferograms are first unwrapped independently with the Minimum Cost Flow algorithm, then unwrapping errors are found comparing the two phases and finally a region growing phase unwrapping algorithm is applied on all the wrong areas which exhibit significant discrepancies."

And when the distance from the source to the destination is long enough, the throughput of flow through multi-path is more than that with shortest single-path. And simulation shows the same result."

We test these methods on a real data set composed of word images extracted from an encyclopedia of the XIX-th Century. The word images are grouped on the basis of the clustering methods and subsequently retrieved identifying the closest clusters to a query word. The accuracy of the methods is compared evaluating the performance of the word retrieval algorithm. From the experimental results we conclude that methods designed to automatically determine the number and the structure of clusters, such as GHSOM, are particularly suitable in the context represented by our data set."

Combining active integration technologies, the proposed integrated ballast is projected to achieve doubled power density compared with the discrete implememtation. A prototype with integrated passive components was developed, and the preliminary experimental results show that the integrated ballast can achieve almost same electrical performance as the discrete ballast."

This paper highlights and discusses the current challenges of implementing large scale SNNs on reconfigurable FPGAs. The paper proposes a novel, large scale Field Programmable Neural Network (FPNN) architecture, incorporating low power analogue synapses and SNN neurons, interconnected using a Network on Chip architecture for SNN spike packet routing and SNN configuration. Initial results on the scalability of the proposed FPNN architecture are presented."

Modifications of the model based Freeman decomposition are used to decompose the scattering contributions and to invert the surface and dihedral scattering components for soil moisture estimation at C- and L-band. The applied decomposition approaches for agricultural land surfaces are suitable but indicate insufficiencies in modeling the volume and the dihedral components, even though some improvements due to the modifications could be shown. Finally this results in a soil moisture estimation which does not perform sufficiently well especially over the whole acquisition period."

The algorithm preserves the character of conventional PFA of separating 2D interpolation to two 1D interpolations.

Specifically, the all-weather imaging capability of the C-Band SAR (C-SAR) instrument carried by Sentinel-1 shall provide measurement data at high and medium resolutions for land, coastal zones and ice observations in cloudy regions and during night, coupled with radar interferometry capability for detection of small (millimetre or sub-millimetre level) ground movements, with the appropriate frequencies and operating modes required to support the GMES services. The SAR Antenna Subsystem (SAS) represents the sensor part of the C-SAR instrument and is an active phased array system with Tx and Rx gain and phase control distributed over the antenna area. These functions are provided by so called Transmit Receive Modules (TRMs) as part of the Electronic Frontend End (EFE) assemblies. The SAS is capable to perform rapid electronic beam steering, beam shaping, and also polarisation selection. The dual polarised antenna allows transmission in one single, but selectable polarisation (H or V) and simultaneous reception of both H and V polarisations. The electrical architecture of the SAS comprises equipment for DC power distribution, RF signal distribution, SAS control."

The approach adopts an intuitively appealing two step design procedure where firstly a linear controller is designed ignoring the inherent nonlinearities in the system. Quantitive feedback theory is used in this regard and provides pre-specified levels of robust stability and performance. In the second stage of the design process an AWBT controller is designed to account for hardware saturation constraints. This scheme is subsequently modified to account for feedback discrepancies due to a varying propagation environment, ensuring smooth handoff in the network. The proposed method is extensively tested on a fully compliant 802.15.4 wireless sensor testbed."

First, the initial reconstructed high-resolution image, which is similar to the original high-resolution image, is built under the POCS algorithm. Second, the residue compensation is estimated. The higher frequency information is reconstructed by learning two corresponding sets of high- and low- resolution training residue images. The optimal super-resolution face image, which has more image content, is hallucinated by compensating the residue to the initial reconstructed high-resolution image. Experiments demonstrate that our approach does render high quality super-resolution faces."

The particle-filter [6] based algorithm combines the benefits of variable-rate filtering [5] with a variable- dimension, manoeuvre-based representation of the target trajectory. Variable-rate filtering allows the algorithm to model manoeuvre changes at arbitrary (non-measurement) times, while manoeuvre-based modelling adds to track robustness by providing a parsimonious representation of the target trajectory. The efficiency of the particle filter has been greatly enhanced using reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo [7] moves that are applied in a Resample-Move fashion [4]. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on some example representative scenarios."

This was ahead of the original plan that included some calibration activities continuing into the early part of the Operational Phase. The RADARSAT-2 mission includes UltraFine, Spotlight and Quad-Polarization modes in addition to the heritage single beam and ScanSAR modes that were provided by RADARSAT-1. All heritage modes are also available with dual (co+cross) polarization combinations. The mission includes several hundred beams and modes and therefore required the development of methods and tools that would allow efficient calibration of groups of beams. The conference presentation will report on the SAR mode validation, image quality and calibration status. Information will be included on the techniques and procedures that were used, and the problems that were dealt with during commissioning."

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of tracking targets where each sensor in the network's view of the target is prone to obscuration due to other objects in the environment. An off-the-shelf multi-sensor tracker that attempts to localize (i.e. triangulate) targets moving through such a sensor network (for example, a CCTV network) assumes a fixed probability of detection for each sensor. This assumption is not valid when obscuration becomes pronounced and results in a degradation of performance. The tracker typically underestimates the probability of a track being present which causes premature track termination and thereby track fragmentation. One approach to countering this effect is to assume that a map of the environment is available and can be used to determine the probability of detection for any given hypothetical target position and given sensor position. This approach necessitates access to such a map, which may not be readily available. To address this issue, this paper build on the recent development of algorithms for estimating the probability of targets' existence (for track management) to propose a model that considers random variables associated with the time-varying inter-visibility of targets from sensors. We compare this proposed approach, the use of known maps and the use of off-the-shelf multi-sensor tracking algorithms using simulated data. Recommendations include the development of a framework for feedback to and from a perceived map, built up over time. The technical challenges associated with the robust sequential estimation of an unknown and fixed (or slowly varying) map are highlighted."

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. This paper presents a refinement calculus for service components. We model the behaviour of individual service by a guarded design, which enables one to separate the responsibility of clients from the commitment made by the system, and to identify a component by a set of failures and divergences. Protocols are introduced to coordinate the interactions between a component with the external environment. We adopt the notion of process refinement to formalize the substitutivity of components, and provide a complete proof method based on the notion of simulations."

Most characters on scene images appear with the same color and font size at every word or text line. In our algorithm, a scene image is divided into several blocks based on edges in the color space at first. Then the blobs, which consist of similar color pixels, are extracted by a clustering in a color space for each block. Although these blobs are correspond to characters or background patterns, after connecting them using these aspect ratios and pitches, SVM (Support Vector Machine) on several textural features of these blobs will classify each connected blob into character or background patterns. Testing with 251 images from ICDAR 2003 Text Locating Competition shows effectiveness of our algorithm."

In conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, PSO based PI controller for on-ramp metering is designed. Finally, the controller is simulated in MATLAB software. The result shows that the controller designed has fast response, and good dynamic and steady-state performance. This method has a good effect on freeway ramp metering."

A ground-based SAR system successfully demostrates the DBF SAR operation. The demostrator aquired SAR raw data with very dense spatial sampling rate in order to obtain various sampling rates. We evaluate DBF performancewith respect to the image quality factor with two different types of the beam former, a fixed-beam former and an adaptive beam former. The results show that an adaptive DBF algorithm offers a wide range of the selection of the pulse repetition frequency (PRF). In addtion we evaluate the noise performance compared to a reference mono-static SAR system on the same condition on single target experiment."

        "abstract": "Collectively moving object clusters are of particular interest in certain applications and have to be tracked as separate aggregated entities consisting of an unknown number of individuals. Tracking of convoys or large vehicles in wide area ground surveillance are practically important examples (GMTI: Ground Moving Target Indicator). In standard tracking algorithms, the objects of interest are usually considered as point source objects; i. e. compared to the sensor resolution their spatial extension is neglected. Due to the increasing resolution capabilities of modern sensors, however, different scattering centers of an extended object can cause distinct detections. In this sense also collectively moving object groups can be considered as extended objects. Due to the resulting data association and resolution conflicts, any attempt of tracking individual objects within the group is no longer reasonable. In this paper ellipsoidal object extensions are modeled by random matrices, which are treated as additional state variables to be estimated. An important aspect is the incorporation of context information into the Bayesian data processing formalism. We here consider kinematical constraints such as road maps and sensor specific characteristics such as Doppler-blindness."
