        "abstract": "The increasing interest in development, operation and integration of large amount of renewable energy resources like offshore wind farms and photovoltaic generation in deserts leads to an emerging demand on development of multi-terminal high voltage direct current (MTDC) systems. Due to preformed studies, voltage source converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) system is the best option for realising future multi-terminal HVDC system to integrate bulk amount of energy over long distances to the AC grid. The most important drawback of VSC-HVDC systems is their need for fast HVDC circuit breakers. This paper aims at summarizing HVDC circuit breakers technologies including recent significant attempts in development of modern HVDC circuit breaker. A brief functional analysis of each technology is presented. Additionally, different technologies based on derived information from literatures are compared. Finally, recommendations for improvement of circuit breakers are presented.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring critical temperatures in electric motors is crucial for preventing shortened motor life spans due to excessive thermal stress. With regard to permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM), critical temperatures can occur in the magnets and the stator end winding. While excessive magnet temperatures involve the risk of irreversible demagnetization when operating the motor in flux weakening mode, exceeding the thermal limits of the stator windings can destroy the insulation varnish. As directly measuring temperatures, especially on the rotating part, is costly and thus not applicable with respect to automotive applications, model-based approaches are preferred. In this paper, a low-order thermal model for accurate temperature predictions in the permanent magnets, the windings and the end windings is introduced. The model parameters are estimated solely based on experimental data via a sequence of interdependent identification steps. The model performance is validated by experimental results based on a high-speed PMSM typically used as traction motor in subcompact electric cars.",

        "abstract": "Memory motor has been researched extensively in the last decade due to its online magnetization capability. Among many types of designs, hybrid magnet memory motor (HMMM) has highest torque density. This paper investigates the cross coupling effect of HMMM in the motor topology proposed by Sakai. The analysis model is introduced firstly. Based on the magnetic circuit model, the mechanism of opencircuit cross coupling effect is investigated while the ideal condition for eliminating this effect is proposed. Later, the on-load cross coupling effect is also analysed by both magnetic circuit model and 2D FEA focusing on coercive force (Hc) of magnet and interaction between two types of magnets as well as magnetic saturation. Meanwhile, the magnetization characteristics are calculated as well. The results show that increasing Hc of low coercive force (LCF) magnet can reduce the cross coupling effect but increase the difficulty of online magnetization. Therefore, a trade-off exists for choosing proper LCF magnet in HMMM.",

Using our own packaging technology of double-sided cooling and SiC devices, we have developed the new, small 6-in-1 power module with high output power density. If the inductance of the main circuit is large, it will cause a large surge voltage when switched. Therefore, we have incorporated the optimum low inductance structure into this module, and have made it possible to drive the SiC device at high speed. Using this module, we have built a prototype of inverter unit with 75 kW output power, and have achieved an efficiency of 99% and a power density of 100 kW/L.",

Therefore, active power cycling tests with a variation of load pulse duration were conducted. The requirements for the active power cycling test equipment related to load pulse durations down to 70ms will be discussed. The analysis of the test results leads to the proposal of a new empirical lifetime model for advanced power modules, which explicitly contains the impact of the load pulse duration. These reliability results will affect the design of advanced inverters with low frequency output currents.",

The converter is based on a dual-interleaved topology with hard-switching operating at 75 kHz. To increase the power density, water-cooled magnetic components are used. The experimental results of a 60 kW converter show the potential to increase the operating frequencies up to 100 kHz and beyond in this application.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in military and civilian fields, which promotes the need of networking. Due to the complex features of UAV MANET, the development of UAV MANET faces many technical challenges, such as routing. Generally speaking, Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol gives better performance on delay compare to AODV protocol, so the OLSR protocol meets the high demand for real-time of UAV communication. High mobility and load imbalanced are two significant characteristics of UAV networks. The performance of UAV networks is largely affected by these characteristics. In order to reduce the effects of these problems, a Mobility and Load aware OLSR (ML-OLSR) protocol is proposed in this paper. The mobility-aware algorithm and load-aware algorithm are introduced to the OLSR protocol. The modelling and simulation of the ML-OLSR protocol was completed within QualNet simulator. Simulation results show that ML-OLSR outperforms the original OLSR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio and average end-to-end delay.",

IoT will be applied in different areas, e.g. smart cities, agriculture, energy, environment protection, health, home automation, etc. However, if different IoT applications are based on different architectures, this will prevent the IoT co-building, convergence, and openness. To reduce investments in the IoT area, a top-down architectural principles need to be followed to unify the design. This paper provides classification of the IoT platforms and proposes a top-level generic IoT architecture particularly suited for the creation of smart cities.",

This topology provides an active balancing of the cells in addition to the control of the propulsion motor, thus integrating into the same controller also the function of a battery management system. This paper analyses the possibilities for stationary recharge of the batteries both from a three phase and a single phase AC source. Charging operations are demonstrated by numerical simulations on a model of an electric city car.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a modified staircase modulation is proposed which enables more efficient use of the DC link voltage. This is very preferable feature for HVDC transmission systems as the 15% lower DC link voltage can be used (lower number of cells). In the second part of the paper the capacitor balancing of modular multilevel converter (MMC) converter is investigated. Balancing becomes a significant issue when the number of the converter levels is high. For instance, with a 401-level MMC converter, the converter comprises 400 cells per arm per phase. This means that 2400 capacitors have to be measured and fed back to the controller for balancing. The system will not be only impractical but also unreliable and complex. A new capacitor balancing strategy is proposed to enhance the system reliability and eliminate the capacitor voltage sensors. A simple example of 7-level converter is presented to explain basic principles of the proposed technique. The proposed method performance is validated by studying a 21-level MMC based VSC-HVDC system.",

        "abstract": "One of the responses to the increasing penetration of renewable energies along with the growth in electricity demand is the interest in the construction of multi-terminal DC grids (MTDC), as mean to connect onshore AC systems with remotely located offshore wind energy sources. This paper investigates the current methodologies for MTDC control stating their limitations for severe contingency conditions and proposes a control strategy able to ensure grid reliability and voltage stability in the case of a sudden outage of the converter station controlled in Vdc-Q. This strategy, acting on the Vdc reference signal, allows the presence of multiple master converters in the DC grid. A five-terminal DC scheme, which connects onshore AC systems with offshore wind farms, has been developed in RT-Lab Simulator. Each sub-station (terminal) is equipped with a modular multilevel converter (MMC). The converters are either Vdc-Q controlled (master stations) or are P-Q (with droop control) or Vac-frequency regulated. The dynamic response of the system is observed after a converter outage to assess the validity of the proposed DC voltage control strategy.",

        "abstract": "Power converters in grid connection applications commonly employ Sinusoidal Pulse-Width Modulation (SPWM) technique. Passive filters are employed in order to attenuate the generated switching current ripples and reduces resonances between the grid and the inverter. The first-order (L), the second-order (LC), and the third-order (LCL) filters topologies are typical filters for grid connected Voltage Source Inverters (VSI). Practically, due to the system size, weight, and cost requirements, the LCL filter is the most commonly used among others for the integration of the three phase VSI into the grid. However, the control system stability is affected by the underdamping characteristic of the LCL filter therefore, it introduces to challenges to the control problem. Numerous control strategies such as repetitive, predictive, multiloop control, and hysteresis regulation have been proposed in order to improve the stability of the grid-connected VSIs. In this paper, the performance of the third order LCL filter-based gridconnected three-phase VSI is evaluated and the system stability is investigated using a two-loop control approach with both passive and active damping. The two-loop control considers the grid current as the outer loop while for the inner loop, different variables are considered such as capacitor voltage, capacitor current, and inductor current.",

        "abstract": "Battery energy storage systems have traditionally been manufactured using new batteries with a good reliability. The high cost of such a system has led to investigations of using second life transportation batteries to provide an alternative energy storage capability. However, the reliability and performance of these batteries is unclear and multi-modular power electronics with redundancy have been suggested as a means of helping with this issue. This paper reviews work already undertaken on battery failure rate to suggest suitable figures for use in reliability calculations. The paper then uses reliability analysis and a numerical example to investigate six different multi-modular topologies and suggests how the number of series battery strings and power electronic module redundancy should be determined for the lowest hardware cost using a numerical example. The results reveal that the cascaded dc-side modular with single inverter is the lowest cost solution for a range of battery failure rates.",

        "abstract": "Voltage Source Converter (VSC) HVDC transmission is receiving significant attention as the UK is trying to meet its renewable energy targets. However, VSC-HVDC is more vulnerable to DC faults compared to more traditional CSCHVDC transmission techniques, due to the low DC side impedances and sensitive power electronics within the converters. This paper investigates the two-level converter system response under different fault scenarios, i.e., pole-to-pole and pole-to-ground faults. A point-to-point two-level VSC-HVDC system was developed in PSCAD/EMTDC to evaluate the system fault response and to verify the theoretical analysis. The study details the system response of the DC side and AC side to pole-to-pole and pole-to-ground faults. The paper details parameters which are considered to be fundamental in the design of a DC protection system. This work is sponsored by National Grid.",

        "abstract": "A large exploiting of renewables in islanded systems can become more and more interesting, both referring to the disconnection of portions of developed distribution networks and to the first electrification of rural areas. A control strategy able to coordinate the different resources of islanded systems, aiming to preserve voltage and frequency stability, is needed. Differently from other works, the authors have developed an approach able to coordinate active and reactive generation output with storage systems requirements and features, making no use of remote communications between different points of the system. The control strategy acts on frequency and voltage in order to reduce as much as possible the power exchanges between the storage system and the network. This means involving mainly generators in supplying load requirements. In this way, the storage system can provisionally compensate significant events in terms of active and reactive balance, as shown in the reported simulations.",

Simulation tools capable of analyzing EMAs performance and exploring different design configurations facilitate such a process. In this context, a virtual testing and analysis tool for EMAs, developed within the framework of the European project Actuation 2015, is presented. The proposed tool addresses the electric drives components (i.e. permanent magnet machines and power converters) and has been implemented using Modelica, as modelling language, and Dymola, as simulation environment. In order to minimize the models complexity, a multi-level approach has been adopted. In this paper, an overview of the physical effects considered at each model level is provided, together with the analysis of an EMA study case. The presented simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed virtual testing and analysis tool.",

        "abstract": "Thermal design and modelling in electrical machines is important because it allows a proper choice of materials, avoids de-rating of the machine and eliminates excessive safety factors thus achieving higher current densities. In high current density electrical machines, particularly those making use of liquid cooled housing jackets for heat removal, the stator to housing thermal contact resistance is on the main heat removal path of the electrical machine. So far it has always been assumed that this parameter is dependent on the shrink fit manufacturing procedure of the machine. However this paper provides experimental evidence showing that the thermal contact resistance not only varies with shrink fit pressure but is also affected by heat flux and temperature. Hence the common notion that the thermal contact resistance is a constant value set during the machine assembly, and that during thermal design this value can be applied across the whole operating range of the machine is an over simplification. The paper presents arbitrary correlations showing the variation of thermal contact resistance with heat flux and shrink fit pressure and compares the measured values with values quoted in the literature.",

SiC has been identified as a potential technology to improve the efficiency of these converters. To analyse the semiconductor losses, this paper presents the semiconductor loss equations for the two-level converter (2LC), three-level neutral point clamped converter (3LNPCC) and the three-level T-Type converter (3LTTC). Based on the equations and current datasheet information, it is identified that SiC technology offers significant reductions in losses compared with traditional Si devices. The paper also discusses a number of hybrid device combinations to achieve the benefits of high efficiency in SiC technology and low cost of Si technology. Based on the semiconductor losses the converter efficiencies in the SiC 2LC and the 3LTTCs are about 3-4 % higher than in the Si 2LC for a 42 kW three phase converter operating at a 25 kHz switching frequency.",

To address this issue, a systematic approach has been suggested in this paper to compensate for the network latency in the application of synchrophasor assisted wide area control for the Static Var Compensator (SVC). The power oscillation modes are estimated online in presence of packet drop in a communication network. The modes are monitored through a modified Modified Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) approach. The time delay has been compensated by predicting the dynamics of the delayed measurement signal. A network control system model has been developed incorporating the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), event driven communication network and network buffers to mimic the response of a real time communication based control. The wide-area stabilizing controller has been designed based on Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy approach. The performance of the proposed delay compensation scheme has been tested on 39-bus New England system.",

The proposed model can reproduce the instantaneous torque waveform at any load condition, and hence provides a more accurate means of reluctance torque evaluation compared with the conventional methods.",

        "abstract": "The definition of ideal city, conceived at the turn of the 19th century and finalised at the turn of 21st as smart city, and based on six key smart components including economy, governance, people, science and technology, living and environment, ignores such a fundamental component as built environment, which constitutes the physical platform of a smart city. Indicators used for evaluation of smart city models mainly based on ICT platform do not include build environment characteristics. Proposed seven smart components system (7SCCS) structured in this paper, considers the built environment as a foundation of the smart city infrastructure. Critical reviews of the theory emphasize a leading role of the ICT in the development of smart cities and, at present, the theory is winning a growing support from many experts and ICT organisations and companies. However, the ICT-led model together with business-led models may produce negative effects on interface dynamics of smart cites components system. Review of elements of the contemporary built infrastructure proposes a strategy of balanced development of existing and emerging structures, and building those types of smart cities that are required for sustainable urban development of future cities.",

        "abstract": "The hybrid-excited switched-flux permanent magnet machines (HESFPMMs) have the potential for many applications, such as electric vehicles and aerospace. However, in the flux weakening region, it is usually difficult to determine the excitation current, while the extra copper loss due to field excitation may cause significant reduction in the machine performance especially efficiency. Therefore, a new control strategy for the HESFPMMs, which can operate in both flux-enhancing and flux-weakening regions, has been proposed. It utilises a novel feature of HESFPMMs in which the flux produced by the permanent magnets can be inherently shortcircuited via the iron flux-bridges. Hence, in this proposed method, the field excitation current is set to zero in order to avoid the copper loss of the field winding in the flux weakening region. Meanwhile, it utilizes the voltage difference between the command and real voltages, and does not require the machine parameters to modify the excitation current reference in flux-enhancing mode and the d-axis current reference in flux-weakening mode. In addition, in order to improve the tracking accuracy of the excitation current, the current feedback control is employed. As a result, the proposed method can provide a smooth speed transition from flux-enhancing mode to flux-weakening mode. It is verified by the experiments and can also be implemented for other hybrid-excited machines.",

        "abstract": "A supercapacitor-based energy storage control scheme for elevator motor drives that exhibits improved performance and maximum exploitation of the storage device is proposed in this paper. The suggested energy storage system is connected to the dc-link of an elevator motor drive through a bidirectional dc-dc converter and the braking energy is stored at the supercapacitor bank. Aim of the control scheme is to ensure power supply to the elevator motor as possible from the temporary stored energy of the supercapacitors, in order to minimize the power consumption from the grid. Also, since the capacitance of the supercapacitor and consequently the energy storage capability reduces with increasing frequency, the proposed control scheme aims to provide smooth charging and discharging performance. This is attained by optimally controlling the dc-dc power converter through a new control technique that takes into account any variations of the ac supply voltage to the elevator motor drive and also on-line adjusting the dc-link voltage Proportional-Integral (PI) controller parameters according to the elevator operating conditions. Several simulation results are presented to demonstrate the resulting improvements of the suggested control scheme.",

Power loss reduction also intends with the proposed UPFC controller. The UPFC's shunt and series controllers are developed based on D-Q fuzzy logic (FL) controller, which has been designed in PSCAD environment as an independent module. The proposed UPFC controller is tested by using IEEE-5 and 14 bus systems. The performance of D-Q fuzzy based UPFC reveals better improvement compared to PI based UPFC in terms of power flow control and power loss reduction.",

The primary purpose of the control strategy is to ensure that power balance can be maintained between the AC- and DC-terminals of the AAC. Therefore, the sub-module capacitor voltages can remain regulated. A set of simulation results for a line-line fault is presented.",

        "abstract": "More-electric aircraft architectures are a well-known approach to reduce the environmental impact of air transport as well as to improve on fuel efficiency. Specifically, electric actuation of flight control surfaces is also seen as an effective way to improve aircraft efficiency while reducing operational cost. Electromechanical actuators (EMA) for flight control surfaces are complex components and a thorough and integrated optimisation of the EMA is required in order to be competitive with existing hydraulic solutions. In this context, this paper presents details of the design optimisation of a fault-tolerant permanent magnet (PM) motor drive for an aerospace application, in particular for an EMA in a helicopter primary flight control application. Emphasis is put on the integrated weight optimisation of the whole motor drive. The fault-tolerant EMA actuation system is described in detail and the design and optimisation of the dual channel, fault-tolerant electrical machine and the power converter within the EMA structure is presented. Prototypes of the electrical machines and the power converters were manufactured and measurement results are presented, validating the models used in the optimisation process.",

        "abstract": "Future distribution networks consist of some Micro grids (MGs) or Small Scale Energy Zones (SSEZs). In this paper the economic operation of SSEZs is formulated and solved as an optimization problem. A probabilistic model for Small Scale Energy Resources (SSERs) and load demand is used at each SSEZs to determine the optimal scheduling of microgrids with minimum operating cost. The power transaction between MGs and between MGs and the main is regulated based on the total operating cost and regarding the sold or purchase power either by microgrids or by main grid. The stochastically analysis of generated power with SSERs and their corresponding costs is determined considering optimization constraints and explained as PDF and CDF. The Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm are applied to comparative study of the results as optimization algorithms. Based on the results, it is possible to determine the power demand and transaction between each SSEZs and the main grid. Besides, the results confirm that the power sharing between microgrids and main grid can decrease the operating cost of the smart distribution grids.",

        "abstract": "The ever evolving technology of the Internet of Things(IoT) requires ubiquitous connectivity to billions of heterogeneous devices such as sensors, cameras, RFID devices, etc. However, due to the heterogeneity of devices and access protocols, IoT networks are becoming enormous and complex, which makes the management extremely difficult. Based on Machine-to-Machine(M2M) technics and the programmability feature of the network, brought by the Software Defined Network(SDN), devices in a network can be treated as objects, thus decoupling the control plane from the data plane. In this paper, we proposed a framework for managing the devices and configuring the network dynamically based on SDN. Finally, we apply the framework in our project and get a successful result.",

        "abstract": "Currently, low power wind system is an important research topic, it has a large socioeconomic appeal, because it is a renewable, clean, sustainable and alternative source of electric energy. The electricity production by low power wind systems can be implemented in several places, such as homes, telecommunications towers, oil rigs, schools and rural clinics with a good profitability over time. However, the popularization of renewable energy in low scale depends on new solutions to provide simple, robust and cost-effective systems. Aiming this scenario, this paper proposes a system that enables the connection between small wind turbines and the mains, based on a passive rectifier, DC-DC buck converter and push-pull inverter. The proposed system was analysed, designed and verified for a 1kW small wind turbine.",

However so far no dynamic state estimator considers the state constraints like zeros injection constraints in power system. In this paper, a new dynamic state estimator based on the projected unscented Kalman filter (PUKF) is presented. It is based on the application of unscented transformation and estimate-projection combined with the Kalman filter theory. The proposed method can improve the approximation of power system nonlinearity and guarantee that the estimated state vectors obey zeros injection constraints. Four tests for different conditions including normal operating condition, gross bad data condition, sudden load change condition and topology error condition are taken to verify the performance of the proposed method.",

The conversion system consists of an asymmetrical six-phase induction generator supplied by four voltage source converters (VSCs) in a hybrid series/parallel configuration. Post-fault operation must preserve the current ratings of the system and should also maximize the generated power by means of a proper flux adjustment. Both requirements are achieved in this work using a non-linear optimization analysis and some modifications in the control scheme. Simulation results confirm the optimal and safe performance of the wind energy system under study.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a current-source converter based unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) is used for a fixed-speed induction generator (FSIG) wind turbines in order to enhance the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability. When voltage sag occurs due to grid side fault, the series compensator of the UPQC injects required voltage to prevent disconnecting of FSIG wind turbine. On the other hand, faults produced by wind turbine generator systems will impact not only the wind farms but also the interconnected system including the grid if proper protection is not ensured. Therefore, the resistive SFCL incorporated in series with the dc-link inductance of UPQC is proposed to limit excessive current in the event of the generator side fault. Detailed simulation studies implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC confirm that both of resistive SFCL and large dc-link inductance are effective in decreasing the fault current thereby reducing the voltage dip at the generator terminal.",

The reason lies in the stall of SPIMs caused by low voltage. During stalling, a SPIM can withdraw as high as three times of its rated power. This phenomenon can cause many problems including the loss of critical load due to the action of protection devices. This paper explores the role of reactive power support during MG islanding and proposes a novel approach to managing the reactive power generation of electronic-interfaced distributed generators (EIDGs). The concept of sensitivity factors is used in the proposed algorithm for regulating voltages at weak load buses. The optimal sharing of reactive power among EIDGs is formulated as a linear programming problem, which can be solved in a very fast manner for real-time control purpose. The proposed method is validated on a MG test-bed evolved from the IEEE standard 13-bus test feeder.",

        "abstract": "Hardware Trojan has emerged as an impending security threat to many critical systems. However, detecting hardware Trojan is extremely difficult due to Trojans are always triggered by rare events. Side-channel signal analysis is effective in detecting Trojan but facing the challenge with process variation and environment noise in nanotechnology. Moreover, side-channel approaches that analyze global signals cannot scale well to large circuits. This paper presents a heuristic partition and test pattern generation based localized signal analysis method for hardware Trojan detection. First, we partition the design into regions controlled by scan chains. Then a test vector ordering algorithm is used to generate optimized vectors which can magnify the activity in the target region where Trojan may be located. At last, power ports are placed in each region to measure the localized transient current anomalies for Trojan detection, while a signal calibration technique is used to eliminate the negative effect of process variation and noise. We evaluate our approach on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits and the results show that the proposed scheme can magnify the detection sensitivity in multiples from the state-of-the-art. Two further benefits of this method are that it can scale well to large circuits and determine Trojan's location.",

These features are then used to train a Support Vector Machine for classification, i.e., to differentiate between HIF and switching events. Test results based on data obtained simulations on a prototype feeder show that the method is effective in identifying HIFs.",

        "abstract": "The shunt large capacitor, on both sides of voltage source converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) transmission lines, will rapidly discharge to the fault point when a fault occurs. The system side can be equivalent to the shunt large capacitance in the fault component model. According to this characteristic of the VSC-HVDC system, a novel pilot protection scheme for VSC-HVDC transmission lines based on parameter identification is proposed in this paper. The protection principle can distinguish internal faults from external faults by identifying the capacitance on two terminals with the time-domain algorithm. The capacitance on two terminals can be accurately identified simultaneously when an internal fault occurs, while the capacitance at both ends cannot be accurately identified simultaneously when an external fault occurs. Therefore, a pilot protection criterion is constructed. The simulation results show that the protection scheme can distinguish internal faults from external faults reliably and quickly, and it is not affected by transition resistance, distributed capacitance of lines, and the control mode. In addition, the method can be implemented easily with simple computation and has certain practical value.",

        "abstract": "The performance of an induction machine (IM), whose stator windings have been designed by using fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) technique, is investigated. Well known several advantages of FSCWs, including higher slot fill factor, better flux-weakening capability, higher power density, non-overlapping end turns, higher efficiency, are attempted to bring in IMs. However, detailed performance analyses including 3-phase short circuit fault analysis of the IMs designed with FSCWs have not been addressed in literature. In order to reveal the potential merits and demerits of the FSCWs when used in IMs, a conventional slot distributed winding (CSDW) IM having the same rated output values has also been designed and all results obtained from simulation have been compared. The comparison includes detailed machine dimensions, weights, magnetic flux density and line distributions, losses, efficiency, torque-speed curves, torque ripple levels, and also magnitude of forces acting on the stator and rotor windings under the steady-state and fault conditions. All simulations have been built in ANSYS Maxwell® electromagnetic field simulation software based on finite element method. This study will assist in answering lots of the questions raised about the advantages and disadvantages of using FSCWs in the IMs.",

The Monte Carlo (MC) method was adopted to understand the impact of diversity of demand on LV feeders and especially the effect of uncontrolled human behaviour. The statistical models of EV demand and HP demand were established and a simulation study was carried out in both balanced and unbalanced scenarios. Moreover, the effectiveness of the TOU tariff on mitigating the violations of the voltage limits caused by EVs and HPs was investigated and the result shows that the TOU tariff helps to shorten the violation time period but may induce a new violation period.",

With the increasing of installation capacity, it is important to gather knowledge about proper utilization of the photovoltaic technology. The output efficiency and performance of PV system are influenced by many factors, such as solar tracking system, solar angle, shading or partial shading, dust and cell operating temperature. A few numbers of studies has been carried out about the effect of these factors on the practical operation of the PV system. It is very essential to take proper step to optimize the effect of these factors to get the maximum performance from PV technology. In this study, the impact of different factors that influence on PV power generation has been reviewed comprehensively and added the suggestions for the system so that maximum performance and efficiency can be achieved by the solar photovoltaic system.",

A continuous consumption optimization algorithm has been improved in order to better manage the shifted demand. It has been done in a simulation and user-interaction tool capable of being integrated in a multiagent smart grid simulator already developed, and also capable of integrating several optimization algorithms to manage real and simulated loads. The case study of this paper enhances the advantages of the proposed algorithm and the benefits of using the developed simulation and user interaction tool.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) for automotive traction applications. The electromagnetic and mechanical simulation results of the proposed motor are presented for operation at 50,000 rpm. The SRM is designed to withstand the rotor stresses due to the centrifugal force whilst producing an output power of 60kW. The simulation results confirm that the stresses forced on the rotor in the proposed topology are below the yield strength of the material with a safety factor of 1.2. Fatigue life may be an issue and will be investigated in the future. The high speed operation allows for a smaller overall size, which in turn leads to lower manufacturing costs. This combined with high output power makes this design a good candidate for use in mass production hybrid electric vehicles.",

The analysis is based on the Cigré DC-grid test system, which is designed to resemble a generalized future configuration of multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) systems. The small-signal stability of the system is investigated to identify critical modes associated with different parts of the interconnected AC and DC power systems. The analysis is presented in several steps in order to identify interaction problems and critical modes that can occur with different typical system configurations. Firstly, a case with point-to-point HVDC connection is analysed, followed by the analysis of a four-terminal DC system, before the stability of the entire Cigré DC grid configuration is studied. The state variables participating in critical modes, and the parameter sensitivities of these modes are identified and discussed. The obtained results illustrate particular challenges that can occur during a step-wise construction of a large-scale MTDC transmission system.",

        "abstract": "Many Industrial drives include rectifier-inverter systems. For its simplicity, the voltage source inverter (VSI) is usually used. But, with the on-line generation of carrier based gating signal, the duality between VSI and CSI is extended. Accordingly, feedback control strategies with voltage source inverter, (VSI) such as vector control technique can be applicable with CSI. Moreover, the problems encountered with VSI and its effect on the machine can be avoided. This paper introduces a vector controlled five phase induction motor fed from five-phase PWM-CSI. The input dc-link current to the inverter is the output from a controlled three-phase rectifier through a calculated reference dc-link current from the inverter side. MATLAB/SIMULINK is used as an assessment tool for the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new generation SiC MOSFET based avionic power supply. Efficient use of energy and materials and a drastic reduction of greenhouse emissions and noise footprints are the key motivations behind the more electric aircraft. In one of such aircraft electrical systems, the main DC bus is generally kept at 270V and many critical and bidirectional loads require 28V input. Hence, an efficient bidirectional DC-DC converter is required for this purpose. Dual active bridge with HF transformer isolation is one of the best choices for such applications. Another important aspect in avionic systems is to reduce the size and weight of the system. By increasing the DC-DC converter operating frequency the size of the magnetic components can be reduced. However, this is achieved with the increased switching losses and associated cooling requirements. The recent advancements in SiC device technology have helped to improve the switching performance and allowed the operation at higher temperature without degradation of its performance. Simulation and experimental evaluations of 1kW lab-prototype are presented.",

        "abstract": "In such new distribution grid structures, protection schemes employed in mature grid have started to change caused by the unpredictable nature of renewable generation units. Thus, the protection devices and relevant control methodologies should dynamically be adapted to changing power flow and fault conditions within the grid system. The protection issue in smart distribution grids with additional DG units is a complex problem that should be considered and analyzed carefully for promoting the reliability and security of power supply. In this paper, a study on the protection recommendations and analysis of the various fault scenarios for DG based distribution systems will be realized. The IEEE 13 bus test system will be utilized in the mentioned study. Different case studies including the possibilities of multiple DGs in several locations within the grid structure will be evaluated under fault conditions. The short circuit analysis and suggestions for improving protection performance are included. The relevant modeling actions and simulations are implemented in Matlab/Simulink.",

A strategy is proposed to manage fault-tolerant operation and the reconfiguration procedure, using minimal hardware expansion. This strategy includes diagnosis and tolerance solutions for IGBT open-circuit faults in both inverter and rectifier stages, thus guaranteeing a continuous operation of the motor and the maintenance of sinusoidal currents and unity power factor supply after the occurrence of a fault. Special attention is given to the reconfiguration procedure. Simulation results are included to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed strategies.",

        "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy is becoming an increasingly important part of the world's renewable energy. To enhance energy conversion efficiency, bypass diodes have been used in PV systems. The usage of bypass diodes is particularly effective when a PV system is under an uneven shading condition. However, shading is normally applied to a PV array in very random manners, making shading analysis and improvement contributed by the bypass diodes extremely hard to access. This paper performs a comprehensive study on the PV array energy extraction characteristics under a variety of shading conditions. Based on the study, an enhanced bypass diode design in terms of doping concentration is proposed. Investigation of the proposed bypass diode scheme shows that such bypass diode design is effective in improving energy capture efficiency under diverse shading conditions. Significant simulation studies are conducted for detailed evaluation of a PV system with the different bypass diode schemes and process.",

        "abstract": "Modern power systems employ various information and communication network technologies to serve end-users more efficiently and with acceptable levels of reliability. The cyber network is categorized as a digital communication network, so it intrinsically follows similar regulations, as well as faults and failures. A data communication system is a chain of components stretching from a data source to its destination. Like a chain, each component must accomplish its assigned tasks adequately. Nevertheless, this novel technology has introduced new groups of failures that are conceptually different from those of traditional power networks. Power system reliability studies must consider the failure modes and repair strategies of the cyber network. This paper investigates cyber-power network failures and proposes a novel, all-inclusive categorization of failures that have the potential to threaten the power system's proper operation. Microgrids and automated substations are two well-known cyber-power networks that could benefit from the proposed study.",

GaN devices have a much lower gate charge and lower output capacitance and, therefore, are capable of operating at a switching frequency 10 times of that of the silicon MOSFET. This might significantly impact the power density, form factor and even the current design and manufacturing practice.",

The proposed technique is based on the Fast Fourier Transform of the stator instantaneous reactive power. The effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic method to detect these faults is evaluated by extensive experimental tests that were performed for different generator operating conditions, namely for different values of the active and reactive power injected into the grid and different values of the rotor speed. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is appropriate for the identification and quantification of the faults under study.",

The power switch is a parallel array of 21 fractionally rated Si MOSFET devices which current share to achieve the overall rating while minimising on-state losses. A transient voltage suppressor is used to dissipate inductive energy and protect the power switching devices. Results analysing onstate losses, thermal performance, inrush current limiting, inductive load breaking, and over-current response times are discussed.",

        "abstract": "When a converter is used to interface an ac distribution system and a low voltage (LV) dc micro-grid, several combined options for ac and for dc grounding can be used. According to the selected grounding scheme, zero-sequence dc or high frequency currents may flow in specific sections of the circuit. These, in turn, can cause EMC issues, unwanted protection trips and other problems. In the present article a dc micro-grid in which the neutral point of the MV/LV transformer is directly grounded and the dc micro-grid is floating (i.e., there is no grounding connection) is analysed. When a ground fault occurs, potentially harmful fault currents flow through the front-end converter, depending on the fault resistance and on the load conditions. The methodology proposed in this work protects the front-end converter while the task of feeding the dc-side loads is committed to storage systems. The calculation of the minimum fault resistance that the front-end converter can tolerate is provided and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is tested by means of numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "The application of IEC 61850 brings significant changes to the instrumentation, monitoring, communication, control and protection systems used in the substation automation system (SAS). Compared with the conventional substation system, the implementation of IEC 61850 provides more flexibility in SAS architectures, but it also raises concerns about the reliability and performance of the overall system. This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the reliability of an all-digital substation considering different topologies of both the station and process buses. The proposed reliability evaluation procedure is based on analytical Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) approach and stochastic Monte Carlo simulation method. This reliability analysis, combined with sensitive analysis, would help indicate the most reliable Substation Communication Network (SCN) architecture to realize a specific communication service. It would also help determine the weak points needed to be improved in order to improve the overall reliability of the automation system.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a duty cycle prediction scheme to be used in model predictive control (MPC) to minimize both torque and flux ripples of an induction motor (IM) drive. The duty cycle is predicted using the model of the IM, whereas analytical calculations are used in all of the prior duty cycle control methods. To minimize both torque and flux ripples, two different cost functions are used: one for voltage vector selection and another one for duty cycle prediction. Since the selection of the cost function in MPC is not a straightforward task, the proposed control strategy reduces the dependency on the selection of cost function while minimizing torque and flux ripples significantly. The commutation frequency of inverter is also reduced. Simulation results have revealed that, the proposed controller reduces the torque ripple and average switching frequency by 56% and 21%, respectively while keeping the flux performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides a novel and efficient method for predicting potential customer churn from imbalanced data set of Orange Telecom and UCI. Customer churn is always a rare event, but it is necessary to be paid attention. The main intended contribution of this paper is to apply binary logistic regression model (LRM), which seldom be used in the problem of imbalanced data prediction. The parameters estimated for the data gathered with serious problem of imbalance, therefore we take stratified sampling method, and improve traditional logistic regression model parameters estimated methods. The experimental results show that our prediction method performs satisfactorily, and it can be effective to forecast the telecom customer churn.",

        "abstract": "This paper studying starting, synchronization and steady state characteristics of five line start interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (LSIPMSMs). The overall performance of new and conventional types of LSIPMSMs with different rotor magnet shapes is analyzed and compared. All the proposed LSIPMSMs are with the same squirrel cage design, materials, stator and rotor slots geometry and stator winding design. In addition, the permanent magnets of all the motors have the same dimensions and are made from the same material. The starting and synchronization of the motors is studied under no load, full load, and high inertia. In steady state operation, the performance of the LSIPMSMS fed from sinusoidal is analyzed. The efficiency, power factor and torque ripples values are computed and compared under different load torque values. Two-dimension time steeping finite element method (FEM) is employed in analysis of the performance of LSIPMSMs.",

Whereas PD measurements used to be performed in factory or off-line only, there is now a strong trend to apply the technique also on-line. We have now reached a stage where PD measurement and analysis are proposed more and more as tools to ensure reliability of the modern (smart) grids. In this paper, developments in on-line monitoring of PD will be described and the important steps in performing such on line measurements will be identified. Further, the benefits are shown of implementing this technique for smart grid reliability.",

Such an approach is opposed to the traditional raw materials harvesting that is the norm, which in the majority of cases leads to the destruction of serviceable parts together with all other non-recycling materials. This paper presents a novel photovoltaic system suitable for disparate population centres in the developing world utilising repurposed components from discarded computer power supplies.",

In the literature, many techniques have been proposed to deal with such failures in order to support continuous network operation. One of these techniques defines p-Cycles which provide ring-type protection and the speed of restoration of meshes. Morever, Flex grid networks emerged as a solution to deal with the diverse requirements of bandwidth. This paper presents two new algorithms to provide path protection using p-cycle path networks in Flex grid networks. Our algorithms provide 100% protection against single failure as well as against two failures.",

This can be accomplished by charging the storage during off-peak time periods, when electricity energy prices are low, and discharging it during times when on-peak energy prices are applied. This article addresses the question whether it is economically viable to install medium-scale distributed storage devices in the power system designed to lower the electricity cost for a customer-side application, assuming flexible electricity tariffs. The technical/economical evaluation is carried out referring to Lithium ion (Li-ion), Sodium Sulphur (NaS) and Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) technologies, performing a parametric analysis by changing the capital cost of the batteries and the difference between the maximum and minimum electricity price. A case study is performed to show the advantages/disadvantages of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "The twenty-first century has seen the rise of a new type of video games targeted at a mass audience of “casual” gamers. Many of these games require the player to swap items in order to form matches of three and are collectively known as tile-matching match-three games. Among these, the most influential one is arguably Bejeweled in which the matched items (gems) pop and the above gems fall in their place. Bejeweled has been ported to many different platforms and influenced an incredible number of similar games. Very recently one of them, named Candy Crush Saga enjoyed a huge popularity and quickly went viral on social networks. We generalize this kind of games by only parameterizing the size of the board, while all the other elements (such as the rules or the number of gems) remain unchanged. Then, we prove that answering many natural questions regarding such games is actually NP-Hard. These questions include determining if the player can reach a certain score, play for a certain number of turns, and others. We also provide a playable web-based implementation of our reduction, which is accessible at http://candycrush.isnphard.com.",

        "abstract": "To compensate for the phase fluctuation of the arriving wave that experiences many reflections off conducting surfaces, a wireless communication method using a polarization rotating wave is proposed. The proposed method reduce the phase fluctuation by adaptively controlling the polarization rotating frequency. The proposed method is applied to stochastic models of communication, when that the number of reflections is low and high. The probability distribution function of the received waves is derived in these cases. The bit error rates of the communication are derived by using the proposed method for synchronous and delay detections. The numerical results of the bit error rates indicate that the polarization rotating wave improve communication quality in multipath environment without line-of-sight waves.",

Poor quality of electricity is a major concern for these consumers because of the load shedding problem. This paper focuses on reviewing the current situation of energy demand and the expected load growth in developing countries. Then it will present the main loads contributing to a customer's electricity bill in these countries compared to his monthly income. It will also discuss other factors contributing to the increase in energy demand in developing countries. It will show the effect of increasing energy demand on power supply reflected into power cuts in these countries focusing on introducing the load shedding problem, main power outages, load shedding status in developing countries and the approaches followed in literature to minimize the severity of the problem. Then, the paper will provide the reader with a knowledge based review on distribution generation and renewable energy sources focusing on reviewing the energy demand compared to the available resources and the role of renewable energy sources in facilitating the expansion of electricity supply in developing countries.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents the numerical calculation of iron loss in a novel axial flux machine with segmented armature torus topology is researched. Firstly, the new machine concept and the iron loss model derived from Bertotti's formula are introduced, which subdivides the total iron losses into 3 components: hysteresis losses, eddy current losses and excess losses. The coefficients of the iron loss model are estimated from the measurement data of iron loss at various frequencies and different levels of magnetisation using a curve fitting method. The real waveform of flux density is far from sinusoidal, which is assumed in the Bertotti's formula. Besides, the distribution of flux density in each element is completely different. In order to solve the problems, the Fourier transformation of flux density waveform in each finite element is performed, which requires the complete waveform for a whole electrical period. The total iron loss in the motor is determined as the sum of the iron loss in each element. In order to reduce the computation time, the determination of complete flux density waveform from analysis over one-sixth electrical period is researched. Moreover, for the further reduction of the calculation time the replacing of transient analysis with stationary analysis is also investigated. Finally, the results of iron losses founded on the transient and stationary analysis are compared.",

        "abstract": "Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) converters are often used to continuously track the optimum operating point of a solar panel. Due to their low-cost and ease of implementation, hill climbing (HC) MPPT methods based on the perturbation principles are most commonly used to extract the maximum power (MP). However, the efficiency of these methods are highly influenced by the continued oscillation around the maximum power point. In order to circumvent the problem of continued oscillations and increase efficiency in steady-state and dynamic conditions a modified MPPT algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is simulated in Simulink/Matlab and validated with an experimental. Results from the experiment indicate higher efficiency and better performance in both steady-state and dynamic conditions.",

        "abstract": "The paper deals with the steady-state operation of a radial EHVAC cable transmission system with multiple power injection points, e.g. offshore wind farms, and variable shunt compensation. Generator voltages and variable compensation settings are determined by means of a power flow-based algorithm, aiming at symmetrical current magnitude profiles along individual cable lines (CLs): the proposed operation minimizes Joule losses and maximizes cable line (CL) exploitation. Network code constraints on the reactive power exchanged with the bulk power system are also considered. Successful application to a hypothetical 199 km long, 400 kV-50 Hz cable system collecting up to 2 GW from several OWFs is presented, showing that the proposed operation ensures at least 97% transmission efficiency at full load, with near-unity generator power factor values. Moreover, possible constraints due to sending end voltage rise at full load suggest the implementation of voltage control at the network connection point.",

As such, methods of determining whether a “security chip” contains hardware Trojans are a research concern. This study proposes power relative variation (PRV) parameters to analysis the relation between test vectors and detection sensitivity. Following a brief introduction into Trojans and detection methods, we present the S-box circuit noise model in AES core and simulate the power tracks of various sizes of hardware Trojans using HSPICE. We also apply different sets of test vectors in 40 nm processing. Experimental results show that the power of the entire circuit is reduced by 41% and the PRV value increased 12.71% and 3.34% at most corresponding to combinational and sequential Trojan circuits. The valid test vectors can enhance the activity of hardware Trojans. They can also limit the noise from process, supply voltage, and temperature and extrude the features from the Trojan circuit to increase PRV value. As a result, a sample amount can be compressed at a reduced cost given a similar detection effect. Hence, the investigation into the influence of test vectors on the detection methods of hardware Trojans based on side-channel analysis is extremely important.",

When the PFD-CP includes a reset delay, the noise floor and spurs first increase with the mismatch, reach a maximum value, and then decrease. By considering a simplified piecewise-linear model of the spur production mechanism, we derive an analytical expression for the scaling of the noise and spur as a function of mismatch. We provide estimates for (i) the value of mismatch at which the noise and spur heights are worst and (ii) the value beyond which they disappear. We illustrate our predictions using a simplified Matlab model and confirm them by simulation using the CppSim behavioral simulator.",

        "abstract": "Currently, distributed generation (DG) units usually do not participate in the primary grid voltage control and inject power regardless. Only when the grid voltage level surpasses a certain threshold, these units shut down to avoid any overvoltage problems. In this paper, a method is developed to control the grid voltage by wind turbines. This way, the grid voltage level improves, and the wind turbine can still generate power under suboptimal grid voltage conditions. The effect on the grid voltage depends on the grid impedance ratio R/X. In this paper, the effectiveness of the grid voltage control is improved by estimating the grid impedance ratio in real-time to inject active and reactive power accordingly. The method is applied to wind turbines, but can be used for other DG units as well.",

        "abstract": "Renewable energy and storage technologies had a meaningful growth in the past decades. The use of multilevel topologies within these technologies is being preferable chosen due to better features over the conventional full bridge inverters when the applications involve high power processing. Moreover, digital control algorithms make possible power electronics converters to be operated in different manners without changing their structure. This paper presents a Bidirectional Multilevel Shunt Compensator (BMSC) able to perform different and simultaneous tasks. There are eight possible modes of operation that a decision-taker may demand to the BMSC. The control algorithm is based on the Conservative Power Theory (CPT). Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the BMSC.",

        "abstract": "A system is described where a floating H-bridge converter is located in each phase between the utility grid and an induction machine. These converters are used to adjust the phase and magnitude of the motor voltage relative to the utility grid by injecting a series voltage in each phase. A control strategy is described where: the phase and magnitude of the injected voltage is controlled; the motor phase voltage is estimated without direct measurement. The resulting voltage injection control can achieve a range of objectives: grid VAR control (leading, unity and lagging); control of the floating H bridge dc voltages; motor voltage control. The latter feature can operate the machine under its rated conditions during grid voltage sags and swells. The proposed method is implemented in hardware and experimental results are presented.",

The control strategies analysed are combinations of five types of voltage-current characteristics: DC slack voltage bus, voltage margin, voltage droop, two-stage voltage droop and power-based voltage droop. Transient responses of the DC link voltage and the transmitted power of each grid-side converter are investigated during wind power variations and disconnection of one grid-side converter. Simulation results suggest that the most effective control strategies are voltage droop control and two-stage voltage droop control.",

It is the process of identifying and classifying the proper noun into classes such as person, location, organization and miscellaneous. Substantial work has been done in English and other European languages, achieving greater accuracy compared to the Indian Languages. Although NER in Indian languages is a difficult and challenging task and suffers from scarcity of resources, such work has started to appear recently. This paper discusses work on NER in Assamese using both Conditional Random Fields and a Rule-Based approach which gives an F-measure of 90-95% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Transformerless PV inverters are most preferred for grid connected photovoltaic (PV) generation system due to higher efficiency and lower cost. However, to meet the safety regulations, the leakage current, which deteriorates the power quality and generates EMI of transformerless PV inverter, have to be addressed carefully. In order to eliminate the leakage current, an improved topology based on H5 topology is proposed in this paper. The operation principle, common mode (CM) characteristics, and the impact of junction capacitance of the switches are analyzed in detail. Three-level output voltage has been achieved in the proposed improved inverter by implementing unipolar SPWM with wide input voltage range. Furthermore, the European Union (EU) efficiency is improved by replacing the IGBTs with MOSFETs. The proposed improved inverter topology has been simulated by MATLAB/Simulink software to validate the accuracy of the theoretical explanations. Finally, a 1kw prototype has been built and tested. Experimental results show 98.2% maximum efficiency and 97.76% EU efficiency on the 1kw prototype circuit with 16 kHz switching frequency.",

The simulation model of a synchronous generator is explained, followed by the model of an inverter based distributed generator. With these models hybrid microgrids are formed, and their stability is evaluated by examining three important factors: the black start of the microgrid including the synchronization process of the grid forming inverters, the transient load sharing upon step load changes and its correlation with the rated power of the generators, and the problem of the different time constants of synchronous generators and inverter based-generators.",

Relevant zero-sequence quantities are studied and changes to relay settings are proposed and verified by detailed simulations. The system, developed within the framework of “Piano Operativo Interregionale” (POI) funded by Italian Government, will soon enter service in an Enel Distribuzione (hence:Enel-D) network.",

The effects of machine parameters on the inverter rating are discussed and a method of adjusting the leakage and magnetising parameters by appropriate design of stator slot magnetic wedges is proposed. The analyses have been preformed on a prototype D400 frame 250 kW Brushless DFIG.",

In particular, the response of the LV network will be analyzed over a period of 8 months, with a time rate of 4 snap-shot per hour (i.e. 23,232) and referring to all different possible scenarios (each of which compatible with the pilot plant control system and power management). On the base of simulation results (carried out by power flow, PF, and optimal power flow, OPF), it will be also assessed the effectiveness, in term of cost-benefits analysis, of the installation in the LV network of a suitable sized electrical energy storage system. The main results of simulations, measurements and experimental tests will be proposed and discussed in detail.",

Accurately emulating these new propulsion system designs to assess the dynamic engine-generator-electrical system interactions will be an invaluable design tool. A HIL mechanical emulation system is presented which utilises a novel compensator design to extend the emulation capability of a physical hardware system without the need for any hardware changes. A 30 kW test system is used to emulate variable inertia mechanical systems and drivetrain models to show the capability of a single test system to be used to emulate a wide range of systems. The compensator is not restricted to transport applications and will also improve the emulation of smart grid sources and advanced renewable sources.",

        "abstract": "Many overhead transmission lines in North America have exceeded their expected design life. It is therefore of interest to estimate the conditions and remaining lives of conductors in order to facilitate maintenance and capital replacement planning. Determining condition or health requires considerable investments. This report investigates whether visual inspection and age are sufficient parameters for estimating the remaining life of this asset. The simple visual and age assessment is quantified by means of Health Indexing. The effectiveness of this simple assessment is measured by comparing it to a condition evaluation that is based on detailed, quantitative laboratory testing. The use of life curves for different geographical regions facilitates the process of determining remaining life. Estimated lives based on the simple and more comprehensive assessments, as well as based on chronological age are compared for different geographical regions.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to provide a new robust control system for an induction motor used in electric vehicle (EV). The speed control is based on a polynomial RST controller which can reject disturbance with no steady state errors. High-dynamic performance is obtained using the indirect stator-flux-oriented control (ISFOC) and the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) techniques. For current regulation, we proposed a new fractional order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller based on the multi-objective optimisation evolutionary algorithm (EA). Therefore an excellent start-up response is obtained furthermore the desired dynamic response without unexpected switching behaviour. The proposed control strategies have been simulated on a 3-kW induction-motor drive for an EV. Simulation results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

The interleaved converter is designed with optimization under multi physics constraints to find the optimal architecture with optimal number of cells and looking for the appropriate active and passive components technologies. The results of interleaved converter design are used in simulation to validate the control strategies. An experimental control is carried out to demonstrate the control feasibility.",

Keeping this in mind, the paper investigates the use of hydro pumping as a smart grid player to be used as flexible storage compensator for wind and solar generation in the Sardinian power transmission grid. By considering the current situation, and the energy outlook for 2020, in terms of demand and conventional and renewable generation, the paper investigates on the maximum renewable energy capacity that might be integrated into the Sardinian power system with a different exploitation of hydro pumping storage systems. Hydro pumping storage aims at obtaining the maximum integration of intermittent sources, such as wind and solar, by limiting the amount of renewable energy curtailments.",

The fault current cannot be controlled by the converter switching flows in the anti-parallel diodes. Protection devices are, therefore, required to operate with sufficient speed to avoid device failure. A method is introduced to calculate the critical time for protection to operate. Using this method it is then shown how the critical time may be extended by way of optimization of passive system components. In order to perform this optimization a new post-fault (when the converter gating signals are inhibited) model of the Modular Multi-Level (MMC) converter is introduced which drastically reduces simulation time, allowing high resolution parameter sweeps to be performed. The model is validated and is shown to produce fault characteristics similar to that of a conventional switched model.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the establishing of intelligent system for broken-rotor-bar (BRB) diagnosis based on a novel combination of both, pitch synchronous wavelet transform (PSWT) and multiclass wavelet support vector machines (MWSVM). Most often, broken rotor bar frequency components are hardly detected in the stator current due to its low magnitude and its closeness to the supply frequency component. To overcome this drawback, the PSWT is applied to filter out the fundamental frequency. In order to optimize the cost and the computation time of the diagnosis system, PSWT is implemented under lower sampling rate. MWSVM is developed to perform the faults recognition. Different binary Multiclass SVM strategies are compared with various wavelet kernel functions in terms of classification accuracy, training and testing complexity. The experimental results show that the Directed Acyclic Graph SVM (DAG) gives the best classification accuracy of 99%.",

        "abstract": "Grid connected electrical energy storage could enable large numbers of intermittent renewable generators to be deployed in the UK. Many studies investigate the revenue which could be achieved through arbitrage assuming perfect foresight of electricity prices. In practice, storage operators will not have perfect foresight and will have to devise operational strategies using price forecasts. This paper investigates the impact of forecast accuracy on the optimality of storage revenue. The optimal revenue available is determined using linear programming and historic electricity prices. The results are compared to those found using dynamic programming and electricity price forecasts with increasing percentage error. A small scale lithium ion battery and a large pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) device are compared. The results show that revenue reduces at an increasing rate with increasing forecast error. The PHES device is more sensitive to forecast accuracy than the lithium ion battery. For both technologies, with a maximum error of 30%, 80% of the optimal revenue can be achieved. With increased capacity and significantly increased power rating, the lithium ion battery becomes more sensitive to price forecast accuracy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel distance protection algorithm for long-distance transmission lines is introduced to cater for the problems of the influence caused by distributed capacitance in the long-distance transmission lines and the low fault resistance tolerance by traditional distance relays. To tackle the problem caused by the distributed capacitance in the transmission line, the observing point is moved to the setting point from the relay point by using the Bergeron equations to improve the accuracy of measurement when a fault occurs around the remote terminal. Meanwhile, to tackle the problem of low fault resistance tolerance ability by traditional distance relays especially for phase-ground faults, a new distance protection algorithm concerning the impact of the fault resistance and the opposite system is proposed at the observing point using the information extracted by matrix pencil algorithm. At last, data from PSCAD simulation software demonstrate that the proposed distance protection algorithm can trip the breaker correctly for an internal fault even with high fault resistance and will not overreach for an external fault.",

        "abstract": "“Super-junction” MOSFETs exhibit low on-state resistances and low switching losses. However, the reverse recovery behaviour of their intrinsic diodes and their output capacitance characteristics make their use in voltage-sourced converters challenging. If these difficulties can be addressed, high efficiencies are attainable. Multilevel converters are potentially attractive topologies in electric vehicle charging and energy storage applications. Filter components may be smaller. Also, devices can be combined to give a blocking capability higher than their individual ratings. For example, where a vehicle's battery pack is being charged from or discharged into a 400V three-phase supply, SJ MOSFETs rated at 600V can be deployed in a three-level topology to give a nominal 1200V blocking capability. In this paper, the challenges presented by the super-junction MOSFET are tackled in a demonstration 720V, 3kVA, 20kHz, three-level, three-phase neutral-point-clamped converter.",

The GA is used for tuning the PID parameters with the objective of minimizing the mean absolute error between desired and actual voltage of the DC bus. Simulation results for all the control techniques for the PVHESS with GA-tuned PID controller exhibit superior performance compared to the PID control without GA. Fuzzy control has the best performance in terms of overshoot among the three control methods as compared to other control but it has steady state of 0.2%. In the meantime, PID control shows great improvement with the PID tuning with the GA optimization with a maximum reduction of overshoot by 4.63% and maximum reduction of settling time of 36s. GA optimization is a good alternative solution to find the optimum PID gain for the operating points. The DC bus is well regulated with the maximum overshoot of 2.29% with fuzzy control and 3.79% with PID-GA control at extreme transient occurred.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an autonomous photovoltaic (PV) water pumping system for rural/remote applications. The system has been designed to minimize complexity and cost while guaranteeing fast maximum power point tracking (MPPT). This feature is essential to provide optimum utilization of solar energy, maximizing the amount of extracted water. Low complexity hardware and control ensure higher reliability and ease of installation and servicing. In the proposed scheme, the PV string is directly connected with the DC-link of a three-phase VSI, driving a PMSM pump with a standard Field Oriented Control (FOC). To achieve fast MPPT, the controller integrates a Sliding-Mode Ripple-Correlation (SMRC) MPPT algorithm, acting on the pump speed reference. The system is therefore capable of operating without the need for additional power conversion stages dedicated to MPPT. Matlab simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and control.",

Due to the fact that the farming village is rich with natural resources that can be tapped for captive energy generation, UNMC has developed a central cabin system that can be expanded to control Solar PV system but also other potential renewable energy system such as Mini Hydro, Tidal and even Wind. This paper only focuses on the initial Solar Photovoltaic aspect. . The system was tested with varying loads and results show that the system has the capability to supply sufficient power to rural homes. It is envisaged that this central control unit will be further developed and tested with other renewable energy systems, hence reducing reliance on conventional fossil based generated electricity.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel algorithm for feeder earth-fault protection applicable in compensated and unearthed medium-voltage networks. The suggested algorithm provides good protection sensitivity and very secure discrimination between faulty and healthy feeders even in the most challenging faults with highly distorted signals such as restriking earth faults. The operation of the novel method is based on multifrequency neutral admittance measurement in combination with cumulative phasor summing technique. In the paper, first the theory and operation of the novel algorithm is described. Secondly, the advantages and features brought by the novel method are demonstrated with variety of different fault types. The results show that the novel algorithm provides universal, all-in-one protection function that detects selectively all types of earth faults. Also the overall security and dependability of the existing protection schemes can be improved by the novel method, which can be applied either in tripping or alarming mode depending on the application.",

This paper proposes a grey system theory for predicting the battery capacity and healthy conditions in relation to their discharge cycles. Numerical results via grey system theory-based models are obtained based on the aging data from NASA prognostics data repository. Therefore, the accuracy for the SOC estimation can be examined and improved. In this paper, the accuracy of different grey models including GM (1,1), segmental GM (1,1), Verhulst model, sliding window Verhulst model are investigated and the sliding window Verhulst model is found to be effective for EV batteries.",

        "abstract": "To overcome the limitations of existing gate drive topologies an improved gate drive concept is proposed to provide fast, controlled switching of power MOSFETs. The proposed topology exploits the cascode configuration with the inclusion of an active gate clamp to ensure that the driven MOSFET may be turned off under all load conditions. Key operating principles and advantages of the proposed gate drive topology are discussed. Characteristic waveforms are investigated via simulation and experimentation for the cascode driver in an inductive switching application at 375V and 10A. Experimental waveforms compared well with simulations with long gate charging delays (including the Miller plateau) being eliminated from the gate voltage waveform.",

        "abstract": "The resonant harmonic elimination PWM (RHEPWM) method is brought to mitigate resonant harmonics in the harmonic source of an autotransformer (AT) fed electrified railway in order to suppress high-risk resonances (HRRs). Firstly, the coupling model consisting of a traction power supply network (TPSN) and a traction drive unit (TDU) of a high-speed train is established, and the HRR mechanism which indicates that the composite pulse voltage of the multiple four-quadrant converters in the TDU is the harmonic source is analysed based on it. Then the RHEPWM technology applied into the multiple converters is described thoroughly, and the target functions and initial commutating angles are decided based on the conventional carrier-shifting based sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (CSBSPWM). Subsequently, the optimal commutating angles are obtained by the rolling Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method. Finally, the combined simulation model consisting of an AT fed TPSN and a TDU is implemented in a RT-Lab simulator, and the performance comparison between CSBSPWM and RHEPWM is carried out through the time-domain simulation. The results verify that RHEPWM not only has the capacity to suppress HRR, but also improves the total power factor and mitigates the distortion in the load current.",

PV MPPT can be considered as event driven problem. In addition to that, State-Flow is commonly used as a graphical design and development tool which can be utilized in logic problems' solving and complex control systems. This paper presents an enhanced performance PV MPPT technique based on State-Flow design. A detailed analysis along with simulation and experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed technique in comparison with conventional Perturb and Observe (P&O) MPPT technique.",

The new design includes the metal-ceramic housing ensuring proper heat transfer, the magnetic circuit containing set of permanent magnets with various magnetic field values and Curie temperatures, the completely redesigned windings and current/voltage converter used instead of the electromotive force amplifier. Its principle of operation is based on electrodynamical interaction and therefore it may be referred as a passive eddy-current sensor. Two applications of the technique are presented such as blade vibration measurement in High Pressure Turbine of military turbofan (tip-timing) and speed monitoring of roller-element bearing supporting the shaft in a turbojet engine.",

It is worth noticing that only the stator currents and voltages sensors are required. So, the rotor currents are reconstituted via the identified DFIG inductances. As, the identification procedure depends on the stator and rotor flux so, this latter is derived through a proposed sliding mode observer related to stator currents. The feasibility of our method is evaluated by simulation, in the case of stator power control involved with a DFIG rating at 1.5 MW.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a system identification approach for power electronic systems, based upon a Kalman Filter (KF) approach. The proposed technique offers good parameter estimation accuracy, but with reduced mathematical complexity compared to other schemes, such as recursive least squares (RLS) based techniques. In this paper, the transfer function parameters of a dc-dc converter are estimated using both KF and RLS approaches. A brief assessment of both algorithms is presented, followed by a detailed simulation. Results demonstrate that the KF algorithm performs better than the RLS when an abrupt load change is applied to the buck converter; both in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and algorithm convergence time.",

Therefore obtaining information of the temperature development in a module is of highest priority for reliability. As part of the condition monitoring for power electronic devices, the temperature needs to be measured in order to predict the remaining lifetime. Since temperature cannot be measured directly, temperature sensitive parameters are extracted from characteristic electrical values. In this paper possible measurement methods for the indirect determination of the chip temperature in power semiconductors are presented, analyzed and compared.",

We have inverstgated different approaches at our faculty in the last years, how to enhance the students' capabilities in C programming and how to lower the failure rate of the C-programming course. Several concepts involved are: visualization of control and data flow, game programming and automated assessment tools with plagiarism detection. we have integrated some of these concepts into the programming environment Virtual-C IDE. This paper discusses the educational benefits of using the Virtual-C IDE for lectures, self-learning and as a platform for programming assignments and reports our first practical experiences.",

However, the technologies which would facilitate users to find and use such data do not follow such rapid development. For this reason, European regulations and guidelines for the development of sustainable mobility in cities are increasingly emphasizing the importance of the use of multimodal travel guides. The aim of this paper is to describe the concept of cooperative development of multimodal guide based on the optimal use of travel and traffic information. Such systems should provide information about optimal route taking into consideration optimal spatial, cost and time variables.

Such an inverter finds widespread use in applications like interfacing alternate energy sources to the grid, UPS systems. A resonant LC circuit is used to achieve natural commutation of leakage energy in the leakage inductance of the transformer. This natural commutation of leakage energy eliminates the need for additional circuitry otherwise needed to commutate the trapped energy. Additionally, the high frequency ac link makes it possible to reduce the size of the transformer resulting in a lower cost and a compact design. The ac link is utilized to achieve zero voltage switching in the output cycloconverter. A 3 phase, 5 kW inverter is simulated in the SIMULINK environment and the results are discussed.",

A key requirement for the in-wheel motor is high torque density with minimum torque ripple. The outer-rotor surface permanent magnet synchronous machine with the fractional-slot concentrated-winding configuration lends itself for the application. In this paper, the electromagnetic performance of the machine with various stator slot and rotor pole combinations is optimized by particle swarm algorithm based on finite element analysis (FEA). The optimised designs are comprehensively appraised by key performance metrics. The study shows that the particle swarm optimisation is superior to other tools in terms of simplicity and effectiveness in multi-objective parametric machine design.",

        "abstract": "With the increase penetration of renewable energy sources such as solar being connected to the utility grid, the use of power converters plays a major role in ensuring maximum power delivered with high efficiency. Though, the usage of power converters indirectly leads to the rise of harmonic content in the distributed system with its switching mechanism for power conversion. Filters are widely used in such situation to maintain a good state of power quality. Lots of research has been carried out to propose filter design methodology. This paper presents the implementation of LCL filter in a grid model with further harmonic attenuation through resonance mitigation. The design of the proposed filters is validated by simulation results in PSCAD software. The results show that the improved design meets the standards parallel to the THD and individual harmonic limits.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, different methods to limit short circuit currents in DC traction networks are compared. Typically, DC traction networks are supplied by the AC grid by means of an uncontrolled diode bridge rectifier. In case of a low-impedance short circuit fault between catenary and rail, the fault current reaches a large value. For densely meshed networks the mechanical circuit breakers can become too slow. The methods studied are applying fault current limiters, faster interruption of fault currents and adding controlled rectifiers. The fault current limiters considered are a reactor and a superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). For faster interruption of fault currents, a hybrid circuit breaker is investigated. Simulations show that the short circuit current can be limited considerably by installing limitation devices after the rectifiers, when the short circuit occurs close to a substation. Fast interruption of the fault or application of the SFCL results in the strongest reduction of the short circuit current.",

        "abstract": "Computer simulation tools can give early indicators of key vehicle characteristics. In traditional hybrid vehicles, this is important in designing for optimal fuel consumption; in plug-in hybrids and pure electric vehicles, it is critical for accurate prediction of range, a key market qualifier. There are a variety of techniques, typically operating at different levels of fidelity and employing different modelling philosophies. This paper develops on earlier work, exploring conventional and `backward' techniques in the context of current NEDC-based UNECE vehicle testing standards and the proposed replacements based on the World Light Test Procedure. Model sensitivities for A, C and D-segment vehicles are quantified and this is used to explore aspects where accurate models are key and where lower-fidelity representative models are appropriate. The paper also explores the sensitivity of predictions to `PID control' driver models, and discusses the effect of cycle-following tolerance on predictions. Finally, the paper proposes new standards - suitable for simulation or real-world testing - for a common quantification of in-use battery lifetime. The use of these techniques and the sensitivity analysis methods on a representative simulation model is demonstrated as a case study, and the impacts on battery management strategy design are explored.",

IEEE Standard C37.118-2005 introduced measurement accuracy under steady state conditions as well as interference rejection. In 2009, the IEEE started a joint project with IEC to harmonize real time communications in IEEE Standard C37.118-2005 with the IEC 61850 communication standard. These efforts led to the need to split the C37.118 into 2 different standards: IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 that now includes performance of synchrophasors under dynamic systems conditions; and IEEE Standard C37.118.2-2011 Synchrophasor Data Transfer for Power Systems, the object of this paper.",

        "abstract": "Battery Life Cycle modelling and estimation are key challenges in the modern electric systems, also due to the development of renewable energy and electrified transportation systems exploitation: in such fields indeed the battery has emerged as the most prominent energy storage device, attracting a significant amount of studies. It is however well known that battery lifetime depends on many parameters, such as power density, specific power, energy density, operating environment, etc., so that an accurate methods to analyze this dependence, also taking into account the randomness of the above parameters in real operating conditions, is a necessary even if difficult task. In this framework, in the paper, after a thorough statistical data analysis, a probabilistic method for battery design is proposed which ensures the optimization of a suitable cost function which has the expected lifetime as a basic input. The method takes properly into account, in particular, the random variations in specific power experienced by a lead-acid battery. The statistical features of lifetime are also explored by means of a large series of numerical simulations based upon suitable probability distributions which may characterize the above operating conditions, in order to obtain an efficient estimation of the above lifetime distribution.",

To assure and provide a flexible and a system compatible integration of those decentralized energy resources, power electronic inverters as grid interfaces between energy conversion systems (ECS) and the main grid getting more important. Hence, the inverter has to join the grid operation functions, e.g. frequency and voltage stabilization, similar to the conventional power plants. By implementation of a new control approach based on symmetrical components, the control speed at asymmetrical load and grid conditions is improved. The control approach is verified in a FPGA based smart grid inverter platform, confirming the potential at a hardware system. When using fast control functions for asymmetrical grid conditions it is possible to guarantee stability of future smart grids at rising penetration of distributed energy resources to the main grid.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a novel method of inter-turn fault detection based on measurement of high frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) ripple current is proposed. The method uses the ripple current generated by the inverter itself as a means to detect inter-turn fault. High frequency impedance behaviours of healthy and faulted windings are analysed and modelled, and ripple current signature due to inter-turn faults is quantified. A simple analogue circuit is designed to extract the PWM ripple current via an RMS band-pass filter and the filtered RMS current is used for fault detection. In addition, the method also identifies the faulted phase. The method is tested in simulation on a five phase alternate slot wound SPM machine.",

        "abstract": "The majority of Blade Tip Timing (BTT) acquisition and analysis systems require a once per revolution (OPR) timing reference that is vibration free and reliable throughout the whole speed range of the rotor under investigation. Typically this consists of a probe and a target mounted somewhere close to the rotor centre line. In many applications the installation of the OPR sensor is expensive, and in the case of turbines, in a non-optimal position due to access and environmental constraints. OPR systems are usually duplicated for redundancy and failure rates are high. The loss of the OPR signal usually results in the loss of all analysis capability for a BTT application. Numerous attempts have been made to derive the OPR signal from the blade arrival time, however, the blades themselves undergo vibration (the exact same phenomena that we are trying to identify and quantify) leading to significant uncertainties in the resulting analysis. This presentation details an analytical method for reproducing the reference time for each revolution from one or many blade arrival time sensors without the need for a separate measurement channel. Validation will be presented for a number of real engine data sets covering a range of blade sizes and engine speeds. Utilising this method allows the elimination of the OPR measurement system and opens up the opportunity to reanalyse previously obtained data where the OPR system may have been compromised during the test. In a flight EHM system where weight and performance are critical the elimination of the OPR system is highly desirable.",

Because of the regulated environment that utilities must operate in it is not feasible for utilities to build adequate traditional infrastructure to address these events; i.e. more transmission lines and more large central generators. Microgrid technologies have the potential to address some of the challenges associated with improving the resiliency of the nations electrical infrastructure. Microgrids are not a new concept but advances in device capabilities, computing capabilities, and communications are making them a more attractive option.

The Adaptive Notch Filter (ANF) is proposed to deal with those unbalanced and distorted PCC voltage. The Matlab/SimpowerSystems tool has proved that the ANF successful facilitates the ShAPF in terms of compensating harmonics current of nonlinear loads even without balance voltage circumstance.",

A study of an effective low voltage DC-AC converter is therefore presented. Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) performance (in particular power loss) is compared with a conventional IGBT-based 2-level converter and its advantages highlighted. A phase-shifted sinusoidal PWM based individual voltage balancing strategy for the MMC is presented. A proportional-resonant controller is introduced to eliminate the 2nd harmonic circulating current in the H-bridge MMC converter.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to briefly describe a mathematical approach for the direct coupling between analytical formal solution of magnetic scalar potential and reluctance network method for the magnetic modelling of electrical machines. This coupling can help solve the problem of air-gap modelling in magnetic equivalent circuit method, and the consideration of the local magnetic saturation in modelling approaches involving analytical formal solution of Maxwell's equations. The analytical formal solution of magnetic scalar potential is developed in low permeability regions of the machine while the reluctance network method is used to model the ferromagnetic regions. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model is demonstrated by comparing obtained results with finite elements simulation for an illustrative case study.",

        "abstract": "Without utilizing zero vectors, reduced common-mode voltage pulsewidth modulation (RCMV-PWM) have been proposed to reduce the common-mode voltage (CMV) and the leakage current in three-phase transformerless photovoltaic (PV) inverter. Nevertheless, the elimination of the zero vectors from RCMV-PWM methods have degraded the overall performance of the PV inverters such as cost, voltage linearity, dc-link current ripples and harmonic distortion. In order to solve these issues, H7 inverter with modified discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (MDPWM) is proposed recently. The leakage current is reduced without sacrificing the performance of the PV inverter. In this paper, a simple three-phase inverter topology with corresponding modulation technique is proposed. It is proven that the leakage current is reduced to comply with the standard requirement without sacrificing the performance of the PV inverter. The analysis and the performance are verified via simulation results.",

These approaches are based on combining the well-known Bag-of-Words (BOW) and the Bag-of-Concepts (BOC) text representation schemes and utilizing Wikipedia as a knowledge base. The proposed representations are used to generate a vector space model, which in turn is fed into a classifier to categorize a collection of Arabic textual documents. Three different machine learning based classifiers have been utilized in this work. Performance of proposed text representation models is evaluated in comparison to using a standard BOW scheme and a concept-based scheme, as well as recently reported similar text representation schemes that are based on augmenting the standard BOW with the BOC.",

Apart from reduced output harmonics due to three-level operation, the T-type converter benefits from lower switching loss as a result of using of devices with lower voltage ratings and switching only half of the dc-link voltage. The loss distribution among the devices has been investigated with various modulation index and power factor. The T-type converter efficiency has also been evaluated against a two-level converter and a three-level neutral-point-clamped converter, where the T-type converter shows higher efficiency up to 30kHz switching frequency and can achieve 97% efficiency at 50kHz.",

During the commutation time in matrix converter, unwanted voltage error occurs which destroys output waveform quality. Influence of commutation delay is more distinct in high switching frequency matrix converter. After presenting the relationship between the output voltage error with commutation delay and switching frequency theoretically, effect of commutation delay on output waveform distortion in low and high switching frequency is investigated experimentally. It has been relieved commutation delay value has to be minimizing as is possible to decrease distortion in output waveforms for high switching frequency matrix converter.",

        "abstract": "The broad diffusion of renewable energy-based technologies has introduced several open issues in the design and operation of Smart Grids (SGs). Recently, several studies have focused attention on the Power Quality (PQ) when Distributed Generators (DGs) connected to SGs inject a large amount of power. This paper discusses the influence of PhotoVoltaic (PV) plants in real distribution lines. In particular, a numerical tool has been developed in order to study the active power of distribution lines. The dataset derives from real measured acquisitions of distribution lines feeding residential and commercial users. The mathematical approach is based on both the Wavelet Analysis (WA) and the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) in order to select and isolate the different operation modes of the distribution line. Numerical results highlight that PV plants strongly affect the time-domain power signal. As this signal is typically non stationary and nonlinear, the HHT-based approach allows to fix power disturbances and anomalies.",

So, researching topological structures of complex networks is important and catches many researchers' attention. A class of bound growing network models (BGN-models) has been defined in this article. We determine some properties of the bound growing network models, such as scale-free, power law distribution, degree cumulative distribution. Since thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes) and networks have more leaves, we provide an algorithm for finding spanning trees having maximum leaves (ML-spanning trees) in the BGN-models, and determine some important properties of ML-spanning trees as well as apply ML-spanning trees to determine balanced and dominating sets in BGN-models.",

This is due the decreasing system inertia and increasing maximum generation loss in the system. Therefore, ROCOF protection will require higher setting to prevent unwanted operation while still ensuring correct detection of LOM condition. This paper proposes risk assessment analysis as a technique to find optimum setting which aims to minimise the risk of protection malfunction. The analysis use predicted Great Britain power system generation mix for year 2020 with gone green scenario. The study has successfully found the optimum setting of the ROCOF protection which provides minimum overall risk under specific assumptions. The recommended setting is 0.5 Hz/s with operating time-delay 500ms.",

This method needs to measure the terminal voltage of power devices by a low voltage detector circuit connected in parallel to each device. The proposed technique enables us to decrease the current total harmonic distortion and improve the current profile during zero crossing. This method is simple and it can be easily extensible for multilevel inverter models. Theoretical and simulation results are presented in this article.",

However, due to the number of machine parameters, with some tightly `coupled' with each other, optimisation of the design could become extremely challenging by conventional analytical means. Here, the particle swarm optimization method is used in the design of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for small-scale wind power system. Five inter-dependent design parameters are adjusted simultaneously to achieve an optimal solution for the application. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is employed to evaluate the electromagnetic performance for the optimization. The results show the proposed optimization method is efficient and with fast convergence.",

        "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes are densely deployed in sensing area, which increases redundant data packet transmission and results to lots of energy consumption. To save network energy, nodes schedule is applied to set the redundant nodes to sleep state while the non-redundant nodes remain active state. This paper proposes an Energy Saving Sleep Scheduling algorithm (EPSS). First, unequal clustering is executed for the entire wireless sensor networks, and Cluster Head(CH) are selected by considering node residual energy and the distance between nodes. Then, cluster head implenments sleeping schedule in cluster. The sleeping probability of each node is decided by the node density in its own cluster and the distance between node and CH. The simulation results shows that the proposed algorithm can reduce energy consumption and prolong the lifecycle of network.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a hardware in the loop (HIL) system including the implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based estimator on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for speed-sensorless control of IM. The implemented EKF algorithm simultaneously estimates stator currents (1sα and 1sβ), stator fluxes (Ψsα and Ψsβ), rotor angular velocity (wm), and load torque (tL) by assuming that stator voltages and currents are available. The HIL system also includes stator currents and fluxes based IM model which provides actual stator currents to the EKF algorithm and is also utilized to validate the flux, speed and load torque estimations of the implemented EKF algorithm. Virtex-5 VSX110T FPGA evolution board is used for this real-time application. The FPGA board is programmed via Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) in order to develop both IM model and the EKF algorithm. ISE Design Suit Interface is used as debugger and compiler. The results obtained from the EKF and IM model developed on FPGA are graphically compared to verify the sufficiency of estimation performance of the EKF algorithm and demonstrate that EKF algorithm is implemented successfully with less computational time (less sampling time for each recursive operation) due to the inherent parallel signal processing ability of FPGA.",

        "abstract": "Flywheels as energy storage systems are good candidates for numerous power system applications such as voltage support, serving fluctuating loads, frequency regulation and renewable energy utilization. Most of these applications utilize flywheel energy storage systems (FESSs) at medium voltage ranges. This paper discusses the optimization of the medium voltage high power converters interfacing the FESS with the grid. A dual three phase induction machine (IM) is proposed to drive the flywheel and is controlled via two series-connected three phase voltage source front end converters (VSCs). The proposed configuration is believed to reduce the converters ratings by a half compared to the conventional configuration where three-phase IM with single three-phase VSC is employed. The machine modelling and control are presented, in addition to converters DC links balancing technique. The performance of the proposed system is verified via simulation using MATLAB/Simulink.",

        "abstract": "The integration of distributed generation in conventional radial distribution system provides improvement in power quality and enhancement in the power supply capacity. However, this integration changes the nature of distribution system from passive to active and has given rise to certain technical issues. The occurrence of islanding is one of the important issues in this context. This paper presents a new islanding detection technique based on artificial neural network. The proposed technique uses rate of change of frequency, rate of change of voltage, rate of change of active power, and rate of change of reactive power as the ANN inputs. The appropriate data base of various islanding and non islanding cases is created for training the ANN. The ANN test results ensure that proposed method is able to classify accurately islanding and non islanding events and has zero non detection zone.",

        "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) energy is one of the fastest growing renewable energy resources. Most PV units are connected to the distribution or transmission grid by voltage source converters (VSC). As the number and size of grid-connected PV units increase, the requirements placed on them by grid operators are changing. Among the new requirements by some grid codes is that PV units should help with voltage support by reactive power compensation. One significant advantage of a grid connected PV system capable of reactive power compensation is that it can operate during the night as a reactive power compensator. This paper presents the control of a grid-connected PV system with reactive power compensation using Direct Power Control with Space Vector Modulation (DPC-SVM). Simulation results for both daytime and night-time operation are presented. The results show good dynamic and steady-state performance, decoupled control of active and reactive power, low distortion in the output voltage and current, and constant switching frequency over a wide range of conditions.",

The lifetime analyses which base on the Coffin-Manson model never consider the modulus saltation of silicone enclosure with the temperature changing. With an extensive DOE, an improved Coffin-Manson model is proposed, which also copes with the glass transition of silicone encapsolent. With this improved model, a more accurate prediction of wire-bonding reliability can be made.",

Within the framework of ac fault studies, transient performance issues associated with dc voltage control, the phase locked loop, and reactive power control are addressed. Fundamental limitations imposed on the behaviours of converter power and current control by inverter operations are identified. An adaptive current limit is introduced to maintain the dc grid voltage and converter currents within acceptable levels, and to improve the quality of the system responses to ac system faults. Simulations are performed employing a four-terminal HVDC test system.",

        "abstract": "Induction heating is a well-known technique to produce very high temperature at reduced time for well specific applications such as in melting steel, brazing, and hardening. Series resonant converter proves to suit better to surface metals treatment and hardening. Efficiency reaches its highest level in the resonant mode, where switching losses are minimized by operating the IGBT at a resonant frequency for switching at the zero crossing point of current or voltage. However, as heat rises during hardening metal process, the metal exhibits parameter variations, which ultimately affects the overall system performances. Therefore, the inverter system with an effective load-adaptive control circuit with short response time is highly sought to let the system operate efficiently regardless of any variation of the load parameters. This will bring back the system under resonant mode to allow the system to operate at its optimal performances. In this paper, an analysis of a series resonant inverter performance is conducted, in which the control frequency is monitored and continuously adapted using phase-locked loop aimed to metal hardening. The control technique is characterized by its flexibility, low cost hardware, and short response time. The system comprises analogue and digital circuits, microcontroller based. The experimental bench is built for the purpose in the range of 1 to 5 kW power, with 01 to 50 kHz operating frequency. First, the process principle and the design procedure of the inverter system with the proposed control scheme are described through modelling and simulation. Then, experimental results are presented to show the validity of this technique, and to evaluate the system performances.",

The paper presents the theory necessary to understand how three floating capacitor H-bridge converters can be used to control the motor voltage during starting and hence limit the motor starting current to the desired level. The proposed soft-start system can also be used during steady state operation for other purposes such as making the utility power factor to be less lagging, unity or leading, hence enabling VAR control and grid voltage support in large motor applications. Hardware implementation is presented together with experimental results that show that the proposed control strategy can successfully soft start a standard squirrel cage induction machine under a range of load conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the ability to implement current limit control during starting.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an online feedback-based (FB) field weakening (FW) control technique for interior permanent magnet (IPM) brushless AC (BLAC) machines with due accounting for nonlinear machine parameters and inverter characteristics in traction applications. The proposed method computes the dq-axis current references online instead of employing predefined look-up tables (LUT) as in the conventional schemes. Thus, it provides the flexibility for online parameter update or estimation to enhance the drive system efficiency. It is shown that in the FB-based FW operation where the machine voltage magnitude is maintained at the voltage hexagon boundary via the voltage FB loop using the ideal FB voltage references which the nonlinear inverter characteristics are neglected, the stator flux reference regulated via the voltage FB loop may not be optimally controlled due to the mismatch between the ideal demand and actual voltages applied to the IPM BLAC machine. For a given torque, it results in a higher current magnitude than the ideal demand, and therefore leads to extra copper losses. To solve this problem, a nonlinear inverter compensation (NIC) method is proposed and experimentally validated by measurements on a 10kW IPM BLAC drive. It is shown that by incorporating the proposed NIC technique, the achievable torque under a given speed can be increased up to 4% and the copper losses under a torque demand and given speed can be reduced up to 4% in the FW operation region.",

        "abstract": "Reasonable protection measures can improve the lightning performance of 500-kV transmission lines and reduce trip-out rates. An assessment method based on IAHP is proposed to formulate lightning protection measures in accordance with the evaluation process of screen-selection-optimization. Based on several commonly existed lightning transformations, perform technical and economic analysis first to obtain the primary choice. Then, theoretical lightning protection measure is selected by comprehensively considering constrained factors according to the IAHP weights. Thereby, examine whether the transformation works by calculating the shielding failure rate through the establishment of EGM model, thus the optimal method is confirmed finally. The application of the method is illustrated by using a typical 500 kV transmission line under complex terrain, and the expected evaluation results have shown that the proposed protection performance can meet the transformation requirements well and guide engineering practice effectively.",

This paper studies this phenomenon using root locus analysis. A controller based on the second derivative of the output capacitor voltage is proposed to enhance the stability of the system.

A simple model of a mono-pole, ground return, MTDC system is built in ATP draw using a distributed parameter, frequency dependent overhead line model. For this system, the high frequency content in the current signal directly following a fault (at approximately 0.2 kHz) is shown to vary significantly with fault location but not fault resistance. The protection algorithm is then validated in real time using an RTDS system, where both the ATP primary system model and the MATLAB developed algorithm are demonstrated in a real time context.",

Previous development of its controller was by using modified ADALINE algorithm for harmonics extraction, which somehow still having complex features. Therefore, this paper presents three major improvements to the algorithm in related to sine and cosine vectors, weight updating algorithm, and average square error. The proposed algorithm is designed and developed in shunt APF's controller, and the shunt APF is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show significant improvement as compared to the previous algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the dynamic performance of an active rectifier integrated into a wind park. The small changes in the DC current and the DC voltage are examined. The small variations are caused by the miniature power flow unbalance between the offshore wind park and the grid land. Internal DC collector is considered into the wind park, which provides an internal DC medium voltage bus. The AC output signal from the wind generator to the internal DC collector or DC bus is regulated through active rectifier. An active rectifier is a cascade connection of an uncontrolled full bridge diode rectifier and a controlled DC-DC boost converter. The small changes in the DC current and DC voltage due to power flow unbalance are analysed across the boost converter. The way in which these small variations affect the internal medium DC voltage is determined. The results are presented in the form of small signal transfer functions and are evaluated with MATLAB software.",

The scheme utilizes on-line measurements of voltages and currents, as well as line material parameters and weather data to apply a thermal on-line forecast. Thus, it is possible to estimate the remaining withstand time of all concerned overloaded lines. Therewith, suitable countermeasures and the optimal time for their execution can be determined. For the proof of concept, a detailed modeling concept of the thermal behavior of overhead lines in grid operation is performed in dynamic power system simulations.",

From the initial model with 6-pole, 9-slot, and concentrated winding, numerical design characteristics on torque ripple reduction in accordance with various structural configurations of stator tooth, rotor notch shape, and PM barrier are investigated. Moreover, the designed model which minimizes torque ripple is proposed and its characteristics are validated with comparison of the initial model with respect to Back-EMF Total Harmonics Distortion (THD), radial force density, cogging torque, spatial and time harmonics of torque ripple computed via numerical co-simulation with inverter.",

The data redundancy caused by the overmuch attributes in defects data set will make the prediction accuracy decrease. A model based on locally linear embedding and support vector machine (LLE-SVM) is proposed to solve this problem in this paper. The SVM is used as the basic classifier in the model. And the LLE algorithm is used to solve data redundancy due to its ability of maintaining local geometry. The parameters in SVM are optimized by the method of ten-fold cross validation and grid search. The comparison between LLE-SVM model and SVM model was experimentally verified on the same NASA defect data set. The results indicate that the proposal LLE-SVM model performs better than SVM model, and it is available to avoid the accuracy decrease caused by the data redundancy.",

Firstly, the torque and flux weakening control performances of C-core SFPM machine with/without voltage error regulation are compared. It is shown that the flux weakening performance can be improved when the voltage error regulation method is utilised. Moreover, the performances of four different SFPM machine topologies, i.e. conventional, multi-tooth, C-core and E-core SFPM machines are measured and compared using the voltage error regulation method. Overall, it has been concluded that the performances of C-core and E-core machines have better performance in terms of torque and power than that for the multi-tooth and conventional SFPM machines.",

The strength and consistency of harmonic signatures between three industrial WRIMs with different design parameters is examined. A numerical harmonic model is used to predict and investigate WRIMs' stator and rotor currents and electromagnetic torque signals spectra. The model results are verified by comparison with experimental measurements made on two laboratory test rigs. The presented model and experimental results demonstrate significant and highly consistent current and vibration signals spectral contents patterns between the considered industrial WRIM designs.",

For that reason, in cases where the power transfer contains a high degree of fluctuation such produced by a wind farm, power losses will be much higher than with same average power transferred smoothly. For this reason, the use of energy storage in power systems reduces transmission line losses and hence can improve the overall efficiency of the system if the energy storage losses are smaller. This paper investigates the potential to improve the overall efficiency by developing an analytical model for the energy storage and the transmission line losses depending on disturbance and confirms it via PSCAD/EMTDC simulation for idealised and real wind profile data.",

An application of primal-dual interior point method and simplified branch-bound method in reactive power optimization is proposed in this paper. Primal-dual interior point method is applied for the solution of the relaxed nonlinear programming problems and branch-bound method is applied to deal with the discrete variations. Further, a simplified branch-bound method is proposed to reduce the computational time while still getting relative optimal solution. Two test studies show that the proposed algorithm is effective to solve reactive power optimization problems.",

        "abstract": "With the growing scale of wind power penetrated into grid, protective relays of transmission line face the challenges of adaptability. The relays based on fault component are widely used in transmission line protection, which makes it essentially important to study the adaptability of fault component protection. The adaptability of fault component protection to wind farm integration system is studied in this paper. Fault component protection works well only when the system impedance is stable or the positive and negative sequence system impedances are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis, PSCAD simulation and fault record data show that the positive sequence impedance at wind farm side has large fluctuations and obvious difference from the negative sequence impedance. This significantly reduces the reliability of the relays based on fault component in wind farm integration system.",

The identification principle is based on the different variation trends of voltage in the cases of disturbance and fault, and this characteristic difference of voltage will be amplified in the IMF with the lowest frequency band by decomposing the voltage fault component using EMD. Thus, integration value of the selected IMF is employed as the criterion for distinguishing disturbance from fault. A ±500kV HVDC system simulation model, including detailed lightning stroke simulation model, is built in PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results show that the proposed disturbance identification method can distinguish disturbances from faults correctly with ultra-high-speed, providing a strong guarantee for main protection to prevent the mal-operation in the case of disturbance.",

Using this data, the condition of the track geometry can be assessed. By monitoring this data as the vehicle moves around its normal operating route(s), changes in track geometry can be tracked with a relatively fine granularity in time. The research described here details the uses to which such fine granularity track geometry data could be put, and the development of automated processing to extract the desired information. The aim is to observe track geometry through renewals, degradation and maintenance to understand how faults develop and how effective maintenance has been.",

However, the big data era makes even higher demands from the data mmmg technologies in terms of both processing speed and data amounts. Any data mmmg algorithm itself can hardly meet these requirements towards effective processing of big data, so distributed systems are proposed to be used. In this paper, a novel method of integrating a sequential pattern mmmg algorithm with a fast large-scale data processing engine Spark is proposed to mine patterns in big data. We use the well-known algorithm PrefixSpan as an example to demonstrate how this method helps handle massive data rapidly and conveniently. The experiments show that this method can make full use of cluster computing resources to accelerate the mmmg process, with a better performance than",

In power system, more especially in distribution networks, DGs can able to mitigate the total losses of the network which effectively has significant effects on environmental pollution. Optimal location and size of DG in distribution networks is one of the important issues of the power system. This paper aims to investigate the best solution for optimal operation of distribution networks by taking into consideration of DG. The optimal allocation of DG can be considered as an integer problem that can be formulated by metaheuristic methods. In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used to solve the DG placement and sizing. The IEEE 34 bus test system has been utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSO algorithm on herein mentioned problem. The result illustrates the losses minimization and voltage profile improvement.",

The calculation takes into account the bus bar connector's contact resistance and physical properties of the materials involved. Using the field distributions, the eddy power losses and the electromagnetic forces have been calculated. The influence of the operation current and short current on these quantities is also examined. The distributions of current density and electromagnetic force in the conductors and tank are not uniform. The electromagnetic forces of bus conductors are large enough to overcome hold forces exerted by the contact springs under short circuit conditions.",

The primary goal is to use the subthreshold characteristics of long-channel devices to characterize the interface of etched InGaAs fin sidewalls. We have investigated the impact of forming gas anneal, high-K oxide and number of digital etch cycles following RIE. Our results indicate a minimum interface state density (Dit) of ∼ 3×1012 cm−2eV−1 obtained in fin sidewalls with Al2O3 and HfO2 oxides after 4 cycles of dig ital etch. This is equivalent to results reported on planar devices and bodes well for future Trigate MOSFETs that will not require a barrier semiconductor covering the sidewalls.",

        "abstract": "The production cost of electrical energy has created a need to find reliable, cheap and accessible sources for energy generation. As a result, the use of alternative sources such as wind and solar energy is in rapid growth world-wide. Nowadays these renewable energies are always combined with energy storage systems (ESSs) to save extra energy production and keep the production level below a specific limit. An ESS could also be combined with a STATCOM in a power system. This combination could add the benefits of an ESS to the advantages of a FACTS device such as reduced power flows on overloaded lines, resulting in increased system loadability, lower transmission line losses, improved power system stability and security, lower power production costs, and more secure bus voltage levels. This paper presents a genetic algorithm-based optimization process, for seeking optimal locations and parameters for a STATCOM combined with an ESS in power systems. The optimization process is designed to minimize transmission line losses and maximize the power transmitted by the network. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed optimization process in determining optimal locations for the device in several test networks.",

Each of these loads are generally accompanied by load transformers. As these auxiliary loads are switched-in, their transformers also become energized. An inrush current often develops when the transformer is switched-in. This paper proposes an inrush current elimination technique for line-interactive UPS systems during the switching-in of auxiliary load transformers by utilizing a fast acting current regulated voltage source inverter. The proposed inrush current elimination technique is validated by simulation results.",
