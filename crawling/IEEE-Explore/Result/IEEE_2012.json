In the design of these systems it is important to appraise the motor performance across the entire torque-speed envelope. This paper presents computationally efficient techniques that allow rapid and accurate modelling of the entire operational envelope of any BLAC PM motor, enabling the generation of torque/speed characteristics and loss maps that can be used in an iterative design process. The proposed techniques are validated against test data from an in-house 35kW interior PM motor design and a comparison between a measured and computed efficiency map for the 2004 Toyota Prius motor is undertaken.",

The macroscopic parameters d- and q-axis insulation ratios, kwq and kwd, respectively, are introduced. They describe fully the geometry characteristic of the p-pole pair, two barrier rotor. The presented combined analytical-FEM approach gives the optimal distribution of air and iron for the maximum torque. Saturation effects and other two dimensional nonlinearities are included by a limited number of FEM simulations to determine the best kwq and kwd. The method is shown to obtain the maximum torque accurately and fast for a specific stator without directly dealing with the rotor geometry dimensions.",

        "abstract": "The paper investigates power transmission limitations in a VSC-HVDC system imposed by the ac system's impedance characteristics. An important observation from the study is that the operation of the converter is affected, not only by the magnitude of this impedance (quantified by the Short Circuit Ratio or SCR), but also significantly by its angle. An interesting result is that the larger the resistive component (i.e. impedance angle less than 90°), the larger is the minimum SCR required at the rectifier. The trend at the inverter end is the opposite, and the inverter is able to operate into systems with smaller SCR. Although operation is theoretically possible at the analytically calculated minimum SCRs, the paper shows that as the ac system approaches this value, the gains of the phase locked loop (PLL) used for angle reference generation must be reduced.",

        "abstract": "Because of its simplicity and ease of implementation, the perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm is the most commonly applied maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control scheme in photovoltaic (PV) applications. Two techniques are usually used for implementing the P&O algorithm: reference voltage perturbation where a reference value for the PV generator output voltage is used as the control parameter and direct duty ratio perturbation where the duty ratio of the MPPT converter is used directly as the control parameter. This paper presents an experimental comparison between these two techniques when used in a photovoltaic system feeding a resistive load. The influence of the step size and the speed at which the control parameter is perturbed is investigated. The various advantages and drawbacks of each technique are identified and energy utilization efficiency is calculated for different weather conditions. Practical results obtained using a 540Wp PV experimental setup show very good agreement with numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "The use of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based HVDC transmission has been strongly suggested for the interconnection of various power networks. However, VSCs susceptibility to DC faults, particularly the potential damage caused to the converter IGBTs due to overcurrent, is an issue that must be addressed. This paper analyses the behaviour of a VSC-based HVDC system under varying DC fault conditions. A two terminal multi-terminal DC system, consisting of a single sending and receiving end is used as a case study. Recharging of the DC link Capacitor after a DC line-to-line fault was found to act as additional damping for the AC fault current, helping to reduce the AC current offset. Also, it was discovered that the development of potential earth loops with the system as a result of DC lineto-earth faults can lead to substantial overcurrent if an effective earthing scheme is not in place.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines methods of control schemes of multiterminal VSC-HVDC systems for offshore wind farm integration. Modelling strategies of droop DC voltage characteristics for grid side converters are analysed in detail. Differences between voltage-current and voltage-power characteristics are briefly described. A four-terminal VSCHVDC model with three onshore terminals is established in simulation to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the DC grid. Multiple voltage-current characteristics are designed for the four-terminal system to maintain the stability of the DC system. Different control scenarios are investigated and compared using dynamic simulations including wind power variations and a loss of a converter.",

Various factors including the evolution of cable technology will lead to a variety of DC voltages and a need to provide a DC/DC step up/down at high power ratings (beyond 500 MW). This paper analyses a High Voltage (HV) DC/DC converter utilising an intermediate AC link between two modular multi-level converters (MMC) based on the Alternate Arm Converter (AAC) topology. System operation is demonstrated using a detailed Simulink simulation. Power loss estimates derived from the simulation are used to illustrate the dependence of efficiency on design choices and operating point. Furthermore, the system is shown to block a DC-side fault and prevent its affect propagation through the system.",

The aforementioned premises have created a favorable frame for development of distributed energy resources. As a result, the level of integration of distributed generation (DG) technologies, especially in distribution networks has increased. In order to counteract the impact of DG on the stability and reliability of power systems, the transmission and distribution systems operators have started to reconsider and update their national grid codes. This paper provides an overview of the most recent and comprehensive grid codes regarding the DG integration at distribution level.",

The second structure is simpler for practical realisation, since the problem of capacitor voltage balancing does not arise. This paper develops a space vector PWM (SVPWM) algorithm for the dual-inverter six-phase supply, based on two two-level six-phase voltage source inverters (VSIs), feeding a symmetrical six-phase load. In the algorithm, each inverter is controlled using SVPWM technique that was previously developed for a single-sided supply configuration. A multilevel output voltage is produced for a certain range of modulation index. The performance of the algorithm is verified through simulations and experiments.",

This paper analyses the behaviours of different LOE protection schemes, such as R-X, G-B, P-Q and U-I schemes, for a hydro generator, which is connected to an infinite bus. Based on the simulation results, the reliability and stability of existing LOE protection schemes are compared and a preferred scheme is selected. An improvement to the scheme is also proposed to prevent the LOE relay incorrect operation during external faults, such as short-circuit faults on busbar or transmission lines.",

However, in certain occasions (e.g., in a microgrid or in a weak system), the PV cannot always operate on the MPPT mode but on the dispatchable mode for some time, due to the top priority of the system stability. To this end, a Newton quadratic interpolation based control strategy for the PV system is presented in this paper. With this novel strategy, the PV system can work on the dispatchable mode to flexibly adjust the active power output in some range, and it will automatically switch to the MPPT mode if necessary. The proposed control strategy is verified by simulation.",

The confirmed detections of the air targets at long range (up to 300 km monostatic range) has been obtained using the PaRaDe (Passive Radar Demonstrator). The PaRaDe is a deployable system operating in real time, developed at Warsaw University of Technology, Poland. The results of the long range detection of the air targets obtained using PaRaDe system, show new capabilities of the passive radar technology.",

        "abstract": "One of the main intent of smart grid is to enable more renewable energy resources. Installing the DGs near end-customers result in reduction of power transmission of lines, however, if a large amount of microDGs generate energy simultaneously, it may result in distribution system congestion. In usual, distribution component capacity is considered high enough to avoid any congestion. However, considering the on-line monitoring and controlling abilities of a smart grid, this paper addressed reconfiguration as an effective methodology to solve the distribution network congestion problem. Genetic algorithm is used to determine the optimal configuration. Numerical results of implementing the method on a test system demonstrate that network reconfiguration can be used as an effective methodology to defer the additional investment in distribution systems.",

        "abstract": "Research and development within piezoelectric transformer (PT) based converters are rapidly increasing, as the technology is maturing and starts to prove its capabilities. High power density and high efficiencies are reported and recently several inductor-less converters have emerged [1][2][7][10][13], which demonstrates soft switching capabilities. The elimination of a bulky inductor, reduces size and price of the converter, but demands a soft switching optimised PT. Several attempts of expressing the soft switching capability have been made [5][12], with some shortcomings. The goal of this paper is to derive a simple expression of the maximal obtainable soft switching capability (ZVS factor), for a specific PT design, assuming a matched load. The expression has been derived through series of parametric sweep simulations of the inductor-less half- bridge topology, which revealed that a linearization of the maximal soft switching capability can be performed, in the area of interest. This expression is intended to form a basic tool for development of soft switching optimised PT's, which enables the utilisation of inductor-less topologies.",

Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.",

        "abstract": "Modular multilevel converters, based on cascading of halfbridge converter cells, can combine low switching frequency with low harmonic interference. They can be designed for high operating voltages without direct series connection of semiconductor elements. This has led to a rapid adoption within high-power applications such as high voltage direct current transmission. However, the overall hardware expenditure is generally greater than for conventional converters. Improving the operating range in the PQ-plane of the converter is thus desirable. In this work it is shown that optimisation of the internal variables of the converter can increase the power handling capability significantly for a given set of rating constraints. In this process optimal values for the circulating currents, the zero-sequence ac-side voltages and the average stored energy are sought. Also, a control algorithm is demonstrated by which the converter can be operated in the optimised operating point. Simulation results clearly indicate the feasibility of the proposed methodology.",

With the aid of 2D finite element analysis (FEA), the torque waveform, cogging torque, back-emf and d- and q-axis inductances are investigated and compared with emphasis on the torque-speed characteristics. In conventional SFPM machines, the influence of stator/rotor pole combination on the torque-speed characteristics is also investigated through 12/10, 12/13 and 12/14 SFPM machines. Compared with conventional SFPM machines, which exhibit limited speed range, infinite speed range is observed in multi-tooth, E-core and C-core SFPM machines, among which the highest average torque per ampere is achieved in E-core SFPM machine, albeit with relatively high torque ripples.",

        "abstract": "There has been much discussion over how HVDC grids incorporating many converters should be controlled and several methodologies have been proposed. An underlying principle of a proposed method, Voltage Droop control, was the minimisation of the inter-dependency of the control of the individual converters, inferring little, or no, reliance on a communication system. Since then further work has shown that the philosophy's fundamental principles were correct and it was applicable to multi-converter systems. Nevertheless, further work has led to refinements that enhance the basic concept to include converters operating with different control modes and system objectives. These developments are described in this paper.",

The proposed voltage sag detection is also based on abc-dq transformation as conventional synchronously rotating reference frame (CSRRF)-based voltage sag detection but adding of 2ω component eliminator (2ω component is generated by synchronously rotating reference frame-based transformation in unbalance voltage sag conditions) and dedicated band-stop filter (BSF) (to exclude the effect from harmonic voltages in practical grid voltages) then very fast voltage sag detection time under practical grid voltages condition is achieved. The computer software simulation and the experimentation are made to investigate and verify the operation of proposed voltage sag detection. The detection time of FSRRF-based voltage sag detection is around one eighth of CSRRF-based voltage sag detection in the case of single-phase voltage sag and around one fifth in the case of two-phase voltage sag. This voltage sag detection can be used in any voltage sag or interruption compensation systems to improve their performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper is the first in a series dedicated to investigating the airflow and thermal management of electrical machines. Due to the temperature dependent resistive losses in the machine's windings any improvement in cooling provides a direct reduction in losses and an increase in efficiency. This paper focuses on the airflow which is intrinsically linked to the thermal behaviour of the machine as well as the windage power consumed to drive the air through the machine. A full CFD model has been used to analyse the airflow around all major components of the machine. Results have been experimentally validated and investigated. At synchronous speed the experimentally tested mass flow rate and torque were under predicted by 4% and 30% respectively by the CFD. A break-down of torque by component shows that the fan consumes approximately 87% of the windage torque.",

        "abstract": "With increasing offshore wind generation, there is a strong argument for implementing a multi-terminal DC grid offshore by the interconnection of individual HVDC links. The point of intersection of three or more lines can be used to interconnect projects with different voltage levels and to control power distribution. It is being proposed that these points, or nodes, be implemented using DC devices. A high-voltage, high-power DC/DC converter will therefore be an important component of a DC node. This paper reviews possible DC/DC converter topologies, looking at device requirement, different voltage conversion ratio and fault management. The suitability of the converters considered, for use in a node in a HVDC offshore grid, is discussed. A resonant DC/DC converter topology is considered in detail and is modelled at a conversion ratio of two, and demonstrates high power efficiency.",

The phase-locked loop (PLL) technique is considered as the state of art in providing phase and frequency information for DPGSs. This paper presents quantified analyses and comparisons of the main PLL techniques based on different structures for both single phase and 3-phase systems. The fundamentals of different phase locking principles are explained. Performance of different PLLs when subjected to various distortions is compared based on quantified PSCAD simulation results. The performance of the PLL module of the PSCAD software package has also been investigated.",

        "abstract": "This paper is part of a project which aims to research the opportunities for the re-use of batteries after their primary use in low and ultra low carbon vehicles on the electricity grid system. One potential revenue stream is to provide primary/secondary/high frequency response to National Grid through market mechanisms via DNO's or Energy service providers. Some commercial battery energy storage systems (BESS) already exist on the grid system, but these tend to use costly new or high performance batteries. Second life batteries should be available at lower cost than new batteries but reliability becomes an important issue as individual batteries may suffer from degraded performance or failure. Therefore converter topology design could be used to influence the overall system reliability. A detailed reliability calculation of different single phase battery-to-grid converter interfacing schemes is presented. A suitable converter topology for robust and reliable BESS is recommended.",

        "abstract": "The use of in-wheel motors as a source of propulsion for electric vehicles is particularly attractive because they offer new levels of controllability in the vehicle, whilst also freeing up space within the main body of the car. The in-wheel motor is housed in the rim, alongside existing mechanical brakes and suspension systems. This produces tight space constraints, so that the motor and drive electronics must both be power dense and compact. The motor must also offer high efficiency, low cogging torque and be intrinsically fail safe. This paper examines the design options for a direct drive in-wheel motor for use in passenger and light commercial vehicles. The study focuses on achieving high torque density whilst considering magnetic, mechanical, electrical and physical limitations posed on the motor.",

        "abstract": "This paper present a novel control scheme for a grid connected PV generator that contributes to the frequency and voltage regulation of a power system. The PV generator consists of a PV panel connected to a DC/AC converter via a DC-DC boost converter. The frequency regulator controls the boost converter and the voltage regulator controls the DC/AC converter. The proposed frequency regulator includes a frequency control module that changes the reference signal of a power control module when the frequency deviation is significant. An adaptive control scheme is employed to find the frequency control module equation and a nonlinear control scheme is used to find the active power control module equation. A backstepping control design method is employed to obtain the proposed voltage regulator equations. It consists of a module that uses the voltage deviation to generate the reference for a q-axis current controller. A module that maintains the DC-link voltage is also included. A backstepping control design method is also employed to find its equations. The proposed control system is evaluated in simulation.

        "abstract": "In the next 20 years the number of electric vehicles (EV) will exponentially increase. That will be mostly due to governments and car manufacturers which are coordinating the effort to reduce urban pollution and greenhouse gas emission. The energy required for charging EV usually recovering in private parking places for many hours, will be mainly provided through smart charging boxes (“wall box”) managed by the (smart) grid control system of the LV network. In all other cases, EVs will be charged in fast charging stations or battery swap stations connected to the MV network. Such charging stations require high power during the day, especially when the network could be overloaded, hence there is the need to model the impact on the grid. This paper investigates the possibility to use storages to shave peak power demand due to FC stations and the possibility to use these storages to provide additional network services, included the optimization of intermittent-not-programmable energy sources, such as renewable energy.",

        "abstract": "The developments in Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) machines enable higher torque and power densities and higher efficiencies, thus making it a suitable candidate for various applications such as electric road transportation or wind energy generation. Due to the fact that liquids have a higher thermal capacity than air, liquid cooling has been used in high power radial flux electrical machines. This typically involves water being passed through a series of channels in the casing, which will be in thermal contact with the stator. Such a cooling configuration presents a number of thermal resistances between the heat source and the heat sink, limiting the heat transferred and hence the performance of the machine. The knowledge developed for radial flux machines, has been transferred to the design of AFPM machines, with the cooling channels embedded in the stator iron or in the stator plate for single rotor machines. Such liquid cooled machines rely on air-cooling for the copper end windings. The scope of this work is to present a temperature profile for a pole piece for a liquid cooled stator in YASA© electric machine. A high-resolution lumped-capacity thermal model is also presented, and compared to the experiment. The paper shows how a high-resolution model can reveal much more valuable information on the thermal aspects of the stator.",

        "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) with a distributed drive train configuration offer great potential and flexibility for improving the system efficiency, performance, reliability as well as safety. This paper investigates a torque distribution scheme for a front and rear wheel driven EV in order to improve the drive train efficiency over a wide torque and speed range as a part of the EU funded P-MOB project. It has been shown the maximum efficiency is achieved if the total torque required by the vehicle is shared equally between the two identical motors. In addition, the distribution of the energy consumption over a New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) is analyzed and the regions of high speed, low torque are identified to have a high level of energy consumption, where the motor efficiency improvement in these regions is the most important. Therefore, this paper further proposes to operate just one motor to provide the total required torque in the low torque region. A clutch may be employed between one motor and gearbox (differential), thus “switching off” its idle loss (no-load loss, flux-weakening loss), and improving the drive train efficiency. An online optimized torque distribution algorithm has been devised based on the motor efficiency map to determine whether the second motor should be disengaged by the clutch in the low torque region. With the proposed optimization scheme, the drive train efficiency can be improved by 4% over the NEDC cycle. Experimental test results validate the proposed torque distribution strategy.",

This is driven by the continuing focus of environmental concerns, together with an increasing uncertainty about the availability and cost of liquid fuels. The extended cycle life of railway equipment means that decisions influencing traction systems can have lasting consequences of up to 50 years. This article describes the fundamentals of railway vehicle kinematics and then analyses a number of notable recently implemented energy saving strategies. These include regeneration, use of energy storage, train control and optimisation, and operational effects.",

In this paper we describe a novel vocal separator inspired by these approaches which finds the k nearest neighbours to each frame of a spectrogram of the mixture signal. The median value of these frames is then used as the estimate of the background music at the current frame. This is then used to generate a mask on the original complex-valued spectrogram before inversion to the time domain. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a number of real-world signals.",

These techniques help in reducing harmonic content in power supply as well as in controlling output voltage and frequency. The techniques which we have demonstrated are Multiple PWM, Sinusoidal PWM (SPWM), Trapezoidal PWM, Staircase PWM, 60° PWM and Third Harmonic PWM. Though these techniques are very good at reducing lower order harmonics, efficiency of an inverter can't be effectively increased due to the presence of higher order harmonics. To eliminate these harmonics, a filter is designed.",

        "abstract": "In the last two decades there has been a continuous increase in the amount of Distributed Generation (DG) connected to the power network. This has resulted in a number of technical challenges for network protection including: sympathetic tripping of DG interface protection; blinding of feeder over-current (OC) protection; and deterioration of feeder OC protection grading. While the available literature typically analyses the impact of synchronous and induction DG (which is characterised by a high fault current contribution), this paper focuses on the impact of inverter-interfaced distributed generators (which are characterised by low fault current contributions). This paper quantifies the ‘tipping points’ at which protection problems occur by modelling a series of fault scenarios on a typical UK distribution network with inverter-interfaced DG, all simulations have been modelled in PSCAD. The results of this paper suggest that the occurrence of sympathetic tripping is highly dependent on the grid infeed fault level and the inverter-interfaced DGs fault location; protection blinding is unlikely to be a problem on UK power networks as it was not observed in any of the scenarios simulated in this paper; in all cases of protection grading deterioration the grading margin between the protection devices was found to increase meaning the protection devices never operated in an uncoordinated fashion. The tipping point at which these protection issues occurred was evaluated on a typical UK network. The conclusions drawn from these simulations may not be equally valid on future power networks that could employ novel network architectures and higher penetrations of DG.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a remote sensing technique, capable of providing high resolution images independent of weather conditions and sunlight illumination. This makes SAR very attractive for the systematic observation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface. However, current SAR systems are limited, in that a wide coverage can only be achieved at the expense of a degraded azimuth resolution. To overcome this limitation, an innovative concept is considered, Staggered-SAR, where the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is continuously varied. High-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) imaging is thus achieved without the need for a long antenna with multiple apertures.",

The field is applied in the inter-electrode gap where the arc develops. The opening sequence may be separated into two temporal phases. During the first phase, the arc remains stuck at the same position as under zero field. This is ascribed to the existence of a sticking force, which overcomes the Laplace force. The sticking force is related to the high pressure existing in the plasma. During the second phase, the Laplace force dominates. The arc is blown out of the contact region in a time duration of 1 to 1.5 ms. A model is developed which provides a semiquantitative account of the experimental behavior.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the optimal magnet shaping techniques to increase the torque capability in brushless AC machines by utilising the 3rd order harmonic in inverse cosine shape airgap and sinusoidal shape magnet. It is analytically found that for different types of magnet shaping methods, the optimal magnitude of the 3rd order harmonic is always 1/6 of that of the fundamental, which is validated by the finite element analysis. By utilising the optimal 3rd order harmonic, the average torque of two 10-pole/12-slot machine can be increased by ~11%, while their torque ripple is only slightly increased by less than 1.5%, compared to machines employing magnet shaping techniques without the 3rd order harmonic.",

        "abstract": "The classic \"elastic band\" deforms a path generated by a global planner with respect to the shortest path length while avoiding contact with obstacles. It does not take any dynamic constraints of the underlying robot into account directly. This contribution introduces a new approach called \"timed elastic band\" which explicitly considers temporal aspects of the motion in terms of dynamic constraints such as limited robot velocities and accelerations. The \"timed elastic band\" problem is formulated in a weighted multi-objective optimization framework. Most objectives are local as they depend on a few neighboring intermediate configurations. This results in a sparse system matrix for which efficient large-scale constrained least squares optimization methods exist. Results from simulations and experiments with a real robot demonstrate that the approach is robust and computationally efficient to generate optimal robot trajectories in real time. The \"timed elastic band\" converts an initial path composed of a sequence of way points into a trajectory with explicit dependence on time which enables the control of the robot in real time. Due to its modular formulation the approach is easily extended to incorporate additional objectives and constraints.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a synchronous rectifier with a current transformer integrated with the main transformer. This Integrated Synchronous Rectifier is insensitive to parasitic inductance. It is completely self-contained and needs no external power supply. The integrated current transformer reduces circuit joints in the power path and makes the system more compact. A 0.5mΩ soldering joint in 25A current path produces 0.31W loss. A method to integrate the current transformer into the main transformer is explained. A model is suggested to explain the operation principle of the proposed Integrated Synchronous rectifier. An enhanced driving circuit is designed to provide accurate turn on and off timing for the synchronous rectifier MOSFET. A 300W 400V-12V converter is built to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed current driven synchronous rectifier. It can achieve 97.2% efficiency. There is 3.4% efficiency increase compared with schottky diode.",

        "abstract": "The paper addresses important problems related to improvement of probability or equivalently an improvement of range of the detection of targets. The probability of detection of targets can be improved by fusion of non-coherent signals and/or plots from a few independents radars (channels) working in different bands. As an example multiband passive-active radar system working simultaneously in four bands is considered. The paper describes the concept of signal processing in this radar, similar to the MIMO method described in [1]. The fusion of signals is called centralised fusion (detection) and the fusion of plots is called decentralised fusion (detection). The signal processing algorithms described in the paper are based on the original concept that for the fusion of signals (i.e., the centralized fusion) the cueing method is used. It means that signals reflected from targets in multi bands are summed only if the targets have been detected by the decentralised fusion and are being tracked. Thus the centralised fusion takes place around the predicted target positions. The probability of detection versus range curves were calculated by a simulation process for the centralised and decentralised detection (fusion). Quantitative results of these simulations show the possibility for substantial improvement of the target detection probability or equivalently range and compared to single-band radar.",

The overall structure of (C&P) system based on design and realization of system controller(SC), valve base controller (VBC) and sub-module controller (SMC) are proposed. The experimental results are introduced with the dynamic imitation system and Shanghai Nanhui VSC-HVDC demonstration project, which validates the good performance of proposed C&P system both at steady and transient conditions so as to suitable application in practical VSCHVDC project.",

Multi-Level Z-source inverters are single-stage topological solutions used for buck-boost energy conversion with all the favourable advantages of multi-level switching retained. This paper presents three-level trans-Z-source Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) inverter topology, which achieves both the advantages of trans-Z-source and three-level NPC inverter configuration. With proper modulation scheme, the three-level trans-Z-source inverter can function with minimum of six device commutations per half carrier cycle (same as the traditional buck NPC inverter), while maintaining to produce the designed volt-sec average and inductive voltage boosting at ac output terminals. The designed topology and modulation control are tested by Matlab simulation and experimental laboratory prototype with captured results shown in the latter sections.",

First, main features of information and communication systems in Smart Grid are abstracted; the applications of IoTs in Smart Grid are analyzed and classified based on the different function. Then, based on the characters of smart grid systems, reference architecture for Smart Grid IoTs is introduced. Second, main security issues and information security protection requirements of Smart Gird IoTs are well studied. Considering the function of the IoTs application, IoTs in smart grid are classified into three areas with different importance, including electrical industrial control IoTs; gird information collection and process IoTs, and IoTs for power consumer interaction. And classified protection framework of internet of things security is described. The proposed framework can guide the security deployment for Smart Grid IoTs applications. Finally, trusted secure access control system for IoTs terminals is designed for the security protection of Internet of Things in Smart Grid.",

        "abstract": "A novel Concurrent Error Detection technique for the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is proposed in this paper. The technique is similar to the conventional Sum of Squares (SOS) approach but is of lower computational complexity. Complexity reduction is achieved by checking the FFTs of two data blocks in a single calculation. The technique is based on checking the equivalence of the results of time and frequency domain calculations of the first sample of the circular convolution of the two blocks. In the case of error, the FFTs of both blocks must be recomputed. Assuming that errors are rare, this additional cost has negligible impact on the average number of operations per block.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade, bearingless drives have found their way into applications such as pumps for delicate media like blood [1] or sensitive chemicals [9] as well as drives for bioreactors [13] and chemical process chambers [3]. With all these applications running at relatively low speeds below 15.000rpm, the suitability of bearingless drives for high speed operation remained unclear. This paper will give a brief description of a high speed bearingless disc drive, designed to reach speeds beyond 100.000rpm. Aside from special requirements such as rotor material strength and low stator loss characteristics, the control system also faces new tasks arising from the combined motor - bearing unit. Eventually, the operational behaviour of the constructed prototype on the basis of phase current amplitude and resulting rotor orbit is presented.",

        "abstract": "Radar networks require techniques for information fusion, such as track-to-track fusion. However, existing fusion schemes in the literature seldom apply radar-like models, which can have profound effects on performance. Hence, this paper describes and analyses state of the art algorithms for track-to-track fusion assuming range-Doppler radar measurements. The algorithms considered are a central Kalman filter, Naive fusion and variants of the distributed Kalman filter. It is found that when the radar model is applied the distributed Kalman filter with globalised prediction is no longer exact, but feedback from the fusion centre or an approximation based on relaxed evolution can produce close to the optimal performance of a central Kalman filter. These variants of the distributed Kalman filter are preferred, as they do not require full communication.",

        "abstract": "Primary-side sensing is an observer-based approach to estimate the output voltage of flyback converters from a primary winding (or an auxiliary winding). Various observer-laws have been recently developed for flyback converters operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The extension to continuous conduction mode (CCM), however, has not been considered due to the difficulties in compensating for the voltage drop in the secondary winding. From the possibility to predict the winding voltage drop using the magnetizing current and the transformer model, this paper presents a new observer method that can work accurately and smoothly in both CCM and DCM. The methodology can be combined with any controller to provide either output voltage regulation or output current regulation. The proposed sensing technique is verified by simulation.",

Models with different levels of detail have been continuously explored for years. This paper presents a 4.5MW doubly-fed induction generator wind turbine model established in PSCAD/EMTDC with two control levels, the wind turbine control and the DFIG control. Two converter models, a detailed and a simplified model are discussed. Mathematical representations of the closed-loop control systems are developed and verified against the PSCAD/EMTDC model. Simulation studies show good correspondence between the two results. In addition, the dynamic response of a 2-mass shaft model to a wind step is also simulated to examine the effect of torsional oscillations. This model can be employed to evaluate the control scheme, mechanical and electrical dynamics and the fault ride-through capability.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive procedure allows an efficient and fast design of switched reluctance machines (SRM) by understanding the influence of relevant design parameters. So far, guides in literature use empirical values to set parameters, require extensive parameter variation or do not cover the whole design process. This paper addresses the complete electromagnetic dimensioning of rotor and stator geometry. First, the normalized torque production capability of the machine is calculated. Then, reasonable stator and rotor configurations are determined with help of intuitive design parameters. A good design selection is achieved by comparing the results (e.g. power density) of all valid design configurations. The proposed procedure depicts the strong correlation between the operating modes, cooling and outer dimensions of SRM. In conclusion, this procedure reduces the initial design period significantly. Furthermore, it helps to optimize existing designs and question specifications if leading to inefficient designs.",

        "abstract": "Infrared thermography is widely used to monitor the health of electrical power connections in live electrical lines. Although thermal imaging is helpful in locating faulty connections, surface temperature measurement alone is a poor indicator for fault severity assessment. Furthermore, under low load or other adverse environmental situations, the technique may not provide sufficient information to identify electrical connections in the initial or even advanced phases of electrical failure. This limitation stems from the large difference between the temperature of overheated electrical contact spots in a failing electrical interface and the temperature of the external surfaces of the electrical joint. This paper reports the results of calculations, based on a simple computer model, that illustrate the differences between the temperature of an electrical interface and the external surface temperature of the connection.",

        "abstract": "Integrating renewables into grids can expose the system to issues that need addressing lest the functionality of the grid be impaired. Such issues can involve voltage fluctuations, frequency deviations, and deterioration of power quality. To comply with Grid Code requirements, wind farms often require dynamic reactive power compensation. By utilization of FACTS devices such as SVC and STATCOM, grid functionality can be maintained and even improved, enabling increased power transmission capacity over existing lines. The paper treats typical challenges in sub-transmission and distribution grids with considerable wind penetration. A recent case of real life experience is highlighted, where several 69 kV directly connected SVCs were installed for grid stabilization in conjunction with a high degree of wind penetration. Some salient design features of SVC and STATCOM are presented, as well.",

Contributions are made in several aspects of the whole system, including converter design, system simulation, controller programming, and experimental setup. The solar irradiation and temperature are mainly depends on the output power produced from the PV conversion process. Hence the maximum power point of PV array is tracked to maximize the efficiency of Photovoltaic system. The proposed method of this project is Maximum Power Point Tracker method based on Fuzzy Logic Controller which is applied to a stand-alone PV system. Contributions are made in several aspects of the whole system, including converter design, system simulation, controller programming, and experimental setup. By using this Fuzzy Logic Controller method we get high accuracy around the optimum point when compared to other conventional MPPT algorithms like hill climbing, incremental conductance and perturbation and observation. The proposed system consists of a standalone PV system, DC/DC Boost converters, Fuzzy Logic Controller and a load. Converter regulates voltage and current to provide a continuous maximum power to the load. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy logic controller applied for the PV system. MATLAB and Simulink were employed for simulation studies.",

The motivation for this work is to demonstrate novel methods to allow radar systems to adapt to an increasingly crowded RF spectrum. An approach for generating constant modulus waveforms which possess spatial and/or frequency nulls, Re-iterative Uniform Weight Optimization (RUWO), is discussed. RUWO generates constant modulus radar waveforms with spatial, frequency, or space-frequency nulls for MIMO transmit arrays by utilizing the maximum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) framework in a re-iterative fashion. The paper presents experimental results from eight channels at baseband and four channels at X-band in loop-back configuration for both cases.",

        "abstract": "Aiming at the problems which were brought by wind power integration, it is important to enhance the low voltage ride-through (LVRT) performance of wind turbines in order to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the power system. For the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbines, crowbar is a commonly used protection method to implement the LVRT capability. Based on analyzing the electric characteristic of the stator and rotor currents during the grid voltage dips in wind turbines with or without crowbar switching, the equation to estimate maximal faulty currents of stator and rotor with crowbar switching is derived. Then a crowbar resistance design method based on the faulty rotor current and the DC-link voltage was proposed, and the specific LVRT control strategy was discussed in this paper. The crowbar resistance can limit rotor fault current, DC-link over-voltage and protect rotor converter effectively during the grid voltage dip. At the same time, reactive power can be fed to the grid through both stator and grid-side converter. A typical 2MW DFIG system was used, the analysis and simulation results show that, with the help of appropriate protective resistor and the reasonable control strategy, the additional crowbar device can effectively help wind generator provide LVRT capability.",

        "abstract": "A systematic approach to identify the vibration and acoustic noise sources in a direct-torque-controlled (DTC) PM BLDC drive is presented and compared with that in BLAC DTC drive. Experimental results show that the acoustic noise may be radiated by the radial vibration of the stator and the vibration of connected mechanical parts due to torque pulsation and stator torsional vibration. In the BLDC DTC prototype drive, the interaction between the field harmonics and PWM switching current harmonics appears to be the dominant source of radial vibration and acoustic noise. If the acoustic noise in both BLDC DTC and BLAC DTC is mainly caused by the interactions between the armature reaction field harmonics themselves, and between the armature reaction field harmonics and PM field harmonics, the BLDC DTC drive is expected to produce higher acoustic noise because the phase current and hence the armature reaction field of BLDC DTC drive is rich of non-triplen odd harmonics. However, if the acoustic noise radiated from BLDC DTC and BLAC DTC drives is largely attributed to PWM switching current harmonic induced vibrations, as found in this paper, the sound pressure level in a BLDC DTC drive may be lower than its BLAC counterpart.",

It allows generation of sinusoidal output voltages and input currents with low harmonic distortion. The work describes in details the design of the proposed finite states model predictive control in conjunction with a full load observer. The proposed matrix converter power supply produces unity input power factor and a perfect tracking of the sinusoidal output voltage, accurately following the imposed reference in the presence of a linear load. A simulation study is presented to validate the proposed control scheme.",

This modified algorithm is applied to a single-phase PV system based on deadbeat control in order to test the tracking accuracy and its impact on the reliability of the whole system. Both simulations and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm offers a fast response as well as smaller steady-state oscillations even under low irradiance condition compared with classical methods.",

In the current work we present a multistatic, multi frequency band, commensal, Radar system architecture and a suite of tools to design and implement such a system. The system we describe consists of spatially distributed transmitters and receivers, operating at different frequencies. The receivers do not process the direct signal, which is recorded independently, and shared by network. We outline the simulation tools we have developed to assist in the deployment of this technology in the most operationally effective way. These tools include multisite radar simulation and modelling of multistatic radar cross section and propagation using terrain elevation models.",

Using theoretical analysis of simple BDFM rotors this paper establishes trends in how rotor structures determine the rotor's equivalent circuit resistance, leakage inductance and turns ratio. The variation in measured parameters of five prototype rotors is then analysed in light of the trends found. Both the theory and experimental results suggest a significant performance advantage in using cage+loops type rotors as opposed to the simple nested loop type more usually employed.",

This family of waveforms extends the high performance serial tone modem technology of the MIL-STD-188-110B standard to wider bandwidths and much higher data rates, allowing users the option of selecting the bandwidth and modulation so as to optimize modem performance under the prevailing HF channel characteristics. However, fully realizing the potential of these new waveforms will require enhanced capabilities in other elements of an HF communications system, notably including a new `Fourth Generation' (`4G') Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) capability. This paper discusses requirements and design objectives for such a 4G-ALE technique, sketches some candidate 4G-ALE design concepts, and reports early results from on-air testing aimed at verifying the suitability and feasibility of these design concepts.",

IPC regulates the input filter capacitor voltage and OPC, the tank capacitor voltage. The resonant converter corresponds to a three phase to single phase matrix converter which feeds a resonant tank (SRPL). Both predictive strategies allow soft commutations, thus, minimizing the switching losses. Previous work has analysed the effects of the control choice on an AC voltage power supply only. The main contribution of this paper is the consideration of the effect of the control choice on the input current as well HVDC quality produced by the power supply.",

The partial cross-coupling model, which considers that the PM flux is a function of q-axis current and the d- and q-axis inductances are functions of d- and q-axis currents, respectively, is simple but neglects the saturation to some extent. However, as shown by the frozen permeability method in this paper, it can accurately predict the torque-speed characteristics of fractional-slot PM machines having concentrated windings. The analysis is confirmed by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Short-term traffic prediction is an important area in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) research. A number of ITS applications such as Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS), Dynamic Route Guidance (DRG) and Urban Traffic Control (UTC) can benefit from improved prediction of traffic variables for the short-term future. Traffic prediction during abnormal condition, such as incidents, is especially important to these applications. However, this is an area not well-researched. This paper presents a novel improvement to a k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) based traffic predictor with Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique based data preprocessing. This SSA-kNN framework is implemented for short-term traffic prediction under both normal and incident traffic conditions. A key feature of this approach is the data pre-processing step, which is designed to accommodate the extremely noisy sensor inputs that arise during incident conditions. This paper compares the prediction accuracy of the SSA-kNN approach with three other commonly used machine learning methods, kNN, Grey System Model (GM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Moreover, the sensitivity of traffic prediction accuracy to various kNN design parameters is explored. The results show that the proposed SSA-kNN based approach has the best prediction accuracy among the methods used in this study, especially during non-recurring incidents. The concept behind the proposed method can be extended to other machine learning tools to improve the accuracy of short-term traffic forecasting models.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a recovery strategy for wind energy-fed voltage source converter high voltage DC transmission systems, capable of maintaining power balance between the AC and DC sides during different AC faults. This prevents the DC link voltage rise as a result of trapped energy. This reduces the voltage and current stresses on the switching devices. Also, the strategy ensures the converters remain connected to the AC network to provide the necessary voltage support, within the converter reactive power capability. The recovery strategy is implemented by introducing a flywheel energy storage system based on induction machine in parallel with the grid side inverter. Due to the parallel combination of the grid side inverter and flywheel induction machine (FW-IM), the trapped energy in the DC link during AC faults can be eliminated; as a result of finding another path for the power of the wind turbines during AC faults. To illustrate the feasibility of the proposed HVDC system, this paper assesses its dynamic performance during steady-state and network alterations, including its response to AC side faults.",

Special focus is put on the fault-tolerant electrical machine as a major component in the system. The novelty consists of the detailed machine optimisation in conjunction with the main actuator components: gearbox, screw, converter and filters. An exemplary EMA concept for a primary flight control system for medium weight helicopters is presented and the implications on the fault-tolerance requirements of actuator and electrical machine are elaborated. A deterministic optimisation strategy is presented alongside with models for the main actuator components. A dynamic Reluctance Network (RelNW) and a Thermal Network (ThermNW) are combined to represent the behaviour of the electrical machine. The paper will show the importance of low inertia design and machine operation in magnetic saturation due to high peak-to-rated torque ratio and acceleration requirements.",

This paper presented a new method for accurate acquirement of contact resistance and temperature rise based on rough surface contact model and finite element simulation. The relation between contact resistance and contact force was developed with the surface profile and the separation between reference planes of contacting surfaces. An equivalent contact model was built with the separation and real contact area in 3-D thermal-electrical coupled finite element simulation to acquire contact temperature rise. Experiments were conducted to verify this method. The research would provide an accurate and effective method for calculation of contact resistance and simulation of contact temperature rise.",

        "abstract": "Hysteretic modulators exhibit superior dynamic performance and without sacrificing the transient response they help to reduce the number of output capacitors. Due to tight regulation requirements modern point-of-load converters have very small output ripple. This small output ripple fails to generate a suitable piece-wise linear modulation waveform for the hysteretic comparator. This paper presents a fully digital Synthetic Ripple Modulator (SRM) comprising of a hysteretic comparator, a ripple synthesizer, and a voltage error amplifier for tight output voltage regulation. The ripple synthesizer realizes a high-quality low-cost current sensors by creating a piece-wise linear synthetic ripple using sensed converter voltages. This artificial ripple is then added to the output voltage and fed as a carrier to the hysteretic comparator. This improves the large signal dynamics of the converter, especially in low voltage application. Analysis and experimental results on a 2 V/10 A, 20 W single phase prototype are presented to verify the operation of the proposed digital SRM.",

        "abstract": "Critical components of a system denote to those which have considerable influences on its both technical and economical performance. This paper is concentrated on the identification of critical components in power distribution systems, more from a reliability viewpoint, to be planned for maintenance schedules. A new straightforward scheme is proposed based on the common load point reliability indices which can easily get through the components prioritization. The presented scheme can then mathematically find the most critical ones to be put under reliability centered maintenance (RCM). Since the maintenance plans are then applied where necessary, the proposed method helps in more effectively reaching the benchmarked reliability indices of a distribution utility, with the minimum costs and the maximum benefits. The effectiveness and applicability of the offered scheme are finally reflected in its application on a real distribution system, i.e. Swedish distribution network belonging to the BIRKA Nat distribution system in the Stockholm City area.",

The results obtained from the experimental work are used to derive an empirical correlation which is subsequently used to predict the total thermal energy stored in a magnet after a speed varying torque load. The results of an uncertainty analysis are offered in order to show the usefulness of the technique. An axial flux permanent magnet machine has been used as a case study in this work, though the methodology could certainly be applied to other topologies.",

        "abstract": "The utility-grid connection of a photovoltaic (PV) generator can be implemented by using a single or double-stage inverter. The single-stage inverter is connected directly to the PV generator, which is observed to significantly change the control dynamics of the inverter depending on the operating point. In the double-stage scheme, a dc/dc converter - operating either at open loop or under input-voltage-feedback control - is connected between the PV generator and the inverter. This paper investigates the effect of the dc/dc converter on the interfacing effects of the PV generator. The investigations show that the input-voltage-feedback control has clearly a stabilizing effect on the DC-link-voltage feedback control but the open-loop converter does not change the situation.",

These two configurations are optimized individually and compared in this paper based on surface-mounted PM (SPM) machines. The optimal split ratio and flux density ratio are derived analytically for both topologies. The analytical models are verified by finite element (FE) analyses. Their optimal designs are compared when they have the same overall size and copper loss. It shows that the OR designs have significantly higher split ratio while the IR designs require much higher flux density ratio for the maximum torque. For SPM applications, the OR designs exhibit higher torque than IR designs.",

Therefore, with the advent of wind power, distribution systems would have locally looped networks with bi-directional power flow, which may impose serious implications for network power quality, protection settings, and etc. Storage facilities can provide a number of benefits that will help with the integration of large amounts of wind power, such as capacity firming and load shifting. In this paper, an optimal allocating scheme for battery energy storage device in distribution system is proposed. The energy storage system can be used to absorb the curtailed wind power in order to avoid violating system constraints, to alter the energy usage patterns, and to reduce the system power losses. Detailed case study is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Distributed multisensor networks constructed of homogeneous sensors, sometimes called Multiple-Input-Multiply-Output (MIMO), offer several advantages compared to classical monostatic radars. As they illuminate targets from various aspects angles and as reflections are received from several locations simultaneously these distributed homogeneous sensor networks easily outperform Single-Input-Single-Output (SISO) systems. Target detection and parameter estimation is dramatically improved due to this spatial diversity. Hence, such homogeneous sensor networks are attracting more and more researchers. This paper proposes a homogeneous sensor network composed of several distributed Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) routers as transmitters and dedicated receivers for detecting multiple targets and estimating their location and velocity with high accuracy. Compressed sensing is applied to reduce the sample rate dramatically, which has to be transferred to a central processing unit.",

The inset PM motor considered is a 12-slot 10-pole motor, whose performance has been obtained by means of both finite elements simulations and experimental measurements. It will be shown that the motor presents good performance to be controlled by sensorless techniques, and the expected performance agree with the experimental results.",

The availability of these HVDC transmission schemes is a key factor in determining if these offshore windfarms are commercially and technically viable. This paper shows that a typical radial HVDC link would have an energy availability of 96.5% based on estimated reliability indices from publically available data and that the submarine cable is the component which has the greatest effect on the scheme's availability. The regional HVDC grid analysed in this paper is shown to have a higher energy availability than an equivalent radial scheme, providing additional capacity is built into the grid. Furthermore, cost-benefit analysis shows the link between a scheme's availability and profitability.",

In this paper, the performance of SiC JFETs for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) applications is investigated at heatsink temperatures of 100°C. The thermal runaway characteristics, maximum current density and packaging temperature limitations of the devices are considered and the efficiency implications discussed. To quantify the power density capabilities of power transistors, a novel 'expression of rating' (EoR) is proposed. A prototype single phase, half- bridge voltage source inverter using SiC JFETs is also tested and its performance at 25°C and 100°C investigated.",

This paper presents a joint development of a mobile, X-band, HRR research radar facility, by the research industries of the Centre for Science and Industrial Research (CSIR) (South Africa) and King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) (Saudi Arabia). The radar employs true wideband processing in its complete RF and IF chain, supporting instantaneous bandwidths of up to 400 MHz. Its intended purpose is to enable rapid measurement campaigns of radar phenomenology that are of interest to target recognition. In this paper an overview of its design, as well as its performance in three representative experiments are presented. The experiments include human gait measurement and ISAR imaging of motor vehicles.",

The proposed approach takes into account all the major uncertainties affecting the magnitude of the fault currents: power load demands, network configurations, fault location, fault impedance, fault type and power productions from distributed generators. In particular, in this paper is analyzed the contribution of the distributed generation both in pre-fault operating conditions and during the fault. Numerical applications are also presented and discussed with reference to a three-phase balanced distribution system including wind farms and a small hydroelectric power plant.",

The switching contacts were tested under conditions typical of MEMS relay applications; 4V, 1-20 mA; with a static contact force 1 mN. The switching characteristics of the surfaces are investigated, with particular focus given to the opening and closing voltage transients.

The feature extraction is performed using principal component analysis (PCA) as it reduces the computational burden. For a given database the features are extracted using PCA. The Olivetti Research Lab (ORL) database is used.The extracted features are divided into training set and testing set. The training data set is used to train both the neural network architectures. Both are tested extensively using testing data. A performance comparison is carried out and presented.",

        "abstract": "Background: The estimation technique Planning Poker is common in agile software development. The cards used to propose an estimate in Planning Poker do not include all numbers, but for example only the numbers 0, ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100. We denote this, somewhat inaccurately, a Fibonacci scale in this paper. In spite of the widespread use of the Fibonacci scale in agile estimation, we do not know much about how this scale influences the estimation process. Aim: Better understanding of the effect of going from a linear scale to a Fibonacci scale in effort estimation. Method: We conducted two empirical studies. In the first study, we gave computer science students the same estimation task. Half of the students estimated the task using the Fibonacci scale and the other half a linear scale. The second study included four estimation teams, each composed of four software professionals, estimating the effort to complete the same ten tasks. Two of the teams estimated the first five tasks using the Fibonacci scale and the last five using the linear scale. The two other teams used the scales in the opposite sequence. Results: We found a median decrease in the effort estimates of 60% (first study) and 26% (second study) when using a Fibonacci scale instead of the traditional linear scale. The scale difference in the effort estimates decreased as the developers' skill increased. Conclusion: The use of a Fibonacci scale, and possibly other non-linear scales, is likely to affect the effort estimates towards lower values compared to linear scales. A possible explanation for this scale-induced effect is that people tend to be biased towards toward the middle of the provided scale, especially when the uncertainty is substantial. The middle value is likely to be perceived as lower for the Fibonacci than for the line",

This paper highlights important design aspects of wideband DRFM design on printed circuit board (PCB) and also presents the architecture of the DRFM that was implemented using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The spurious-free-dynamic-range (SFDR) of the DRFM was characterised as −47 dBc worst-case over an instantaneous bandwidth of 800 MHz. Target returns generated by the DRFM and an optical delay line (ODL) were measured using an experimental pulse Doppler radar and are presented in this paper.",

Based on the wide review of solutions developed in the past, this paper proposes a novel protection strategy, with the main protection method based on the time and polarity features of initial current travelling waves using mathematical morphology (MM) technology and backup protection strategy based on the rate of change of current. Simulation tests in PSCAD/EMTDC considering different fault resistances, fault positions and fault inception angles prove this protection approach to be sensitive and reliable.",

        "abstract": "A simple algebraic approach to synthesis Fibonacci Switched Capacitor Converters (SCC) is analyzed and the expected losses are estimated. The proposed approach reduces the power losses by increasing the number of target voltages. The synthesized Fibonacci SCC is compatible with the binary SCC and uses the same switch network. This feature is extremely beneficial since it provides the option to switch between the binary and Fibonacci target voltages, increasing thereby the resolution of attainable conversion ratios. The theoretical results were verified by experiments.",

This paper combined artificial neural network and regression modelling methods to predict electrical load. We propose an approach for specific day, week and/or month load forecasting for electrical companies taking into account the historical load. Therefore, a modified technique, based on artificial neural network (ANN) combined with linear regression, is applied on the KSA electrical network dependent on its historical data to predict the electrical load demand forecasting up to year 2020. This technique was compared with extrapolation of trend curves as a traditional method (Linear regression models). Application results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective. The application of neural networks prediction shows the capability and the efficiently of the proposed techniques to obtain the predicting load demand up to year 2020.",

        "abstract": "In standalone dc system, dc-dc converter is used to interconnect solar photovoltaic (pv) and battery. To utilize solar pv to fullest, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is incorporated in controller. However, in case when the state of charge (SoC) of battery is high and system is partially loaded, excess power flows into the battery, thereby reducing the life of battery. Technique suggested in literature use output (battery) voltage controllers. However, it is shown in this paper that output voltage controlled dc-dc converter fed by solar pv may lead to instability. To address these limitations, a charge controller scheme is proposed in this paper. This scheme ensures that the battery voltage remains below its gassing voltage. Salient features of the proposed scheme are optimal utilization of solar pv and battery capacities without effecting life of battery. The effectiveness of the scheme is verified through detailed simulation study. To confirm the viability of the scheme, experimental studies are carried out on a scaled-down laboratory prototype developed for the purpose.",

Time resolved frequency maps were obtained using a real-time spectrum analyzer (RSA) to show how polarity, electrode material and current magnitude affected the measured RF current intensity. These dc signatures were also compared to previously obtained ac signatures using the same materials and methods to show differences between ac and dcarcing. This work is useful to those who want to gain an understanding of RF currents generated in arcs, especially for those developing arc fault sensing devices. Examples of dc systems represent systems built to meet North American standards, but the underlying physics and results can apply to any country.",

This paper explains how DC side harmonic currents are produced by PWM inverters and how they interact with the capacitors and cable inductances on the system. When multiple PWM drives are connected together there are multiple resonant frequencies and avoiding resonances may be impossible. A example design is done which shows that the inherent losses in Electrolytic capacitors can sometimes provide sufficient damping but that the optimum design of low loss Metalised film capacitors does not work with out additional damping resistors or eliminating the dc bus inductance. A full DC harmonic study is necessary combining all the harmonics sources and the multiple natural system resonances to have a better understanding of how much damping is required and where to add it.",

The factors inducing the oscillations of DC-link voltage of the full-scale frequency converter during grid voltage dips are analyzed. A novel control strategy is proposed to suppresses the DC-link voltage oscillations and enhance the low voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of PMSG-based wind turbine. The generator-side converter is controlled to maintain a stable DC-link voltage, while the grid-side converter is controlled to provide a dynamic coordinated control for the active and reactive power output according to the grid voltage amplitude variations during grid faults. The simulation results implemented in Matlab/Simulink show that the proposed control strategy not only improves the stability of PMSG by means of suppressing the DC-link voltage oscillation, but also provides a dynamic reactive power support to restraint the disturbance of the grid voltage.",

        "abstract": "Teleoperation based space systems have received much attention in the past years.This paper reports the construction and the remote control of a nonholonomic robotic system. The system consists of a three-wheeled mobile platform to keep the robot stable and a 6-DOF articulate manipulator on top of the platform. First, we explain how its design and work, then the kinematic model of the robotic platform is presented considering nonholonomic constraints and the inverse kinematics of the manipulator is described. In order to generate a visualized user interface, we adopt a new development in information technology, which is known as virtual reality (VR). All different movements and manual control of the manipulator are shown in a 3-D virtual environment. Teleoperation is realized by using WiFi to transmit the commands and remote desktop from the lower computer to the upper computer. Finally, experiments prove that the proposed remote operation of the robotic system is reliable and efficient.",

        "abstract": "Locating high-resistance grounding faults poses a tough and challenging problem for the safety of DC railway systems. High-resistance grounding fault current isn't sufficient to trigger switches, which may expand the accident or turn into potential hazards. In order to overcome the limits of the existing methods (such as signal injecting method, resistance method and so), developing a novel fault approach by using both the feeding current and voltage to detect and locate the high-resistance grounding fault in DC railway traction system is necessary. The simulation results prove that the exact fault location can be accurately predicted in this way. Through comparison of several different analysis methods, this paper concludes that with the digital signal processing the location can be executed more precisely. Extensive simulations with diverse fault conditions are performed to verify the means.",

        "abstract": "Small size quad-rotor helicopters are often used due to the simplicity of their construction and maintenance, their ability to hover and also to take-off and land vertically. The first step in control development is an adequate dynamic system modelling, which should involve a faithful mathematical representation of the mechanical system. This paper presents a detailed dynamic analytical model of the quad-rotor helicopter using the linear Taylor series approximation method. The developed analytical model was simulated in the MatLab/Simulink environment and the dynamic behaviour of the quad-rotor assessed due to voltage changes. The model is further calibrated and linearized for use on any quad-rotor helicopter.",

        "abstract": "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the most favored modulation technique in multicarrier wireless communications. Recently, the Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) modulation scheme has drawn attention due its low Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR), which makes it especially suitable for Cognitive Radio (CR) applications. In multicarrier schemes the large dynamic range of the signal is a common problem, both FBMC and OFDM signals have high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). If nonlinear distortions are present, this large PAPR can lead to spectral regrowth causing harmful interference in the neighboring frequency bands. In this paper clipping-based PAPR-reduction schemes aided to reduce the PAPR of FBMC signal are presented. A comparison is given for both transmitter and receiver oriented methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a Multi-agent System (MAS) approach to coordinate overcurrent relays, aiming to protect distribution systems with distributed generators. The connection of distributed generation (DG) units causes a reduction in the efficacy of protection systems coordination and, in some cases, an increase of operating times. Coordination studies aim to guarantee the protection selectivity in a diversity of fault situations, also considering topological changes. Consequently, sometimes a correct protection operation at every point of the system in every possible situation cannot be guaranteed. The proposed MAS uses communication between agents to achieve on-line coordination. In order to evaluate the approach, simulation tests of a real system were executed and the protection operating times using the proposed methodology are compared with the operating time of existing relays. Results show that this approach provides a noticeable reduction of protection operating time and there is also an improvement of selectivity.",

        "abstract": "All humans have the ability to exploit acoustic echoes for cognitive sensing of the environment. There are blind people who use active versions of the technique as an augmentation to the long stick and can even perform remarkable tasks such as riding a bicycle. Those who are expert in this practise can evaluate range, location, size, shape and texture of objects. This provides a very powerful basis for perception and cognition and is somewhat beyond that which is routinely achieved by radar systems. This example of “sight by sound” makes an ideal candidate to study in order to understand and articulate the cognitive methods used. Subsequently artificial forms of cognition can be synthesised and applied to radar and sonar sensing. In this paper we report on an initial examination of human echolocation by presenting and analysing transmitted and received waveforms generated via “tongue-clicking”.",

        "abstract": "This presentation will summarize work on the Pacific Northwest Smart Grid Demonstration Project. A key element of the project is development and implementation of a technique referred to as transactive control. Transactive control will provide a means of coordinating the response of smart grid assets at all levels of the power system. In simple terms transactive control may be thought of as extending the notion of locational marginal pricing throughout the power system from generation to end-use. The transactional nature of the technique, however, introduces a new element in the use of a pair of signals to implement an equivalent to market closing distributed in space and time.",

        "abstract": "Increasing complexity of power grid and its management, increase in demand and service quality expectations such as greater grid reliability, efficiency and security concerns have stimulated to Smart Grids that use bi-directional communication with the consumer to enable an information-driven approach to distributed energy management. Smart metering is one of the smart grid applications. The main problem with \"smart meter\" adoption is that trust is lacking in the actual \"smart meters\". Clouds computing offer features well suited for Smart Grid software platforms in computation storage, combining of information, analysis, and applications, such as elastic resources and shared services. However, the security and privacy concerns inherent in an information rich Smart Grid environment are further exacerbated by their deployment on Clouds. This paper focuses on proposing the Trustworthy Clouds or TCLOUDS on the smart power grid that will prove the simplest way such energy-preserving systems could be migrated to a cloud infrastructure while enhancing their resistance, privacy protection and tolerance, from both hackers and hardware issues.",

This paper builds the lowest-cost optimization model, considering investment, operating costs of system and environmental governance as well as two operation modes, isolated and grid-connected operation, and proposes the scheduling strategy of the hybrid generation, with the aim to realize the best configuration of output power of the three resources. Simulation results indicate that the optimal operation and scheduling strategy can assess the economical performance of the system in different operation modes, thus improve the reliability and flexibility of the hybrid system.",

        "abstract": "A multi-scale fuzzy c-means method integrated with particle swarm optimization (MsFCM-PSO) is proposed for ultrasound image segmentation. First, speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion is used to suppress noise in an ultrasound image and construct a series of images at multiple scales. Then the particle swarm optimization is incorporated into the multi-scale fuzzy c-means (MsFCM) to search for the global optima of cluster centers and update the membership of each pixel in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Finally, the image is segmented by assigning each pixel to the cluster with the highest membership. The method was validated on both synthetic and in vivo ultrasound images. It outperformed the traditional fuzzy c-means methods including MsFCM by 39.6% and 13.6%, in terms of the Pratt's figure of merit and segmentation accuracy, respectively. These results demonstrate that the MsFCM-PSO can provide an accurate tool for ultrasound image segmentation.",

The new topology provides a solution for an inverter with inherent step-up and step-down behaviour especially suitable for grid connected PV systems. The main advantages of this inverter are simple symmetrical control, flexible grounding configuration and high efficiency over a wide input voltage range. To prove these features, a theoretical analysis of the proposed circuit is performed first. Then design approaches and optimizations of the circuit components are explained. Finally a constructed and tested 2.5kW prototype will be presented and measured results of the proposed single phase transformerless PV inverter are shown.",

        "abstract": "Photo voltaic power generation has an important role to play due to the fact that it is a green source. After their installation they generate electricity from the solar irradiation without emitting greenhouse gases. Electrical energy presently comprises about fifteen percent of energy demand in the world, but this percentage is considerably higher for developed societies and tends to increase. Electricity consumption is strongly correlated with economic growth; economic growth allows further use of electric appliances which in turn increases electricity demand. The output power produced by photovoltaic systems is directly related to the amount of solar energy acquired by the system, and so it is extremely important to track the sun's position according to its trajectory with accuracy. In this paper the deigning and implementation of a solar tracker is explained which is using a stepper motor and light sensor and automatically follows sun's trajectory. This tracker can be used for increasing power collection efficiency by tracking the sun. An MPPT solar tracking system has been designed, implemented and presented in this paper.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of HVDC light technology has been a significant step towards developing DC transmission grids. However, all voltage source converters (VSC) employed with HVDC are completely defenceless against DC faults, and significant further technical advances are required to achieve security and reliability levels that exist with AC grids. This paper proposes building DC grids using VSC converters based on LCL passive circuits that enable inherent regulation of DC fault currents. The DC grids with LCL AC/DC converters will not have high DC fault currents and do not require very fast DC fault isolation. The paper describes mechanical DC circuit breakers that can be used at the ends of each DC cable in similar manner and with similar protection systems as with AC transmission systems. The advantage and feasibility of this method in DC fault isolation is studied using a 1GW three terminal HVDC test system simulated on PSCAD platform.",

        "abstract": "The paper discusses the problem of implementing the state observers associated with direct field orientation (DFO) of motor drives using trapezoidal integration (Tustin method). Typically, the discrete-time equations of observers are obtained by emulating the continuous-time equations using the Euler method (forward rectangular rule). With Euler integration, the resulting equations are simple and the real-time implementation requires low computational effort. However, Euler-based observers become inaccurate if a small sampling time cannot used or if the motor drive operates at high frequency-this is because, as the sampling time increases, the Euler approximation of the integral starts losing more and more area from under the curve. The Tustin method (trapezoidal integration) offers an interesting alternative it is theoretically a more accurate integration method, however, it is more complicated. The paper discusses the emulation procedure required to discretize continuous-time observers based on trapezoidal integration. The permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is used as an example of a time-varying plant-the paper develops a trapezoidal integration based observer for the PMSM and compares this with an Euler-based observer in terms of computational complexity and performance. The two observers are simulated comparatively in order to establish the conditions when trapezoidal integration outperforms the Euler method.",

The tracking filter selected for this study is the recursive Gauss-Newton filter based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method. FM Band Commensal Radar (radar that uses another system's EM emissions) produces a Range versus Doppler plot, where the Doppler resolution is very precise due to the long integration time, but range resolution is at best poor due to the narrow broadcast channel bandwidth. Thus, tracking that relies mostly on Doppler seems most sensible for this type of radar.",

        "abstract": "The use of visual sensors (i.e. cameras) in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) as a replacement for the traditional laser range finder may, depending on the application, have several key advantages. These include low price, size, and weight as well as the amount of information that can be gathered about the environment. In this paper, measurements are assumed to be taken from low cost cameras, e.g. the recently launched Microsoft Kinect sensor. Information about the environment will be extracted using sophisticated feature extraction and data association algorithms. Here, the challenge lies in the computational complexity of the image processing algorithms. Therefore, a feature extraction algorithm based on the Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithm will be discussed. Further, a novel efficient and robust data association algorithm for Visual SLAM features will be presented. Initial experiments were conducted in an office environment, showing that the proposed Visual SLAM algorithm achieves precise localization while approaching real-time performance.

We show that we can select a small number of features for indexing using a visual saliency measure without reducing the performance of classifiers trained to find objects.",

Aiming at finding an effective way to design and test the control law for the UAV, a real-time visual flight simulation system is constructed based on FlightGear. In this simulation system, the FlightGear visual module is driven to simulate the real-time 3D UAV model which contains flight states, weather condition and geographic environment. And the fight simulation data is sent to the FlightGear simulator through autopilot I/O port by UDP. This simulation system plays an important role in designing and testing the control law, and has made good effect on validating the control law of the UAV. The simulation results have shown that this visual flight simulation system is economic, valid, feasible, and has great progress on enhancing the efficiency of the project.",

        "abstract": "In multi-hop networks, conventional unipath routing approaches force the data transmission to follow a fixed sequence of nodes. In this paper, we widen this path to create a corridor of forwarding nodes. Within this corridor, data can be split and joined at different nodes as the data travels through the corridor towards the destination node. To split data, decode-and-forward OFDMA is used since with OFDMA, one can exploit the benefits of opportunistically allocating different subcarriers to different nodes according to their channel conditions. To avoid interference, each subcarrier is only allocated once per hop. It is assumed that only local channel state information (CSI) for the next hop towards the destination is available at the nodes, i.e. it can not be guaranteed that a certain node is able to forward its received data in the next hop. This leads to additional transmission phases decreasing the overall network throughput. In this paper, different opportunistic forwarding algorithms are presented which differ in the resource allocation strategy and in the amount of cooperation required between the nodes. Simulations show that in multihop networks, corridor-based routing using opportunistic forwarding with a proper resource allocation strategy outperforms conventional unipath routing approaches in terms of achievable throughput, especially in case of a node drop out.",

The risk increases as greater connection volumes are facilitated by Active Network Management schemes. By incorporating harmonic limits into assessment of the hosting capacity of active networks, this paper demonstrates that by incorporating harmonic levels at the planning stage can prevent inadvertent restrictions on the integration of renewables. Other aspects considered include: the impact of active network controls on harmonic propagation and hosting capacity and the role of active harmonic mitigation methods.",

        "abstract": "Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) have the potential to play an essential role in power system monitoring and operation in the future, particularly for power systems incorporating increasing amounts of distributed generation (DG) and possibly systems operating in islanded mode in the future [1]. Their ability to directly measure and provide the voltage and current phasors at the PMU location offers numerous possibilities for ascertaining information relating to the state and health of the power system. Typical applications of PMUs in distribution networks include: state estimation, dynamic stability supervision, instability prediction and control, protection and fault location, and power quality monitoring [2]. This paper presents a brief overview of the applications of PMU-enabled distribution network functions, with a focus on loss of mains (LOM) protection using a model that is representative of a distribution network incorporating DG. The paper reports on extensive simulations that have been carried out in order to develop a PMU-based system that can detect (very quickly) loss-of mains conditions under situations where local (i.e. potentially islanded) load and DG output is very closely balanced. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the developed PMU-based LOM system can identify and differentiate between load transients, local short circuits and true loss of mains conditions under a variety of different scenarios. Future activities in the project are also presented.",

The least-mean mixed-norm (LMMN) algorithm possesses good performance when the system measurement noise shows distribution with a linear combination of long tails and short tails. In this paper, we combine the famed kernel trick and the LMMN algorithm to present the kernel LMMN (KLMMN) algorithm, which is an adaptive filtering algorithm in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The optimal norm-mixing parameter is derived. To demonstrate the effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed algorithm, we apply the algorithm to nonlinear system identification when the environment noise composed of a linear combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli distributions.",

This is achieved by finding optimal combinations of subkernels, in the least squares sense, which are specific for different regions of the input space. Sufficient conditions for the existence of Wiener solutions for both the monokernel and multikernel approaches are provided, and uniqueness of the multikernel structure is illuminated. The ability of the proposed MKLS to replicate non-homogeneous nonlinear multivariate mappings is illustrated both analytically and by comparison with its monokernel counterpart for the prediction of synthetic benchmark data and real-world body sensor multivariate data.",

        "abstract": "During the recent years, a significant number of modern thermal power plants use natural gas as fuel in order to achieve reduction of their environmental impact from greenhouse gas emissions and increase their efficiency. The new plants are connected to the existing natural gas transmission network leading to a high interdependence between it and the respective electric power system. Therefore, the failure events occurring in the natural gas network can cause interruption of gas supply to one or more power generating units connected to it. This means that there will be a significant impact on the secure and the reliable operation of the power system. For this reason, an additional reliability analysis is required in order to examine the impact of the natural gas network on the operation of the respective power system. The purpose of this paper is to describe an efficient methodology that is based on the Monte - Carlo sequential simulation approach in order to realistically simulate the annual operation of the natural gas transmission systems and calculate the relevant reliability indices of connection nodes for the electric power plants using natural gas. The analysis of a combined system based on the Hellenic electric power system and the natural gas transmission system is presented assuming alternative case studies while the impact of their interdependence is determined. These results are compared and useful conclusions are obtained.",

Analytical expressions are derived to describe the key geometrical properties of the virtual array's manifold, which fully characterises the entire transmit-receive system geometry. A new family of subarrayed collinear MIMO array structures is presented for obtaining uniform linear virtual arrays. It is shown that this reduces the required radar platform size by up to a half, compared to popular existing methods, without reducing virtual array aperture.",

The proposed control system can be implemented on any WECS and requires minimum training for the ANN as well as a small number of artificial neurons. During the training of the ANN, the WECS needs to operate simultaneously with a wind measurement system, until a sufficient amount of data is collected on all operating regions of the wind turbine and the wind turbine characteristics are determined. Next, the ANN is trained, having the rotational speed of the shaft and the power output of the generator as input signals. As a result, the wind turbine can be driven to the optimum rotor speed very fast and with high precision so as the MPPT controller can follow the fast dynamics of the wind speed. Several simulation results are presented for the validation of the effectiveness of the suggested MPPT control scheme and demonstrate the operational improvements.",

Modelling is used to quantify technical and financial benefits of storage over a 10 year period. Technical benefits are achieved through loss reduction, prevention of voltage rise and peak shaving. However, for energy storage to be financially feasible, all multi-stakeholder benefits need to be included in any investment strategy and regulation needs to be updated to foster energy storage adoption.",

An obvious added value of a better know-how of the actual network situation is that networks can be better used, and the suitability and benefits of smart grids solutions can be estimated.

In this study, a concentrated winding electric machine is designed for industrial applications. Although, in concentrated winding, mutual coupling between two adjacent coils is assumed to be zero, finite element analysis indicates that significant coupling may exist. Studies indicate that the coupling phenomena degrades fault tolerant capabilities of the concentrated winding structure. This paper, first, investigates the existence of mutual coupling then presents a new concentrated winding structure which still exploits benefits of conventional concentrated winding.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control scheme for a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) intended for smoothing out the power fluctuation of a grid-connected wind farm. The control goal is to make the FESS with limited capacity to provide energy as more as possible, so that the wind farm output can be smoothed further. In the proposed control scheme, the desired output of wind farm with FESS is determined by a sliding mean filter (SMF) with the wind power series as input. Then, considering the capacity of FESS is finite, a set point corrector is employed to correct the active power set point of FESS according to the state-of-charge (SOC), so as to maintain the speed of flywheel in proper range. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by using the actual power output data of a wind farm, and the simulation results illustrate the satisfying capability of the scheme.",

Also, this paper proposes a new procedure for determining the optimal placement and less numbers of PMUs in distribution network based on the best state estimation criterion. For DSE solution, combination of Nelder-Mead (NM) simplex search and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm have been used. The hybrid method can estimate voltage phasor at each node by minimizing difference between measured and calculated values of state variables and also, it can guarantee observability of distribution system under normal operation conditions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of new procedure, simulation studies are applied on 30-bus radial test feeder. Finally, achievement results for convergence characteristic of DSE solution and estimation error of state variables with regard to the optimal placement and numbers of PMUs in distribution test feeder have been presented.",

The study is addressed to explore the implementation of 60-GHz transceivers in nano-scale CMOS technology. A model of the high data rate physical layer based on the specification released by the consortium WirelessHD has been implemented in MATLAB and the system simulations of the bit error rate have been carried out in order to derive the specifications of the 60-GHz transceiver building blocks. The specifications have been derived by taking into account the capabilities of the 65nm CMOS technology. System simulations take into account also transceiver nonidealities, including the power amplifier nonlinearity, local oscillator phase noise and receiver noise figure. The study also considers phased array implementations. This study, confirms the opportunity offered by nano-scale CMOS process as enabling technology for the implementation of 60-GHz transceivers for wireless high-definition uncompressed video communication system.",

The use of these non-linear methods improves performance. For a fixed false alarm rate of 10%, the technique presented improved detection accuracy from 50% to near 90% over a time adaptive method based on cell-averaging.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel enhancement algorithm for degraded binary document images captured using a low end cell phone camera. The algorithm starts with colour to grey scale conversion followed by contrast stretching. Then single scale retinex enhancement is performed to increase the contrast, reduce global variance and improve the background uniformity of the image. Otsu's binarisation method is then used to dichotomize the image and finally, morphological dilation is performed to preserve stroke connectivity of the document characters by bridging any gaps resulting from the thresholding process. Computer simulation experiments have been used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show a significant improvement over the Otsu's method in terms shadow removal, document legibility and optical character recognition. The results also compare well with the state of the art Sauvola's method results.",

These losses can be reduced by using novel high resistivity materials like plastic bonded magnets and carbon fiber reinforced retaining sleeves. This paper examines by numerical studies the consequences for the losses of using these materials. The effect of laminating the magnets and the losses in the anisotropic sleeve are analysed with 3D simulations, using simplifications determined with 2D simulations. The anisotropic resistivity of the sleeve roughly doubles the losses compared to an isotropic sleeve, while laminating the magnets in n slices reduces the losses by 1/n1.8.",

Echoic flow can be computed in a number of forms, the simplest being the ratio of range, to range rate. This provides a direct measure of the time for a radar system and a detected object to collide with each other. Its derivative is a measure of the intensity of the collision. Thus these two quantities provide a powerful foundation for autonomous navigation, tracking and guidance. In this paper we explain echoic flow and show through simulation how it can be used as a basis for radar based autonomous navigation.",

The Virtual Speech Quality Objective Listener (ViSQOL) model is a signal based full reference metric that uses a spectro-temporal measure of similarity between a reference and a test speech signal. This paper describes the algorithm and compares the results with PESQ for common problems in VoIP: clock drift, associated time warping and jitter. The results indicate that ViSQOL is less prone to underestimation of speech quality in both scenarios than the ITU standard.",

Two voltage source inverters with a front end diode rectifier are directly paralleled without intermodule reactors. The proposed method divides the switching cycle evenly between the equally rated converters, and each converter employs just one PI regulator to get good current characteristics, both in steady states and transient states. Unlike in most previous studies, the converters utilize local feedback information to obtain equal current sharing without using any circulating current control scheme. Using MATLAB/Simulink, simulation results are given to verify the control proposed.",

        "abstract": "The possibility of localize moving targets by exploiting a passive radar system based on WiFi transmissions is investigated in this paper. Specifically, the exploitation of multiple passive sensors is considered which allows to collect a set of range/Doppler/angle measures for a given target when observed at different bistatic geometries. Different target localization strategies are investigated based on proper subsets of the available measures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the exploitation of the accuracy of the measures allows to improve the target localization performance. Experimental results are shown which have been obtained by means of a passive radar prototype developed and fielded at the DIET Dept. - University of Rome “La Sapienza”. This will contribute to demonstrate the fruitful application of the passive radar concept for short range surveillance.",

        "abstract": "With ever increased use of traditional vehicles, air pollution problems caused by exhaust system are getting more and more serious. Many countries are now actively seeking new resources or replacing energy. Electric vehicles using batteries power as the main driving force can effectively reduce the transport cost and environment pollution. In addition, charging batteries during off peak hours can increase the efficacy of power systems. In order to further reduce the charging impacts on the existing distribution system and the driving cost, this paper proposes an operation model of battery swap station for electric city buses. By analyzing the characteristics of the battery lease mode and electric city buses, an optimal solution is obtained to maximize the annual profit of battery swap station and minimize the charging impact.",

The cross-polarized HV component is created by both single bounce object (such as vegetation) and double bounce structures (such as oriented building blocks). It has been proposed to extend the volume scattering model suited for two physical scattering models. It is shown that vegetation area and oriented urban building area well discriminated compared to those resulting from implementation of the existing four-component scattering power decomposition.",

It is assumed that the system adopts uniform power allocation. We derive closed-form expressions for the end-to-end capacity with different average signal-to-noise-ratio(SNR) in the loop interference channel. In particular, we evaluate the loop interference threshold value, below which the full-duplex mode demonstrates better performance than the half-duplex mode. The simulation results indicate that the full-duplex mode outperforms the half-duplex mode in terms of capacity if the SNR in the loop interference channel within a range of interest. Therefore, the spectral efficiency is improved as well as the link performance in the wireless system.",

The environmental and mechanical factors strongly influence mentioned parameters. Thus numerous coating systems consisting of pure metallic materials, noble and non noble, doped as well as soft coatings were developed and studied. In this work the degradation mechanisms of homogeneous bronze/nickel/silver coatings systems were studied under fretting loadings. Five silver layer thicknesses (1.3μm, 2μm, 3μm, 4μm and 5μm) were investigated. Different test procedures have been applied to identify first the transition from partial to gross slip conditions and establish the electrical endurances as a function of the applied displacement amplitudes in the finite endurance gross slip condition. Very basic criteria have been introduced to rationalize and compare the electrical endurance as a function of the coating thickness. It is shown that the evolution of the electrical endurance vs. the coating thickness displays a nearly linear increase above a threshold coating thickness. Below this threshold, silver was found to delaminate from nickel interlayer in the very earlier stage of the test inducing very short electrical endurance.",

The assumed condition of three circles intersecting to form an overlapping area in triangle and centroid localization algorithm cannot be met in practical situations. In this paper, we propose the triangle and centroid localization algorithm based on distance compensation because of the impracticability of triangle and centroid localization algorithm. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is workable for localization.",

Many localization algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, localization in threedimensional (3D) space has not been studied sufficiently. Also, artificial neural networks are not commonly used in localization. In this paper, we present a 3D localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks using artificial neural networks. In the proposed scheme, the idea of the 2D localization using neural network is extended to achieve a 3D localization with simplicity, location accuracy, mobility, and low cost. The simulation results depict the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Soft switching for power factor collection (PFC) of high-end server power supply unit (PSU) is studied. FET loss of PFC circuit is caused by Ron-related loss and switching loss. The switching loss consists of switching-speed-related part and output capacitance (Coss)-related part. The switching-speed related-part can be reduced by using a high-speed FET and high-power gate driver; however, Coss-related loss remains constant and makes efficiency worse especially in low-load region. We propose a new soft switching PFC circuit designed for Coss-related loss reduction and demonstrated that the PFC loss was reduced by half at 20% load with both SPICE simulation and prototype circuit. In the data server case, the average load of the PSU is usually less than 30% [1] when redundant PSU is used, so this circuit is very effective for energy saving of data center.",

In this model, both single and double-bounce multipath components are taken into account. Then the corresponding deterministic simulation model is derived from the reference model. By using the Riemann sum method (RSM) and the exact relationship between the angle-of-departure (AOD) and the angle-of-arrival (AOA), the parameters of the simulation model are determined. Furthermore, the correlation properties of simulation model are analyzed, including the space-time-frequency cross-correlation function (STF-CCF), the 2D space cross-correlation function (CCF), the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF) and the frequency autocorrelation function (FCF). The results illustrate the excellent correspondence between the space and time domain properties of the simulation model and those of the reference model.",

Especially driving in complex environments containing both streets and unstructured regions is a challenging problem. In this paper we present the application of the Hybrid A* algorithm to a nonholonomic mobile outdoor robot in order to plan near optimal paths in mostly unknown and potentially intricate environments. The implemented algorithm is capable of generating paths with a rate of at least 10 Hz to guarantee real-time behavior.",

Wind farms need to participate in power system restoration after blackouts. Several aspects of power system restoration considering wind farms are presented in this paper, including the development of wind power technology, the target and constraints of wind farm restoration and the influence on load restoration. The output power of wind farms and the opportune moment to restore wind farms are the key factors to decide whether wind farms should be restored.",

The multipath channel is modelled with geometrical features such as flat planes and point reflectors, whose locations are uncertain. The practical issue of data association between radar returns and multipath modes in the presence of missed detections and false alarms is solved via a multi-hypothesis data association algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate enhanced target tracking performance in the presence of multipath even when the direct path is occasionally unobservable.",

        "abstract": "In this paper techno-economical evaluation of constructing an electric vehicles parking lot by a distribution company is discussed. Electric Vehicles (EVs) have been the centre of attention in recent years because they can be used to form a bidirectional connection to the power grid. In this scheme an aggregation of electric vehicles can be used to provide ancillary services for a power grid which is known as Vehicle to Grid (V2G) concept. Aggregation of EVs in a parking lot can be considered as a distributed generation (DG) unit. During off-peak hours, power grid provides electrical energy for charging the EVs in a parking lot while during peak hours some part of their stored energy should be given back to the grid. In this paper, it is considered that the parking lot belongs to a distribution company. Such parking lots is considered as a distributed generation (DG) unit which may offer some advantages like emission reduction, power quality improvement, reliability enhancement and deferral in distribution upgrades.",

The Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is a most complex power electronic device, which can simultaneously control a local bus voltage and optimization power flows in electrical power transmission system. This paper presents real and reactive power flow control through a 400 kV transmission line by connected the UPFC at the sending and receiving end. The objective are to determine control and performance of UPFC who is intended for installation on that transmission line to control active and reactive power flow. When no UPFC is installed, active and reactive power through the transmission line can not be controlled. Simulations are carried out in Matlab/Simulink environment to evaluate the performance of the UPFC.",

Almost all residential customers are subjected to variations in the system voltage and frequency. Also, the source impedance is different for different customers depending on their distance from the utility transformers and distribution cabinets and the system loading. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of the voltage amplitude, source impedance and system frequency on the harmonics produced by a single PC for variations within practical limits. Experimental measurements and computer simulations are performed to confirm the observations.",

In order to increase the acceptable grid-connected capacity for wind power, the output fluctuation is requested to be limited by improving forecast precision or using energy storage. This paper is focused on sizing battery energy storage system (BESS) for wind farm applications, so as to keep the differences between the combined wind/BESS output and the predefined profile within a required limit. Mathematical model for seeking the optimal size is developed based on chance-constrained programming. Genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem, and Monte-Carlo method is applied to deal with the chance-constrained question.",

Particularly attractive is the interior PM (IPM) machine that is characterized by a rotor anisotropy. Thanks to this feature, the IPM rotor position can be detected with out sensor also at zero speed, by means of techniques based on high-frequency signal injection. The aim of this paper is to investigate, using both finite element simulations and experimental tests, the sensorless position detection capability of an IPM dual three-phase machine equipped with two fractional-slot windings. These two windings are designed to be supplied by two separate converters, yielding an increase of the fault-tolerant capability of the machine.",

In premise of the current carrying performance conditions, there will be erosion resistance wear when the load is smaller, but mechanism wear when the load is bigger. In this article, many experiments through the leaching copper carbon sliding plate and Silver copper wire were conducted to study the wear characteristics of the sliding electrical contact in different load flow, speed and the changes of load. And some variables are fixed, then the others will be changed to find the variety of wear, also the data have been saved. After analyzing the relationship of different conditions, a model including the wear and the contact load will be produced, then draw the function equation include speed and others variables. The coefficient of which will be devised based on the saved data using the least-square method. And some experimentations are taken to validate the model, which could adequately reflect the function relationship between the wear and contact load. Also this model will be given a theory basis on the best load designing.",

This paper presents protection schemes for out of step detection based on synchronized phasor measurement. Voltages and currents at both the ends of a transmission line are used to derive the parameters required for designing these schemes. The proposed schemes can distinguish stable and unstable power swing and can prohibit tripping of distance relays on stable power swings. The schemes are also compared with conventional power swing detection schemes. Simulations are carried out on single machine infinite bus system (SMIB) using PSCAD.",

A mode solver technique is proposed to handle LLC converter steady-state solutions under different input voltage conditions. Loss models are provided to calculate total component losses using the current and voltage information derived from the mode solver. A prototype 300W 12V output LLC converter is built using the optimization results. Experimental results are presented.",

Critically the plant machines cannot be taken off-line for testing due to the cost implications. So a method of evaluating efficiency solutions avoiding this, must be devised.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a microgrid emergency control strategy-the stratified controllable load shedding optimization. Firstly the method stratifies controllable load into different levels based on the degree of load importance and load frequency regulation effect coefficient (KL). Then the optimization model is put forward. It is difficult to deal with since it is a nonlinear mixed integer programming problem. This paper proposes a new step-by-step solution and its principle is described in detail. The feasibility of the method is verified by carrying out with Matlab. The modified IEEE 9-bus distribution system is used to simulate a microgrid. The emergency controllable load stratification is put forward, and the results are listed. By comparing with the traditional method of load shedding and analysing the results, we can conclude that the proposed method is reasonable and effective.",

        "abstract": "Effective utilization of electricity is one of global objectives for realization of sustainable societies. In order to utilize electricity supply systems efficiently, it is necessary to level our electricity demand by shifting peak time electricity demand to non-peak time. Demand response (DR) is expected as the key technology to level electricity demand by demand peak cut or shift, and it is necessary to expand the amount of the peak cut and shift capacity. In the US and some regions, various demand response programs have been implemented and the amount of peak load reduction has increased in the US. However, most of demand reduction resources are from “Commercial and Industrial” and “Wholesale” sectors and expansion of DR program utilization in residential sector is one of the important challenges to increase effectiveness of demand response programs. This paper reorganizes current existing demand response programs systematically and clarifies their characters. And using the result, an evaluation approach of demand response programs are proposed by focusing on the benefit of these programs for expansion of peak load reduction amount in residential side.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic spectrum access technologies such as cognitive radio aim to improve the current spectrum utilisation by allowing opportunistic spectrum access to the licensed frequency bands without causing interference. However, in order to this, better understanding of the spectrum usage pattern is important. In this context, this paper presents the 24-hour spectrum survey of an outdoor radio environment in a suburban area in Johor Bahru, Malaysia in the frequency bands from 30-3000 MHz. The objectives are to investigate how the different services being allocated are utilised and identify bands that have low or no active utilisation. The result of the spectrum measurement reveals that the utilisation is 11.29% with a significant amount of spectrum underutilized is at frequencies above 1 GHz. The outcome of the study suggests that cognitive radio could indeed improve the spectrum utilisation and become the platform to provide for future wireless services. However, these studies are preliminary and future long term spectrum survey is required in better understanding and modelling of the actual spectrum usage pattern for cognitive radio applications.",
