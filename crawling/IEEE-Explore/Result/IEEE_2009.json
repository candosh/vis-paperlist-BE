        "abstract": "Summary form only given. Human intelligence is based on the functions of language. From this fact it is very natural to characterize an intelligent system by language: capability of handling language or capability of working with language. Discussing some issues of language related to intelligence, we focus on language functions of the brain in this talk. There are three approaches to elucidate the language functions of the brain: top-down, intermediate, and bottom-up. In this talk, we shall first see some examples of top-down and intermediate approaches, and then discuss a bottom-up approach. As a top-down approach we show computational models of language in which four principles are realized, and as an intermediate approach, we introduce the stratification in the brain shown by aphasia studies. As a bottom-up approach, we have conducted brain experiments, aiming to elucidate the difference of brain activities during processing ideational meaning and interpersonal meaning. In the experiments, two kinds of sentences with and without honorific expressions were sequentially shown to subjects, where texts with honorific expressions contain interpersonal meaning and texts without honorific expressions mainly hold ideational meaning. Electroencephalograms were measured to acquire event-related potentials. Then using equivalent current dipole source localization method, we analyzed the neuronal activation of the brain. It was found that the brain activities for understanding sentences with honorific expressions are different from those produced for understanding sentences without honorific expressions. Finally we shall discuss a brain mechanism possibly used for learning how to speak."

Cost and difficulty of super integration, lack of flexibility, little resource sharing combined with a new class of issues attached to deep submicron process variability, reliability, open opportunities to revisit more regular, programmable approaches as an alternative. Will our industry see the emergence of a new generation of standard mega cells that can be assembled as homogeneous many cores fabrics as an alternative to today's heterogeneous SoCs? We strongly believe that the answer is yes and in this talk we will go through the many folds of this question."

We make extensive use of structural information extracted from the input formula such as functional definitions of variables and non-linear quantifier structures. We show how this information can directly be exploited by the symbolic, AIG based representation. We implemented a prototype QBF solver based on our ideas and performed a number of experiments proving the effectiveness of our approach, and moreover, showing that our method is able to solve QBF instances on which state-of-the-art QBF solvers known from literature fail."

The fuzzy membership functions of system component outage parameters are developed using statistical records whereas the system load is modeled using a combined fuzzy and probabilistic representation. Based on the fuzzy-probabilistic models, a hybrid method of fuzzy set and Monte Carlo simulation for power system risk assessment is proposed to capture both randomness and fuzziness of loads and component outage parameters. An actual example using a regional system at BCTC is given to demonstrate the application of the presented fuzzy-probabilistic models for system parameters and new system risk evaluation method."

Although now the share of LV-connected units is quite limited, this situation might change with the increase of number of installed micro CHP units in residential areas, further stimulus of solar power production and introduction of electric and fuel cell based cars. Management and control of such small and medium-scale inverter-interfaced generation can be optimised using the virtual power plant (VPP) principle. Various control aspects of VPP as an attribute of the interconnected power system are analyzed, and the design of a small-scale experimental setup is proposed."

Whilst some of the advantages of HFAC systems have been widely discussed in literature, there appears no systematic and quantitative study on the evaluation of these benefits. This paper proposes a systematic framework to facilitate quantitative evaluation of key performance parameters of the HFAC system. A set of eleven performance parameters, including power factor and line regulation, will be used in formulating the system performance index. By allowing a weighting factor to each parameter to reflect its relative importance in a specific application, a robust and realistic assessment of the system performance can be established."

However, when considering distribution networks, reactive power may not be an effective mean for voltage control. This is because of the X/R ratio which determines the controllability of voltage through active and/or reactive power. Therefore, in this paper a voltage control scheme is proposed based on the estimation of the X/R ratio of the grid. The estimated X/R will then be used to determine the active and reactive power to be injected into the grid in order to keep the voltage between permissible limits."

Due to the low-level analog output of typical sensors, designing interface electronics that ldquodoes no harmrdquo, i.e. does not impair sensor performance, is quite challenging, especially in today's mainstream CMOS technology, whose inherent precision is limited by 1/f noise and component mismatch. However, since most sensors are quite slow compared to transistors, dynamic techniques can often be used to trade speed or bandwidth for higher precision. Examples of such techniques are auto zeroing, chopping, dynamic element matching, switched-capacitor filtering and sigma-delta modulation. This paper describes the use of such dynamic techniques in the design and realization of state-of-the-art smart CMOS temperature sensors."

In this paper, we propose a NoC link arbitration technique that supports bandwidth guarantees along with best effort latency optimizations. In contrast to many existing quality of service mechanisms, our technique prioritizes best effort over guaranteed bandwidth traffic for optimal latency. Distributed traffic shaping is used to offer bandwidth guarantees over previously reserved connections, which are established dynamically using control messages. Initial simulation results show that our arbitration scheme can provide tight bandwidth guarantees for streaming traffic under network overload conditions. At the same time, the average latency of best effort traffic is improved compared to a simple prioritization of streaming traffic."

The approach has been verified on a large set of multi-threaded benchmarks. Results show that our methodology (a) enables accurate realtime and responsiveness analysis of parallel applications running on MPSOCs, (b) allows the designer to devise an optimal interrupt distribution mechanism for the given application, and (c) helps dimensioning the system to meet performance and real-time needs."

This has highlighted the vulnerability of the Internet to denial-of-service attacks. While the TPC/IP protocol stack was never intended to provide guaranteed quality of service, many of the vulnerabilities are simple accidents and make it unnecessarily easy for DoS attackers to reach their goals. In this talk, I suggest that DoS-resistance is becoming a key requirement for all network protocols and draw examples mostly from the design of mobility protocols."

In this paper, we formulate the problem of finding an optimal generation dispatch and transmission topology to meet a specific inflexible load as a mixed integer program. Our model is a mixed-integer linear program because it employs binary variables to represent the state of the equipment and linear relationships to describe the physical system. We find that on the standard 118-bus IEEE test case a savings of 25 percent in system dispatch cost can be achieved."

We assess the current IT in education and e-learning support systems and technologies, and discuss the potentialities of e-learning to serve as a driving force for reformation and innovation in higher education. We further describe our concept of growing campus toward universal provision of an amenity learning environment and educational service that best fits everyone's need and learning style, and the framework of u3-campus (ubiquitous, universal and unlimited campus) with an ultimate goal of unlimited learning. We emphasize the importance of paradigm shift from technology-driven to human-centric in pursuit of wellbeing in education. Finally, we envision the future IT in education, and address some key issues and challenges."

In this talk, we analyze traffic data collected from three deployed networks: a cellular wireless network used by public safety agancies, a satellite network used by Internet service providers, and the Internet. We describe analysis of network log data collected from E-Comm, a public safety trunked radio network that utilizes circuit-switched cellular wireless technology. We examine statistical distributions and autocorrelation functions of call inter-arrival and call holding times during busy hours. Our findings indicate that traditional Er land models used for voice traffic may not be suitable for evaluating the performance of trunked radio networks. We also describe collection of traffic data, characterization of traffic loads, and distribution of packet sizes in ChinaSat, a hybrid satellite-terrestrial system. We investigate long-range dependence as the traffic patterns very, propose a traffic model for the transmission control protocol (TCP) connections, and use data from billing records to predict future traffic loads. Since discovering network topology is important for analyzing routing protocols and network robustness and resilience, we also examine datasets from the route views and RIPE projects and identify important properties of Internet graphs. Our current traffic measurement project deals with traffic collection from BC. Net, the Vancouver lower mainland gigabit Ethernet network. Collected data will be used to analyze behavior and performance of the border gateway protocol (BGP)."

Rectangular slabs of the material were tested on the inclined plane test (ASTM D2303)for determining the tracking and erosion resistance. Some slabs were sand-blasted to duplicate the degradation observed on field-aged samples that were located in various test sites for up to 20 years. Leakage current data was recorded for new and sandblasted samples during the test. The model is a product of leakage current and arc time at a particular spot as a parameter for the Weibull distribution. The model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results."

With so many transistors in a single chip, many dream applications become possible. Designers are eager to use those tremendous capacity of the integration circuits to bring more intelligent, more smart functions. One of the challenge target is can we design the circuits to make the SOC perform tasks that humans do quickly and easily? Can we make the computer to recognize images, understand language, learn knowledge, and control robots? In this presentation, the concept of Bio-inspiring computing which takes the advantages of neural science will be described. Some previous studies tried to explain the behavior of the human neocortex and provide a framework for building models that could be implemented and executed with Tera-scale SOC. Research suggested that the structure of the neocortex is hierarchical, and that the emulation of 6 levels of hierarchy is sufficient to achieve sophisticated recognition and analysis of visual images. Some experimental results will be presented to demo the possibility. It could be the dawn of the age of intelligence machines and neocortical computing. There will be many opportunities that Tera-scale SOC could create."

Silicon IC technology scaling delivers the required transistor densities to meet the computational needs of multimedia systems, however, at an ever increasing cost. Changes in the technology landscape influence multimedia systems architectures, resulting in design challenges and opportunities. In this presentation we provide a glimpse of this technology-design interaction in the context of multimedia systems, touching upon multi-core architectures, 3D chip-stacking, and embedded MEMS technology."

The mechanism of how these simple systems maximize highly specific signal array and minimize irrelevant crosstalks has not been well characterized. In particular, the underlying biochemical mechanism of functional HK-RR pairs is yet to be understood since HK and RR genes share high level of sequence similarity. In this paper, we show, using an information- and graph-theoretic approach, that there are non-conserved, but highly co-evolving amino acid residue pairs in functional HK-RR pairs, but not in potentially non-functional HK-RR pairs. This finding can potentially help us to understand how HK and RR pairs and can lead us to develop a computational method to predict the functional HK-RR pairs and a guidance system for the mutation experiment design for a TCS."

To predict a tendon slack length, exact muscle parameters are needed. But it is difficult to measure all of the muscle parameters from human body. So we propose the algorithm which finds the tendon slack length of hamstring for more accurate estimation of knee flexor moment. Algorithm was embodied by MATLAB optimization tool box. And it is evaluated by using an experiment data."

This panel session will be an opportunity to share some of the recent advances in terms of standards, processes, and understanding of how to effectively utilize the information model. Tooling advances have been considerable in the course of the last year, with the emergence of several open source or free tools made available from both universities and commercial businesses. The CIM source model is now available in a much more accessible UML tool. Commercial interests, recent projects, tooling, and standards advances appear to be at a tipping point in terms of widespread usage of the CIM model and related standards."

Since the performance evaluation of airport operation must take various criteria into consideration and most of the criteria are measured on imprecise, subjectivity and vagueness, the evaluation problem will be a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making(FMCDM)problem. Based on the concept, we apply a FMCDM method to solve the performance evaluation problem. In the FMCDM method, approximate degrees of alternatives over positive extreme solution are derived to be performance indices. We rank the evaluation alternatives according to the indices and then the best one is found."

Possibilities of use of an existing information technologie, developed for the purposes of the Electronic Government, for Service State creation are analysed. The transition model for creation of the Service State by initiation of the Institute of designing of the state services is offered. Necessity of social institute for using activity of social architects and designers is revealed. As for the expected result — to reach decrease in dependence of quality of the government from political manipulations that will make conditions for consecutive perfection of the state services and intellectualization of control systems of the Service state."

The improved performance and decreased cost of imaging technology has enabled the wide deployment of 2D barcodes for many applications across many vertical industries. Imaging-based barcode scanner products are now the most rapidly growing segment of the industry. Following a brief introduction to 2D barcodes and their applications, the imaging technology requirements unique to barcode scanning are presented. The camera designs are broken down into their significant components, such as the lens system, image sensor electronics, flash illumination and target aiming. The camera design is contrasted with the design of a common mobile phone camera."

The most current development under way in the TV and cinema arena is the progression towards 3-dimensional capture and consumption of video. This will provide a major change in how consumers will experience visual media and at the same time require major technological developments. The purpose of the tutorial is to provide an overview on the current trends and perspectives in 3D television and cinema."

        "abstract": "Nanometre scale planar magnetic nanowires can exhibit a special magnetic property known as domain wall (DW) conduit behaviour in which DWs can be transmitted along the nanowire by the application of weak magnetic fields or electrical currents. Topographical changes such as corners, junctions, constrictions and protrusions in otherwise straight magnetic nanowires allow control of the DWs within these conduits as they create changes in the energy landscape which modify their local propagation field. This opens up the possibility of integrated circuits containing complex networks of nanowires in which information is carried, stored and processed by DWs flowing along nanowire conduits. In this talk I describe the main features of how artificial structures such as constrictions, side arms and crossed wires modify the energy landscape of a moving DW and explain the key role that the chirality of the transverse component of the DW plays in understanding how DWs interact with artificial structures. I explain the concept of a chirality coherence length and how that coherence length can be extended by artificial structuring. I demonstrate the effect of magnetostatic crosstalk between domain walls in neighbouring wires (an essential consideration in any high density device). Finally, I present a high efficiency domain wall gate in which a DW can be blocked or transmitted according to the magnetic state of a third magnetic input."

Yet, reusing learning objects is feasible with advanced computer and network technologies. In addition to use a common representation of learning objects (e.g., SCORM, QTI, Common Cartridge), infrastructure and repository framework to store these objects are critical, not only to guarantee storage efficiency but to encourage material exchange. How to effectively search and find learning objects in the repository framework thus play an important role. This presentation addresses a few research issues, with partial solutions for repository construction with guided search. The talk will start from an introduction of a few de facto distance learning standards, with demonstration of related systems developed by the presenter. The discussion then continues with a repository framework called CORDRA, with newly proposed technologies for learning object retrieval. Interested readers are welcome to look at software demonstrations at http://www.mine.tku.edu.tw."

The increasing demands on embedded non-volatile memories in logic circuits spurred many research activities in the development of low-cost, highly scalable and compatible solutions. Besides full compatibility to standard CMOS logic process, low voltage and power operations, small cell size, and fast programming and accessing speed are all desirable features in logic NVMs. As technology scales, conventional solutions suffer from high power, performance degradation and poor scalability. In this talk, new logic NVM cells developed for advance logic circuit are introduced and compared to provide new design directions for the future."

The compounding of these two trends has set the stage for optical networking technology to make significant contributions in next-generation data network architecture. In this talk, we will explore key research problems of optical network architecture with emphasis on optical flow switching that, if properly exploited, will enable significant growth and cost-effective scalability of next-generation data networks."
