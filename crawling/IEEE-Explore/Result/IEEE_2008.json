        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for the multi-oriented text line extraction from handwritten Arabic documents. After image pre-processing, the local orientations are determined in small windows obtained by image paving. The orientation of the text within each window is estimated using the projection profile technique considering several projection angles. Then, the windows which close angles are gathered into largest zones. We use the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) to estimate the global orientation of each zone. The WVD is more precise than the classical projection profile technique. Afterwards, the text lines are extracted in each zone basing on the follow-up of the baselines and the proximity of connected components. The experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme. It has been evaluated on 50 documents reaching an accuracy of about 97.6%."

However, only a few studies were reported on this new research topic in the literature. In this paper, the main target of handwriting evaluation has been presented. The common layout errors in handwriting samples are summarized and then a new layout evaluation method is proposed. The method is consisted of three parts of stroke layout evaluation, component layout evaluation and entire character shape evaluation, through the application of nine assessment rules. The experiment results show that the method is capable for detecting layout errors of handwriting samples and making objective assessment on whether a character is written good or not."

The method evolved out of social psychological simulations of social influence processes featuring a positivity bias in self-presentation and a proclivity for mimicry, with some random noise added. In this talk I will introduce the algorithm, show its connections to social behaviours in humans and other species, and discuss effects of variations in rules and parameters. I will tend to emphasise research that simplifies the algorithm rather than making it harder, as researchers come to understand what is essential for intelligence to emerge in a population of simple interacting entities."

The present work analyzes a particular mathematical domain more deeply. We have chosen to examine second year university engineering mathematics as taught in North America as the domain. We have analyzed the set of expressions occurring in the most popular textbooks, weighted by popularity. Assuming that early training influences later mathematical usage, we take this as a model of the set of mathematical expressions used by the population of North American engineers.  We present an empirical analysis of the symbols and $n$-grams occurring in these expressions."

Using characteristics of structurally similar TrueType fonts, our system automatically builds a model to be used for the segmentation and recognition of the new script, independent of glyph composition. The key is a reliance on known font attributes. In our system three feature extraction methods are used to demonstrate the importance of appropriate features for classification. The methods are tested on both Latin (English) and non-Latin (Khmer) scripts. Results show that the character-level recognition accuracy exceeds 92\\% for Khmer and 96\\% for English on degraded documents. This work is a step toward the recognition of scripts of low-density languages which typically do not warrant the development of commercial OCR, yet often have complete TrueType font descriptions."

Initially, strokes are grouped into text line strings according to off-stroke distances. Each text line string is segmented into text lines by dynamic programming (DP) optimizing a cost function trained by the minimum classification error (MCE) method. Over-segmented text lines are then merged with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for making merge/non-merge decisions, and last, a spatial merge module corrects the segmentation errors caused by delayed strokes. In experiments on the TUAT Kondate database, the proposed approach achieves the Entity Detection Metric (EDM) rate of 0.8816, the Edit-Distance Rate (EDR) of 0.1234, which demonstrates the superiority of our approach."

The instances to be learned (i.e., stored) are rotation invariants and a  rotation variant for each character category. Using the instances, it is possible to estimate a skew angle of each individual character on a document. This fact implies that the proposed method can estimate the skew angle of a document where characters do not form long straight text lines. Thus, the proposed method will be applicable to various  documents such as signboard images captured by a camera. Experimental  evaluation using synthetic and real images revealed the expected  robustness against various character layouts."

However, these fixed schemes and techniques are not the most suitable solutions in mobile scenarios, where the behaviour of the channel and the users are continuously changing during the day-time. This paper presents a new approach to the frequency assignment problem adapted to OFDMA networks, called Dynamic Frequency Planning, which in turn may decrease the interference and increase the capacity of the network by around 20%. DFP operates in a regular basis, adapting the network configuration to the time-dependent channel conditions and user requirements. On the other hand, DFP uses novel algorithms to estimate the inputs of the frequency assignment problem and tailored versions of meta-heuristic such as Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search, or Greedy Algorithms to solve it. Further discussion about the trade off between the quality of the solution and computing time when using meta-heuristic or greedy algorithm is provided. This paper also indicates, when running DFP, how to check the improvements in the network performance. Experimental evaluations carried out using system level simulations show the boost in the capacity when using DFP."

However, word extraction often fails because of layout analysis or character recognition error, which leads correct character hypotheses not to be generated. We propose a word extraction method which generates multiple character hypotheses and extracts their combinations which correspond with the character orders of words. Firstly character hypotheses which overlap with each other are generated by combinatorial recognition of connected components and their combinations which correspond with words are extracted by clique extraction from a graph. And then, character hypotheses are generated by recognition with limited target and their combinations which correspond with words areextracted by matching between lattices based on local optimum, in which variety of recognition results and regular expression of words are considered. We confirmed the effect of our method by the experiment for form images."

The dynamic equations for the errors are proposed and the observability of the 15 error states (velocity errors, position errors, bias errors of the inertial instruments) of the system is analyzed. The convergence rate of the states is also discussed. It is analyzed that the estimated accuracy of the bias errors are influenced by the initial attitude errors. In order to estimate the bias errors, the system should be set on at least three different positions. The analysis results are tested by simulations."

The demand for ever increasing performance, lower latency, and more complex calculations coupled with increasing volumes drives a continuous effort in the industry to leverage emerging technology. This challenge has been brought to the forefront in the past few years by an additional set of factors. Some of these include availability of data center space, energy costs, the multicore revolution, and the economy. The result has been a dramatic increase in software and hardware products available for calculations that were traditionally limited to only a few options. Navigating this vast set of choices and selecting the optimal solutions for specific systems and calculations is the new challenge for financial services."

Thus, there are three different local characteristics as homogeneous, directed and complex on text image. Homogeneous region corresponds to background and directed means the region with dominant stroke direction and remaining is complex region. We proposed higher order smoothing on homogeneous region and anisotropic regularization on directed region which encodes the preference of edge direction by smoothing along preferred direction only. Required regularization terms are combined in proposed anisotropic TV functional and controlled by relating parameters. We calculated relating parameters byutilizing structure tensor field. Also to reduce the computational cost, we previously estimated nonchanging pixels and exclude them from calculation for speed up. Experiments shown that, proposed method performs better with low computational cost than general purpose TV on text image."

Current handwriting recognition systems are only capable of recognizing words that are present in a restricted lexicon typically comprised of 10 to 1000 words. As the size of the lexicon grows, the recognition accuracy falls sharply and is reported to be around 30% for a10K word lexicon.  The objective of this research is to raise the accuracy levels on unconstrained handwritten documents by reducing the size of lexicons. We present an innovative method of lexicon reduction by topic categorization of handwritten documents. After categorization of a document into a topic e.g. sports, science etc. we use smaller lexicons that include only words with high mutual information with that topic and hence increase performance of recognizers. In this paper we present different techniques and report results on a publicly available dataset."

Most characters on scene images appear with the same color and font size at every word or text line. In our algorithm, a scene image is divided into several blocks based on edges in the color space at first. Then the blobs, which consist of similar color pixels, are extracted by a clustering in a color space for each block. Although these blobs are correspond to characters or background patterns, after connecting them using these aspect ratios and pitches, SVM (Support Vector Machine) on several textural features of these blobs will classify each connected blob into character or background patterns. Testing with 251 images from ICDAR 2003 Text Locating Competition shows effectiveness of our algorithm."

The fuzzy logic system is used to approximate the uncertainties of the controlled systems, then the decentralized adaptive robust controller and adaptive laws of parameter estimate of fuzzy logic system are constructed, which can ensure the outputs of the controlled systems asymptotically track the reference signals, meanwhile the states of systems controlled and parameter estimate errors are bounded. The approximation exactnesses of the fuzzy logic system and estimate errors are analyzed in mathematically. Finally the computer simulation shows the validity of the method."

Based on the information fusion optimal estimation theorem, by fusing the one-step predictive information of the largescale system state and the sub-system measurement information, the optimal estimation of the largescale system state is derived. Moreover, by fusing the state estimation information, the co-state estimation information and the soft constrained control energy information, the optimal estimation of the control station output is obtained."

Starting from the subpixel edge location, a improved algorithm for obtaining the subpixel edge, in this paper, is first brought forward based on the geometrical feature of the center and gray-distributed characteristic of the practical image. Then, the center location is realized by the least square method. Several experiments are used to compare this new algorithm and currently existing algorithms, and through the results, it can be concluded that the improved algorithm has much higher location precision and better robustness."

The method of single comparing is used to find thermal resistance value with high accuracy; then the value is mapped to the corresponding temperature by looking into reference table. Therefore, linearity is implemented, which greatly reduces the impact of temperature-drift and non-linearity in amplifier. In addition, the device implements the measuring of full temperature range of the reference table. The test error is ±6°C in −200°C ∼850°C with B class platinum thermal resistor."

The proposed algorithm uses the voltage equation for the faulted phase of the faulted line. The equation contains the fault distance, fault resistance, and fault current. To obtain the fault current, Kirchhoffpsilas voltage law is applied on the loops of three phases consisting of the faulted line and the adjacent parallel line. The fault current can be represented in terms of the fault distance. Inserting the fault current into the voltage equation results in an equation that contains only two parameters, i.e., the fault distance and fault resistance. The fault distance is estimated by solving the equation. Test results indicated that the algorithm accurately estimates the fault distance regardless of the fault resistance and mutual coupling effects."

The method is based on using a ANN(artificial neural netwok) to intelligently aid the GPS/INS integrated navigation system in the absence of GPS signal. The ANN is trained in every filter period during the GPS signal on; When the GPS is off, The output of the previously trained ANN is as the input of the same Kalman filter.The proposed enhanced GPS/INS can be used in the high dynamic environment of a autonomous carrier.

Transversal localization of the beam near the central ray allows one to separate and sequentially derive the refractional, focusing (or defocusing) and aberrational terms. The correct relationship between the scalar beam amplitude and the vector electric field is conserved for every order. For simplicity, a cold collisionless magnetized plasma is considered. However, all basic results are valid, with minor amendments, for media with spatial dispersion. The aberration-free parabolic-like equation for a complex beam envelope is considered in detail. Its physical properties are investigated and a general solution is found."

First, the freeway traffic flow dynamic model is built. Then the algorithmof the composition controller of CMAC and PID is formulated. In conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, the on-ramp metering rate of a freeway is determined by using the composition controller. Finally, the control system is simulated in MATLAB software and fuzzy logic controller is also chosen in contrast to the composition controller. The result shows that the composition controller improves evidently on the aspects of response speed and dynamic performance. It can achieve a desired traffic density along the mainline of a freeway, and can make vehicles travel more efficiently and safely. This method provides a novel and practical way to realize freeway on-ramp metering."

The conventional method of calculating the phasors is using a Fourier Transform, which introduces a delay of at least one fundamental cycle. This paper examines the feasibility of exploiting an alternative using a DQ transformation to calculate the phasors by extracting the fundamental component from a three-phase voltage or current in the DQ reference frame, which may be distorted by unbalanced components and harmonics. The proposed method allows obtaining a clean fundamental component of three-phase quantity with a minor delay less than one third of a fundamental cycle."

First collect two images and select a template in the first of two images, then by searching the template in the second image get the position of the template in the two images. Finally, by coordinate transformation get the displacement, then according to the time between two images we can calculate velocity. The experimental results illustrate that the efficiency and accuracy of the image algorithmare related to the image resolution, the choice of templates, matching area size and other factors. After a certain optimized the algorithmare can meet the demand of real-time data acquisition and processing."

They have strong ion-covalent bonding in separate layers and Van der Waals interaction between neighbouring layers. These semiconductors are considered as intermediate class of substances between 2D- and 3D- solids, between molecular and ion-covalent crystals. Therefore the new phenomena can be observed in physical properties of layered crystals with incorporated nanoparticles. The present report is devoted to manifestation and study of the following new physical effects in layered crystals intercalated by hydrazine molecukles: 1. V.I.Sugakovpsilas phenomenon in polariton emission; 2. Interlayer excitons and 3. Polytipic transitions under intercalation."

The images elucidate the mechanism of QD nucleation, demonstrating directly that not all deposited In is initially incorporated into the lattice, hence providing a large supply of material to rapidly form QDs via islands containing tens of atoms. kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations based on firstprinciples calculations show that tiny alloy fluctuations, like atomistic point defects, in the InGaAs wetting layer prior to are crucial in determining nucleation sites."
