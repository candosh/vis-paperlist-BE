Social networks are typical examples of multiple-category graphs: nodes are persons, links are friendships, and categories are communities that the persons belong to. It is often helpful to visualize both connectivity and categories of the graphs simultaneously. In this paper, we present a new visualization technique for multiple-category graphs. The technique firstly constructs hierarchical clusters of the nodes based on both connectivity and categories. It then places the nodes by a new hybrid space-filling and force-directed layout algorithm to clearly display both connectivity and category information. We show layout results using our hybrid method and compare it with other methods, and present a case study using an active biological network dataset."

        "abstract": "The end result of graph visualization is that people read the graph and understand the data. To make this effective, it is essential to construct visualizations based on how people read graphs. Despite the popularity and importance of graph usage in a variety of application domains, little is known about how people read graphs. The lack of this knowledge has severely limited the effectiveness of graph visualizations. In attempts to understand how people read graphs, we previously observed that people have geodesic-path tendency based on subjective eye tracking data. This paper presents two controlled experiments. One is to approve the existence of the geodesic-path tendency. The other is to examine the effects of this tendency on people in reading graphs. The results show that in performing path search tasks, when eyes encounter a node that has more than one link, links that go toward the target node are more likely to be searched first. The results also indicate that when graphs are drawn with branch links on the path leading away from the target node, graph reading performance can be significantly improved."

        "abstract": "Direct volume rendering is an important tool for visualizing complex data sets. However, in the process of generating 2D images from 3D data, information is lost in the form of attenuation and occlusion. The lack of a feedback mechanism to quantify the loss of information in the rendering process makes the design of good transfer functions a difficult and time consuming task. In this paper, we present the notion of visibility-driven transfer functions, which are transfer functions that provide a good visibility of features of interest from a given viewpoint. To achieve this, we introduce visibility histograms. These histograms provide graphical cues that intuitively inform the user about the contribution of particular scalar values to the final image. By carefully manipulating the parameters of the opacity transfer function, users can now maximize the visibility of the intervals of interest in a volume data set. Based on this observation, we also propose a semi-automated method for generating transfer functions, which progressively improves a transfer function defined by the user, according to a certain importance metric. Now the user does not have to deal with the tedious task of making small changes to the transfer function parameters, but now he/she can rely on the system to perform these searches automatically. Our methodology can be easily deployed in most visualization systems and can be used together with traditional 1D opacity transfer functions based on scalar values, as well as with multidimensional transfer functions and other more sophisticated rendering algorithms."

        "abstract": "The ability to extract and follow time-varying flow features in volume data generated from large-scale numerical simulations enables scientists to effectively see and validate modeled phenomena and processes. Extracted features often take much less storage space and computing resources to visualize. Most feature extraction and tracking methods first identify features of interest in each time step independently, then correspond these features in consecutive time steps of the data. Since these methods handle each time step separately, they do not use the coherency of the feature along the time dimension in the extraction process. In this paper, we present a prediction-correction method that uses a prediction step to make the best guess of the feature region in the subsequent time step, followed by growing and shrinking the border of the predicted region to coherently extract the actual feature of interest. This method makes use of the temporal-space coherency of the data to accelerate the extraction process while implicitly solving the tedious correspondence problem that previous methods focus on. Our method is low cost with very little storage overhead, and thus facilitates interactive or runtime extraction and visualization, unlike previous methods which were largely suited for batch-mode processing due to high computational cost."

Various temporal curves are utilized to organize the data and capture the temporal behaviors. To reveal patterns and find connections, we perform data clustering and segmentation using the k-means clustering and graph partitioning algorithms. We study the correlation structure of a single or a pair of variables using pointwise correlation coefficients and canonical correlation analysis.

        "abstract": "Although significant progress has been made toward effective insight discovery in visual sense making approaches, there is a lack of effective and efficient approaches to manage the large amounts of insights discovered. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage this problem around the concept of facts. Facts refer to patterns, relationships, or anomalies extracted from data under analysis. They are the direct products of visual exploration and permit construction of insights together with user's mental model and evaluation. Different from the mental model, the type of facts that can be discovered from data is predictable and application-independent. Thus it is possible to develop a general fact management framework (FMF) to allow visualization users to effectively and efficiently annotate, browse, retrieve, associate, and exchange facts. Since facts are essential components of insights, it will be feasible to extend FMF to effective insight management in a variety of visual analytics approaches. Toward this goal, we first construct a fact taxonomy that categorizes various facts in multidimensional data and captures their essential attributes through extensive literature survey and user studies. We then propose a conceptual framework of fact management based upon this fact taxonomy. A concrete scenario of visual sense making on real data sets illustrates how this FMF will work."

Showing the local structure of the reconstructed, angular probability profiles in a fast, detailed, and interactive way can improve the quality of the research in this area and help to move it into clinical application. In this paper we present a novel approach for HARDI glyph visualization or, more generally, for the visualization of any function that resides on a sphere and that can be expressed by a Laplace series. Our GPU-accelerated glyph rendering improves the performance of the traditional way of HARDI glyph visualization as well as the visual quality of the reconstructed data, thus offering interactive HARDI data exploration of the local structure of the white brain matter in-vivo. In this paper we exploit the capabilities of modern GPUs to overcome the large, processor-intensive and memory-consuming data visualization."

These approaches detect features globally in the data and place these features inside levels of a hierarchy. However, this feature detection is a global process and does not consider nodes of the graph near a feature of interest. TugGraph is a system for exploring paths and proximity around nodes and subgraphs in a graph. The approach modifies a pre-existing hierarchy in order to see how a node or subgraph of interest extends out into the larger graph. It is guaranteed to create path-preserving hierarchies, so that the abstraction shown is meaningful with respect to the structure of the graph. The system works well on graphs of hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of edges. TugGraph is able to present views of this proximal information in the context of the entire graph in seconds, and does not require a layout of the full graph as input."

In combination with the availability of ever larger COTS clusters and the consequently increasing number of simulated particles the resulting datasets pose a challenge for real-time visualization. Additionally the semantic density of the particles exceeds the possibilities of basic glyphs, like splats or spheres and results in dataset sizes larger by at least an order of magnitude. Interactive visualization on common workstations requires a careful optimization of the data management, especially of the transfer between CPU and GPU. We propose a flexible benchmarking tool along with a series of tests to allow the evaluation of the performance of different CPU/GPU combinations in relation to a particular implementation. We evaluate different uploading strategies and rendering methods for point-based compound glyphs suitable for representing the aforementioned datasets. CPU and GPU-based approaches are compared with respect to their rendering and storage efficiency to point out the optimal solution when dealing with time-dependent datasets. The results of our research are of general interest since they can be transferred to other applications where CPU-GPU bandwidth and a high number of graphical primitives per dataset pose a problem. The employed tool set for streamlining the measurement process is made publicly available."

        "abstract": "Current visualization systems are typically based on the concept of interactive post-processing. This decoupling of data visualization from the process of data generation offers a flexible application of visualization tools. It can also lead, however, to information loss in the visualization. Therefore, a combination of the visualization of the data generating process with the visualization of the produced data offers significant support for the understanding of the abstract data sets as well as the underlying process. Due to the application-specific characteristics of data generating processes, the task requires tailored visualization concepts. In this work, we focus on the application field of simulating biochemical reaction networks as discrete-event systems. These stochastic processes generate multi-run and multivariate time-series, which are analyzed and compared on three different process levels: model, experiment, and the level of multi-run simulation data, each associated with a broad range of analysis goals. To meet these challenging characteristics, we present visualization concepts specifically tailored to all three process levels. The fundament of all three visualization concepts is a compact view that relates the multi-run simulation data to the characteristics of the model structure and the experiment. The view provides the visualization at the experiment level. The visualization at the model level coordinates multiple instances of this view for the comparison of experiments. At the level of multi-run simulation data, the views gives an overview on the data, which can be analyzed in detail in time-series views suited for the analysis goals. Although we derive our visualization concepts for one concrete simulation process, our general concept of tailoring the visualization concepts to process levels is generally applicable for the visualization of simulation processes."

An appropriate contrast between symbols is a precondition that determines the efficiency of a visual analysis process. We study the contrast between different types of symbols in the context of scatterplots, based on user testing and a quantitative model for symbol contrast. In total, 32 different symbols were generated by using four sizes, two classes (polygon-and asterisk shaped), and four categories of rotational symmetry; and used three different tasks. From the user test results an internal separation space is established for the symbol types under study. In this space, every symbol is represented by a point, and the visual contrasts defined by task performance between the symbols are represented by the distances between the points. The positions of the points in the space, obtained by multidimensional scaling (MDS), reveal the effects of different visual feature scales. Also, larger distances imply better symbol separation for visual tasks, and therefore indicate appropriate choices for symbols. The resulting configurations are discussed, and a number of patterns in the relation between properties of the symbols and the resulting contrast are identified. In short we found that the size effect in the space is not linear and more dominant than shape effect."

The high number of objects in a simulation requires advanced visualization techniques: first to handle the large data sets, second to support the human perception in the crowded environment, and third to provide an interactive exploration tool. To adjust the state of the cell to an external signal, a specific set of signaling molecules transports the information to the nucleus deep inside the cell. There, key molecules regulate gene expression. In contrast to continuous ODE models we model all signaling molecules individually in a more realistic crowded and disordered environment. Beyond spatiotemporal concentration profiles our data describes the process on a mesoscopic, molecular level, allowing a detailed view of intracellular events. In our proposed schematic visualization individual molecules, their tracks, or reactions can be selected and brought into focus to highlight the signal transduction pathway. Segmentation, depth cues and depth of field are applied to reduce the visual complexity. We also provide a virtual microscope to display images for comparison with wet lab experiments. The method is applied to distinguish different transport modes of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling molecules in a cell. In addition, we simulate the diffusion of drug molecules through the extracellular space of a solid tumor and visualize the challenges in cancer related therapeutic drug delivery."

This new visualization exploits its adaptive nature to address issues like cluttered display, imperceptible hierarchy, lack of smooth zoom-in and out technique which are common in tree visualization. We also present an algorithm which utilizes the flexibility of our proposed technique to deal with occlusion, a problem inherent in any 3D information visualization. On one hand, our work establishes adaptive visualization as a means of displaying tree-structured data in 3D. On the other, it promotes the technique as a potential candidate for being employed to visualize other information structures also."

Our method extends an existing rendering technique for the so-called areas of interest in system architecture diagrams to visualize several metrics, possibly having missing values, defined on overlapping areas of interest. For this, we use a solution that combines texturing, blending, and smooth scattered-data point interpolation. Our new method simplifies the task of visually correlating the distribution and outlier values of a multivariate metric dataset with a system's structure. We demonstrate the application of our method on component and class diagrams extracted from real-world systems."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel out-of-core volume rendering algorithm for large time-varying fields. Exploring temporal and spatial coherences has been an important direction for speeding up the rendering of time-varying data. Previously, there were techniques that hierarchically partition both the time and space domains into a data structure so as to re-use some results from the previous time step in multiresolution rendering; however, it has not been studied on which domain should be partitioned first to obtain a better re-use rate. We address this open question, and show both theoretically and experimentally that partitioning the time domain first is better. We call the resulting structure (a binary time tree as the primary structure and an octree as the secondary structure) the space-partitioning time (SPT) tree. Typically, our SPT-tree rendering has a higher level of details, a higher re-use rate, and runs faster. In addition, we devise a novel cut-finding algorithm to facilitate efficient out-of-core volume rendering using our SPT tree, we develop a novel out-of-core preprocessing algorithm to build our SPT tree I/O-efficiently, and we propose modified error metrics with a theoretical guarantee of a monotonicity property that is desirable for the tree search. The experiments on datasets as large as 25GB using a PC with only 2GB of RAM demonstrated the efficacy of our new approach."

        "abstract": "To analyze time-varying data sets, tracking features over time is often necessary to better understand the dynamic nature of the underlying physical process. Tracking 3D time-varying features, however, is non-trivial when the boundaries of the features cannot be easily defined. In this paper, we propose a new framework to visualize time-varying features and their motion without explicit feature segmentation and tracking. In our framework, a time-varying feature is described by a time series or Time Activity Curve (TAC). To compute the distance, or similarity, between a voxel's time series and the feature, we use the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance metric. The purpose of DTW is to compare the shape similarity between two time series with an optimal warping of time so that the phase shift of the feature in time can be accounted for. After applying DTW to compare each voxel's time series with the feature, a time-invariant distance field can be computed. The amount of time warping required for each voxel to match the feature provides an estimate of the time when the feature is most likely to occur. Based on the TAC-based distance field, several visualization methods can be derived to highlight the position and motion of the feature. We present several case studies to demonstrate and compare the effectiveness of our framework."

        "abstract": "Diffusion tensor fields reveal the underlying anatomical structures in biological tissues such as neural fibers in the brain. Most current methods for visualizing the diffusion tensor field can be categorized into two classes: integral curves and glyphs. Integral curves are continuous and represent the underlying fiber structures, but are prone to integration error and loss of local information. Glyphs are useful for representing local tensor information, but do not convey the connectivity in the anatomical structures well. We introduce a simple yet effective visualization technique that extends the streamball method in flow visualization to tensor ellipsoids. Each tensor ellipsoid represents a local tensor, and either blends with neighboring tensors or breaks away from them depending on their orientations and anisotropies. The resulting visualization shows the connectivity information in the underlying anatomy while characterizing the local tenors in detail. By interactively changing an iso-value parameter, users can examine the diffusion tensor field in the entire spectrum between the continuous integral curves and the discrete glyphs. Expert evaluation indicates that this method conveys very useful visual information about local anisotropy in white matter fibers. Such information was previously unavailable in tractography models. Our method provides a visual tool for assessing variability in DTI fiber tract integrity and its relation to function."

We propose a new system called a Business Microscope that senses the activities of people in an organization and provides visual feedback to users. We use name-tag shaped sensor nodes to measure face-to-face interaction between employees. The massive amount of data collected by the sensor-network terminal are signal-processed by the server and displayed as an organization's topographic map that displays the frequencies of organizational activities. To depict the organization's topographic map, our system creates a novel relation tree using the interaction data from all pairs of members. In this kind of map, some groups in the organization hierarchically form islands. Members in those islands who have relationships with many others form mountains that are plotted with contours. We can comprehend the actual conditions of organizations from our topographic map. We tested our technique in several experiments to evaluate this system."

        "abstract": "Viewpoint selection is becoming a useful part in the volume visualization pipeline, as it further improves the efficiency of data understanding by providing representative viewpoints. We present two structure-aware view descriptors, which are the shape view descriptor and the detail view descriptor, to select the optimal viewpoint with the maximum amount of the structural information. These two proposed structure-aware view descriptors are both based on the gradient direction, as the gradient is a well-defined measurement of boundary structures, which have been proved as features of interest in many applications. The shape view descriptor is designed to evaluate the overall orientation of features of interest. For estimating local details, we employ the bilateral filter to construct the shape volume. The bilateral filter is very effective in smoothing local details and preserving strong boundary structures at the same time. Therefore, large-scale global structures are in the shape volume, while small-scale local details still remain in the original volume. The detail view descriptor measures the amount of visible details on boundary structures in terms of variances in the local structure between the shape volume and the original volume. These two view descriptors can be integrated into a viewpoint selection framework, and this framework can emphasize global structures or local details with flexibility tailored to the user's specific situations. We performed experiments on various types of volume datasets. These experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed view descriptors, and the proposed viewpoint selection framework actually locates the optimal viewpoints that show the maximum amount of the structural information."

However, our practical experience shows that in many cases, layout quality suffers as a result of non-uniform vertex density. This gives rise to warping effects in that vertices on the outskirt of the drawing are often closer to each other than those near the center, and branches in a tree-like graph tend to cling together. In this paper we propose algorithms that overcome these effects. The algorithms combine the efficiency and good global structure of the spring-electrical model, with the flexibility of the Kamada-Kawai stress model of in specifying the ideal edge length, and are very effective in overcoming the warping effects."

In this canonical matrix, nodes are ordered based on a breadth-first search spanning tree. Special rules and filters are designed to guarantee the uniqueness of an arrangement. Such a unique matrix representation provides persistence and a stability which can be used and harnessed in visualization, especially for data exploration and studies."
