        "abstract": "Summary form only given. Human intelligence is based on the functions of language. From this fact it is very natural to characterize an intelligent system by language: capability of handling language or capability of working with language. Discussing some issues of language related to intelligence, we focus on language functions of the brain in this talk. There are three approaches to elucidate the language functions of the brain: top-down, intermediate, and bottom-up. In this talk, we shall first see some examples of top-down and intermediate approaches, and then discuss a bottom-up approach. As a top-down approach we show computational models of language in which four principles are realized, and as an intermediate approach, we introduce the stratification in the brain shown by aphasia studies. As a bottom-up approach, we have conducted brain experiments, aiming to elucidate the difference of brain activities during processing ideational meaning and interpersonal meaning. In the experiments, two kinds of sentences with and without honorific expressions were sequentially shown to subjects, where texts with honorific expressions contain interpersonal meaning and texts without honorific expressions mainly hold ideational meaning. Electroencephalograms were measured to acquire event-related potentials. Then using equivalent current dipole source localization method, we analyzed the neuronal activation of the brain. It was found that the brain activities for understanding sentences with honorific expressions are different from those produced for understanding sentences without honorific expressions. Finally we shall discuss a brain mechanism possibly used for learning how to speak."

In this paper, we present a novel approach for facial micro-expressions recognition in video sequences. First, 200 frame per second (fps) high speed camera is used to capture the face. Second, the face is divided to specific regions, then the motion in each region is recognized based on 3D-Gradients orientation histogram descriptor. For testing this approach, we create a new dataset of facial micro-expressions, that was manually tagged as a ground truth, using a high speed camera. In this work, we present recognition results of 13 different micro-expressions."

The batteries of these PHEVs are designed to be charged at home, from a standard outlet in the garage, or on a corporate car park. These extra electrical loads have an impact on the distribution grid. The uncoordinated power consumption on a local scale can lead to grid problems. Therefore coordinated charging is proposed. The exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, so stochastic programming is introduced. The stochastic approach represents an error in the forecasting of the daily load profiles. Two main program techniques are analyzed: quadratic and dynamic programming. The coordination of the PHEVs reduces the power losses and improves the power quality. The estimation of the costs of grid reinforcement must be compared with the cost of the implementation of a smart metering system for the coordination of the charging."

This is drawing attention to techniques which will allow more efficient asset utilisation and facilitate network dynamic management. Power system component real-time ratings are a cost effective solution for increasing network power transfer capacity. Instantaneous ratings can be used for this purpose, but distribution network operator decision making capability regarding network power flow management would be enhanced by the adoption of rating forecasts. Therefore this paper presents an investigation into the technical challenges and potential benefits of power system component rating forecasts. Weather forecasts are used with power system component thermal models and a state estimation technique for calculating rating forecasts at different time horizons."

This paper presents an automated and statistical approach for load signature identification using clustering methods. One of the key advantages of the clustering method is its capability to identify the major loads accurately. We also investigate the effectiveness on accuracy improvement by pre-filtering the signals prior to cluster-creation and also performing consolidation after using automatic clustering. Actual trial data and results are presented in the paper to demonstrate the performance of the automated identification mechanism."

All the objective functions are subject to power flow equations, bus voltage limits, reactive power output of generators at voltage controlled buses, and limits of setting values for SVC and TCSC. An optimization technique based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to determine the optimal locations of SVC and TCSC and their corresponding setting values. A case study with a modified IEEE 14-bus system is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. It is found that the obtained optimal solutions meet the requirement of the objective functions while satisfying all the constraints. Numerical results for total real and reactive power losses, energy loss cost, installation cost, and total cost are also discussed."

In cluster formation, the nodes consider the complex distance of nodes to cluster head (CH) and CH to base station (BS), and join the cluster which the complex distance is minimum. This strategy balances the network energy efficiently. The communication of inter-cluster adopts multi-hop mode, which the next hop routing is chosen based on the network communication cost and the residual energy of CH, to make the network load more balanced. Simulation results show that this algorithm balances energy consumption among the network efficiently, and prolongs network lifetime."

Both features are robustly detected using the curvature of the surface normals to locate landmarks. Recognition results for a database of 40 individuals show that, individually, the new features out-perform an eigenface approach for an image of the nasal region. When combined they have a very respectable recognition rate for methods based on one dimensional features, indicating their potential for use within multi-feature recognition systems."

        "abstract": "This work mainly discusses the image plane of the Bistatic ISAR. The image plane is modeled by two different methods separately. One is modeling the image plane according to the bistatic SAR image plane; the other is to model the plane by target rotation vector analysis. The modeling process is presented in detail. Both the models are reasonable, but are different to each other. They are then testified by applying them to interpret the bistatic turntable model, and to predict the possible imaging result. The turntable imaging simulations perfectly match the predictions of the second model, which is built by target rotation vector analysis. Further simulations of moving point-scatter bistatic imaging also indicate the validity of the second model. The deficiency of the first model is also discussed."

Efficient solution for this problem is crucial in the development of automatic video surveillance and tracking systems. We present a background/foreground segmentation approach based on a subtraction of background model that combine color and optic flow information of the scene. A new technique to integrate optical flow information with color information in the background model is developed. The optical flow information complements a color background subtraction model based on spatially global Gaussian mixture. Experimental results that test the proposed approach showed better segmentation than color background/foreground segmentation approach."

To reduce these oscillations, this paper first synthesizes the basic V/f speed control for achieving appropriate V/f ratios and boost voltages under light and high loads in the low-frequency range. It also highlights and includes in tuning the impacts of motor parametric variations occurring during operation. The paper then optimizes a closed-loop control scheme for slip compensation with a PI (proportional-integral) controller by applying GA (genetic algorithm) for tuning its parameters. Simulation results show that the optimized closed-loop control stabilizes the operation of the motor drive at low frequencies. The optimized control achieves also near-zero steady-state speed errors for both light and high loads at frequencies above the motor minimum starting frequency."

Management and control of such small and medium-scale inverter-interfaced generation can be optimised using the virtual power plant (VPP) principle. Various control aspects of VPP as an attribute of the interconnected power system are analyzed, and the design of a small-scale experimental setup is proposed."

A set of eleven performance parameters, including power factor and line regulation, will be used in formulating the system performance index. By allowing a weighting factor to each parameter to reflect its relative importance in a specific application, a robust and realistic assessment of the system performance can be established."

The two established methods are the IEC 60599 gas-ratio method and Duval Triangle method. A platform called the Transformer Fault Clinic is designed and created for guiding the user to compare and combine the diagnosis results from the four methods. The DST combination approach estimates the belief levels of all the faults being diagnosed. Using this, the user will obtain a concrete overview of the insulation condition of a power transformer, and the nature and severity of the faults.

The existing power system provides the backbone to integrate new technologies using an optimal approach deploying existing components to support the integration to newer and diverse elements. Some examples of advanced system integration of hardware include advanced HVdc, UHV, Solid State controllers, multi-way communication, digital communications, etc. The power system rejuvenation and renewal, with advanced hardware to meet future consumer requirements, will provide substantial benefits. As a corollary, applications of intelligent devices are not immediately required system-wide. Necessarily, as with all other implementations of advanced technology in power systems, system applications focused on the power system rejuvenation, much like urban renewal programs, will begin with demonstrations on critical portions of the power system, meeting focused needs and with easily defined benefits, thus augmenting the existing power system. The full benefits will evolve towards a fuller implementation over time and will ensure that as new intelligent controllers become available, their integration will be easier and the full benefits realizable."

However, when considering distribution networks, reactive power may not be an effective mean for voltage control. This is because of the X/R ratio which determines the controllability of voltage through active and/or reactive power. Therefore, in this paper a voltage control scheme is proposed based on the estimation of the X/R ratio of the grid. The estimated X/R will then be used to determine the active and reactive power to be injected into the grid in order to keep the voltage between permissible limits."

In this research DPA, CPA and DFA attacks are performed on an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm using a Side-channel Attack Standard Evaluation Board (SASEBO-R). SASEBO-R is a circuit board that contains an ASIC cryptographic device and which was specifically designed with features to perform DPA attacks. In this paper improved DPA and DFA techniques are proposed to reduce the time complexity of both attacks as well as the number of samples required to reveal the secret key. Finally, a comparison between all of the attacks is provided in terms of both time complexity and effectiveness."

        "abstract": "Unlike a fixed-frequency power supply, the voltage supplying an inverter-fed motor is heavily corrupted by noises, which are produced from high-frequency switching leading to noisy stator currents. To extract useful information from stator-current measurements, a theoretically sound and robust de-noising method is required. The effective filtering of these noises is difficult with certain frequency-domain techniques, such as Fourier transform or Wavelet analysis, because some noises have frequencies overlapping with those of the actual signals, and some have high noise-to-frequency ratios. In order to analyze the statistical signatures of different types of signals, a certain number is required of the individual signals to be de-noised without sacrificing the individual characteristic and quantity of the signals. An ensemble and individual noised reduction (EINR) method is proposed as the extension of the common averaging method for induction-motor signature analysis. The signals after de-noising by the proposed EINR method will preserve the individual characteristics. A number of signals are selected as an ensemble part in the proposed EINR method and are employed as the “profile” to de-noise other individual signals. The case study presented in this paper demonstrates the merits of the proposed EINR method for induction-motor signature analysis."

        "abstract": "For many years, the standard model of an ionospheric channel used for analysis and performance evaluation of HF communications techniques has been the model of Watterson, as embodied in the ITU-R Recommendation Rec. F.1487. However, for the modern adaptive techniques used for HF communications, including automatic link establishment and data link protocols employing data rate adaptation and/or type II hybrid-ARQ techniques, this model is importantly incomplete. While it simulates quite adequately the signal perturbations (Doppler and multipath spread) observable over periods of up to a few seconds, this model fails to represent the variations in channel quality (specifically, signal to noise ratio - SNR) that occur over time periods of a few seconds to tens of minutes, and which can have a crucial impact on the performance of systems using such techniques. In recent work, Harris Corporation has recorded and analyzed extensive time series of SNR measurements on a sample of ionospheric channels, both long-haul and Near Vertically Incident Skywave (NVIS); developed a model framework capable of modelling the longer-term channel quality variation observed in these time series; incorporated the model framework into a Watterson-model channel simulator; and used this enhanced channel simulator to measure and analyze the impact of this longer-term channel variation on the performance of two widely-used HF data link protocols. This paper begins with an overview of the developed model and provides a synopsis of the work completed so far to validate the model. The paper continues with a brief discussion of the implementation of this model in a DSP or PC based real time HF channel simulator. Finally the paper proposes how best to incorporate this additional model in to an international standard such as ITU ITU-R Recommendation Rec. F.1487."

Pathological oscillatory neural activity is generated within the tremor (3-8 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma (30-90 Hz) frequency bands. Quenching of the oscillations by means of high frequency deep brain stimulation is illustrated. It is shown that interaction between sub-loops exhibiting tremor and gamma band activity can produce new oscillations within the beta band range, a frequency range clinically associated with increased bradykinesia and akinesia. It is similarly shown that interactions between neural circuits oscillating at the tremor and beta frequencies may result in oscillations at approximately twice the frequency of Parkinsonian tremor."

Therefore, lead compensation prevails in almost all stability studies and the effectiveness of PSSs with lead compensation was demonstrated by eigenvalue and swing plots, to confirm that their PSS designs can enhance the system damping under both small and large disturbances. The present paper will (a) explore whether the lead compensation of PSS has provided the correct phase compensation even with substantial improvements of system damping, and (b) highlight the risks due to lead compensation. A systematic technique based on eigenvalue sensitivity is recommended to effectively provide correct phase compensation and to suppress the risks in PSS tuning."

However, they are often complex and difficult to understand, because the formalism in which they are constructed and encoded is usually machine-oriented, and they may also be based on assumptions that are not justified. This causes concerns about the trustworthiness of using formal proofs as arguments in safety-critical applications. Here, we present an approach to develop safety cases that correspond to formal proofs found by automated theorem provers and reveal the underlying argumentation structure and top-level assumptions. We concentrate on natural deduction style proofs, which are closer to human reasoning than resolution proofs, and show how to construct the safety cases by covering the natural deduction proof tree with corresponding safety case fragments. We also abstract away logical book-keeping steps, which reduces the size of the constructed safety cases. We show how the approach can be applied to the proofs found by the Muscadet prover."

Intra-cluster base stations use interference cancellation techniques to the edge users in adjacent clusters in order to effectively eliminate inter-cluster interference, and then adopt linear beam forming to intra-cluster users to cooperatively suppress intra-cluster multi-user interference. Compared with dynamic clustering coordination strategy, proposed strategy can significantly reduce communication overhead between base stations as well as algorithm complexity. Simulation results show that performance of such coordination strategy outperforms single-cell processing and static clustering strategy, and continues to improve with the increase of inter-cluster coordinate distance. When cluster size is two-cell and Dedge equals to 0.7, performance of proposed strategy even becomes better than that of dynamic clustering."

However, most real optical systems will introduce some undesirable effects, rendering the assumption of the pin-hole camera model invalid. By far the most evident of these effects is radial distortion, particularly in fish-eye camera systems where the level of this distortion is relatively extreme. The aim of fish-eye distortion correction is, therefore, to transform the distorted view of fish-eye cameras to the desired rectilinear pin-hole perspective view. To perform this distortion correction, several authors have developed models of fish-eye distortion. It is the aim of this paper to examine the accuracy of several of the polynomial-based models against the equidistance mapping function, which is the most common mapping function that fish-eye lenses are designed to follow."

For system security consideration, some monitoring indexes of transmission congestion management should be presented to system operators. In this paper, the transmission congestion probability forecasting for power systems with high wind power integration is discussed, and a probabilistic forecasting method for ultra-short term transmission congestion is introduced. Probability distribution is applied to express the uncertainty brought by wind power integration in this paper. The proposed forecasting method applies the Boundary Load Flow and Newton power flow algorithm as the section power flow calculation framework, and obtains the probability distribution of section power flow through Monte Carlo Simulation in which antithetic variable sampling is used to reduce sampling frequency, and then the congestion probability of transmission sections is predicted. Simulation results of IEEE 39-bus system validate the efficiency of the proposed probabilistic forecasting method. The ultra-short term probabilistic forecasts of transmission congestion would provide monitoring index and information to system operators, which is helpful to relieve congestion scenario on the transmission sections."

So, the handoff, whose direction is consistent with the train's running direction, occurs only if the relative RSS (Received Signal Strength) measurement exceeds the pre-defined hysteresis; but, the handoff, whose direction is inconsistent with the train's running direction, occurs when not only the relative RSS measurement exceeds the pre-defined hysteresis, but also the random direction-lock is open. Finally, it's found that the proposed handoff algorithm could reduce the average number of handoffs about 25%, compared with the conventional handoff algorithm with a sole hysteresis."

Due to the low-level analog output of typical sensors, designing interface electronics that ldquodoes no harmrdquo, i.e. does not impair sensor performance, is quite challenging, especially in today's mainstream CMOS technology, whose inherent precision is limited by 1/f noise and component mismatch. However, since most sensors are quite slow compared to transistors, dynamic techniques can often be used to trade speed or bandwidth for higher precision. Examples of such techniques are auto zeroing, chopping, dynamic element matching, switched-capacitor filtering and sigma-delta modulation. This paper describes the use of such dynamic techniques in the design and realization of state-of-the-art smart CMOS temperature sensors."

One of the crucial problems during the adoption is the mobility of the sub-network which is complicated by the numerous IP nodes inside the airplane. The airplane has a worldwide mobility and the bandwidth of aviation data link is very limited, therefore it will bring great network overhead and handover delay when the airplane is communicating far away its home without a proper mobility management mechanism. A new mobility management mechanism for aviation mobile network is proposed in this paper. This mechanism employs Network Mobility (NEMO) to solve the mobility of sub-network inside an airplane and the NEMO route is optimized with a hierarchical strategy. Furthermore, a fast handover method is introduced into the proposed mechanism. The mechanism is discussed in detail and compared with the basic NEMO solution. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a better performance in route optimization and handover latency."

        "abstract": "The VLBI data acquisition backend plays an important role in the VLBI station. Recently, based on advances in digital hardware like ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion), DSP (Digital Signal Processing), FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) and so on, it has become practical to sample and digitally process the intermediate frequency signal directly. DBBC (Digital Base-Band Converters) will replace ABBC (Analog Base Band Converters) in the VLBI data acquisition backend. A wide band digital VLBI Digital Backend using poly-phase filter banks segments each 512MHz IF into 2n adjacent frequency channels spanning the 512MHz IF bandwidth, This paper analyzes the architectures of VLBI wideband DBBC and use a common deducing method to acquire an efficient architecture based DFT polyphase filter banks to realize wideband DBBC. the arithmetic operations and complexity is compared between the different architectures. A simulation model of poly-phase filter banks is designed. All the xperimental results show that the model is valid and practical."

This paper fully studys the mechanism of occurrence of the transient surge current and establishs mathmatical model for the calculation of it. This paper also gives the calculation fomulas of the maximum of the transient surge current and the maximum of effective value of the transient surge current. What's more, the occurring time of the maximum of the transient surge is presented . An equivalent model of local distribution network is developed to simulate the closing loop operation using PSCAD/EMTDC program A pre and post closing current curve is recorded simultaneously. Both the maximum of the transient surge current and the maximum of effective value of the transient surge current are read out from the simulation curve. Mealwhile, the maximum of the transient surge current and the maximum of effective value can be calculated from the .the calculation fomulas. By comparing the simulation and theoretical results, it is proved that the method for the calculation of transient surge current is suitable. The surge current in practice must't exceed the theoretical result in order to avoiding accident. It will be safe as long as acting within the theortical limits.

The commonly tax assessment methods only use tax-related data for classification, which can not meet the needs of the actual tax administration. Tax assessment usually takes decision tree algorithms as a method of classification. General decision tree algorithms take information gain as classified target, the training sample collections or the class tables request resident memory. The SPRINT algorithm uses Gini index to select attributes and eliminates all memories limit. The SPRINT algorithm and comprehensive fuzzy evaluation can be combined to generate a new tax assessment model. With this model a sequence can be generated by evaluating the tax-related data and the basic information of taxpayers. This model can solve the issues that the taxpayer's order of tax assessment which usually can not be scientifically determined. Experiments show that the decision tree algorithm can improve the accuracy of classification. The tax assessment model based on comprehensive fuzzy evaluation can evaluate the taxpayers, with this model a sequence can be generated for further checking. This tax assessment model is valuable for tax inspection."

In contrast to many existing quality of service mechanisms, our technique prioritizes best effort over guaranteed bandwidth traffic for optimal latency. Distributed traffic shaping is used to offer bandwidth guarantees over previously reserved connections, which are established dynamically using control messages. Initial simulation results show that our arbitration scheme can provide tight bandwidth guarantees for streaming traffic under network overload conditions. At the same time, the average latency of best effort traffic is improved compared to a simple prioritization of streaming traffic."

Given this background, by adding a capacity coefficient to the CPS formulas, the CPS assessment method is extended to accommodate generation units, and a new approach for assessing the AGC operation performance of generation units developed. The penalty for each provincial dispatch center, in the form of electricity amount, is then allocated to the generation units based on the assessment outcomes, and as a result, this could provide an efficient incentive for those units to improve their AGC operation performance. The proposed approach is consistent with the existing CPS assessment framework, and its emphasis is placed on the long-term AGC operation performance of the generation units. In this way, the AGC dynamic operation indices, such as the regulation rates and regulation accuracy, are not required, and hence the method could be implemented easily in actual power systems."

This paper presents a multi-cue methodology to detect and track pedestrians in real-time in the entrance gates using stationary CCD cameras. In the proposed method, the detection component includes finding local maximums in foreground mask of Gaussian mixture and ¿-shaped objects in the edge map by trained PCA. And the tracking engine employs a dynamic VCM with automated criteria based on the shape and size of detected human shaped entities. This new approach has several advantages. First, it uses a well-defined and robust feature space which includes polar and angular data. Furthermore due to its fast method to find human shaped objects in the scene, it's intrinsically suitable for real-time purposes. In addition, this approach verifies human formed objects based on PCA algorithm, which makes it robust in decreasing false positive cases. This novel approach has been implemented in a sacred place and the experimental results demonstrated the system's robustness under many difficult situations such as partial or full occlusions of pedestrians."

Coal-fired generation produced 49% of the electrical energy in North America and represented 32% of the installed summer capacity. Heavy and light oil is primarily used as a back-up fuel for natural gas. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable, that is, they draw on finite resources. In contrast, renewable energy resources — such as wind, solar, ocean, biomass, hydro, etc. can be replenished at a generally predictable rate. Government policy is the key driver for renewable energy expansion in the US and Canada. For example, over 50% of (non-hydro) renewable capacity additions in the US from the late 1990s through 2007 have occurred in states with mandatory Renewable Portfolio Standards. The proposed level of commitment to renewables offers many benefits as well as certain challenges. It is important to distinguish between variability and uncertainty when discussing planning and operations of the bulk power system. The effects of variability are different than the effects of uncertainty and the mitigation measures that can be used to address variability are different than the measures needed to address uncertainty. There is already some amount of variability and uncertainty on the bulk power system with regard to the demand in particular, and, to a lesser extent, with the generation. To accommodate higher penetrations level of variable generation, changes will be required to the traditional methods used by system planners and operators in order to maintain ongoing bulk power system reliability. While the focus of this paper is on the integration of wind generation, the conclusions and recommended actions may also apply to the integration of all types of variable generation technologies."

The clients adopt a progressive transmission strategy by comprehensive consideration of the needs of the client users, the networks conditions and the data characteristics. Once any length of forehead of a bit-stream is received by the client, it can be added to buffer for 3D scene reconstruction, greatly reducing the time of waiting for display. Then we adopt a LOD scene rendering algorithm based on view-dependent visible region, which reduces the data volume immensely that needs transmission immediately.

        "abstract": "This paper by the inventor presents the patented parallel flow intersection (paraflow or PFI) as a low cost alternative for reducing congestion on urban arterial streets. The public cost of traffic congestion is enormous in terms of delay and wasted fuel consumption. According to the Texas Transportation Institute, the cost of congestion in the United States for 2007 was $87 billion (US) in lost time and 2.8 billion gallons (10.6 billion liters) of wasted fuel. A single congested intersection can cost several million dollars annually and grade-separations are a high impact and high cost solution. One alternative to interchange construction, however, is the paraflow, an at-grade intersection that achieves high efficiency by reducing the number of signal phases per cycle to two or three. As a result, lost time is minimized at the intersection due to the compounding benefits of fewer all-red phases, shorter cycle length and less queue start-up and dispersion time to reach a level of capacity that can rival an interchange. And unlike other unconventional high capacity intersection designs, the paraflow provides intuitive direct left turns that are made nearly at the same location as a conventional intersection. Channelization and other traffic control measures provide positive guidance to give drivers confidence in making proper turn maneuvers. The paraflow can be expected to be safer for motorists than a conventional intersection since the paraflow has fewer crossing conflicts and no permitted left turns. Safety is also improved for pedestrians and bicyclists by again eliminating permitted left turns, providing traffic islands that serve as refuges, and shorter crossings at crosswalks. The paraflow is adaptable to the physical site and can maintain or improve access to corner properties. The paraflow can be constructed in various forms both at-grade and grade-separated. In combination with other high capacity intersect"

The conventional standard for data collection and statistical processing is Lee's criteria. It utilizes linear averaging to process sampling data, as many other related papers discussed. However, the accuracy of such first order moment estimation is low, especially under serious Rayleigh fading channels. As regards to the defects of the method, we propose four novel statistical processing methods to process the collected data for wireless field strength. Computer simulations and corresponding analysis verify its much better prediction results with small estimation variances."

The experiment results show that non-additive collaborative information coverage approach not only can reduce to the probability coverage approach for the perfect information acquisition scenario, but also can adjust the parameters adaptively to handle different information acquisition behavior in a practical sensor network, which is a more ubiquitous information coverage approach."

The CFD technique is introduced to investigate its aerodynamic performance. The results indicate that the new type of WS-VAWT can smooth away the defects of the traditional VAWT and hope to improve its efficiency. Optimum values of the inclination angle β between the bottom of windshield and x axis and Camber of bowed blade giving highest values of the torque, have been systematically researched.

The model attempts to maximise the expected profit of the portfolio when exposed to imbalance prices and output uncertainty. Portfolios analysed included conventional generators, wind generators, or both. The results indicate that the proposed approach is able to adapt the offering strategy to the risk profile in different times of the day. Also, significant synergic effects are demonstrated when wind and conventional generators are aggregated into a single portfolio, due to increased flexibility in internal portfolio balancing."

Simulations in Matlab prove the feasibility of this new signal as well as how to improve its performance, mainly by enlarging the bandwidth and adding window functions. In this case, the performance of zero-IF transceivers may be improved and the efficiency of distance range resolution can still be guaranteed."

The problem is that if you don't know what your risks how can you mange them and how can you make the right decisions? Over the next 10–15 years, European Air Traffic Management (ATM) is faced with the biggest set of operational and technological changes in its history. To meet this challenge, EUROCONTROL has developed the Integrated Risk Picture (IRP) - a model which not only gives a much clearer understanding of current ATM-related risks but also is capable of predicting how those risks will change in response to the planned changes to the ATM system. This paper describes the form and uses of the IRP."

Through analysing the local uniform asymptotical stability at origin and the instability of isolated boundary equilibrium state at non-origin under the proposed trajectory tracking control law, the scale of control parameters is confirmed. By Lyapunov candidate function method, this paper concludes that the elosed-loop system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable at origin.

From characteristic analysis, we estimate the effective frequency band which the lumped parameters circuit can be taken as the equivalent of transmission line. Considering the width of effective frequency and complex degree of model equation, the selection method for application is proposed. The research results showed that π section has the best approximation and Γ section has the simplest model equation. The proper application of selection method for the equivalent circuit can significantly increase the convenience and effectiveness for power system calculations."

Recent blackouts around the world are investigated and their mechanisms are revealed. The three-defense-lines criterion, which is the security standard for power system in China, is thoroughly reviewed. It is suggested to advance the existing SCADA/EMS systems to dynamic ones, namely DSCADA/DEMS. Based on relevant research achievements, such a system, named as Wide ARea Monitoring Analysis Protection-control (WARMAP), is well on the way to building in both East China Power Grid and Jiangsu Power Grid."

We assess the current IT in education and e-learning support systems and technologies, and discuss the potentialities of e-learning to serve as a driving force for reformation and innovation in higher education. We further describe our concept of growing campus toward universal provision of an amenity learning environment and educational service that best fits everyone's need and learning style, and the framework of u3-campus (ubiquitous, universal and unlimited campus) with an ultimate goal of unlimited learning. We emphasize the importance of paradigm shift from technology-driven to human-centric in pursuit of wellbeing in education. Finally, we envision the future IT in education, and address some key issues and challenges."

With the backward-channel transmission rate constraint, in the periodic feedback system, we further analyze the relations between the ergodic capacity and the feedback cycles. We found that there exists an optimal feedback cycle in terms of the ergodic capacity given the feedback capacity constraint."

However, the increasing popular of taxi has brought several problems to urban traffic. The current study is to explore the characteristics and safety of taxi lane changing behavior on urban road. The initial collected data provide evidence that taxis are more frequently to change lanes with smaller space than other public vehicles. Furthermore, safety of taxi driving behavior is examined quantificationally using several analysis models and examples. Results suggest that the frequent and risk-taking lane changes make traffic flow to be unstable and increase the possibilities exposed to crashes."

Though location methods based on learning theory perform well in NLOS environments, these methods may be further improved since they do not consider outliers in the training data set. In this letter, we extend least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithm to general cost functions, and use this algorithm to solve mobile location problem. The proposed method can effectively suppress outliers with weight function. Specially, LS-SVM algorithm can be interpreted as special case of our algorithm. Simulation results show that the location accuracy is significantly improved over traditional algorithms."

In this paper, we derive the image spectrum of the moving target after two representative fine resolution SAR image formation algorithms, i.e., the range migration algorithm (RMA), and the polar format algorithm (PFA), respectively. Based on the spectrum derived, detailed analysis on the SAR signatures of moving target, including the geometric displacement, residual range migration, and the defocusing effect in both the range and azimuth dimensions are performed."

The proposed PSO-based approach is demonstrated on the Nordic 32 test system. Test results show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective in the preventive control problem of dynamic voltage security."

At the aspect of bidding strategies, Gencos under both mechanisms all have the propensity to bid higher price deviating from cost, Gencos will take different bidding strategies under different auction mechanisms, there exists certain market power.

Furthermore, such Doppler spread can't be compensated accurately in non-cooperative situations. As a result, traditional demodulation methods which require carrier synchronization will be quite limited in use. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a new demodulation algorithm based on the instant frequency distribution characteristics of Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) signals, as well as wavelet transform. A real experiment and some simulation results show that, the newly proposed algorithm is still applicable in high dynamic circumstance, and its symbol error rate is only 3 dB worse than the corresponding theoretical lower bound."

We describe analysis of network log data collected from E-Comm, a public safety trunked radio network that utilizes circuit-switched cellular wireless technology. We examine statistical distributions and autocorrelation functions of call inter-arrival and call holding times during busy hours. Our findings indicate that traditional Er land models used for voice traffic may not be suitable for evaluating the performance of trunked radio networks. We also describe collection of traffic data, characterization of traffic loads, and distribution of packet sizes in ChinaSat, a hybrid satellite-terrestrial system. We investigate long-range dependence as the traffic patterns very, propose a traffic model for the transmission control protocol (TCP) connections, and use data from billing records to predict future traffic loads. Since discovering network topology is important for analyzing routing protocols and network robustness and resilience, we also examine datasets from the route views and RIPE projects and identify important properties of Internet graphs. Our current traffic measurement project deals with traffic collection from BC. Net, the Vancouver lower mainland gigabit Ethernet network. Collected data will be used to analyze behavior and performance of the border gateway protocol (BGP)."

It is firstly constructed by a basic protograph based accumulate-repeat-accumulate (ARA) code and then extended to a generalized LDPC (GLDPC) code where a parity check node is replaced by a more powerful hamming node. It is implemented in the form of quasi-cyclic (QC) which saves memory resources and greatly reduces the complexity of both encoding and decoding. So the code is called as QCARA GLDPC code since it has features of QC, ARA and GLDPC. Simulation results show that the code designed by the proposed method can achieve lower decoding complexity and less decoding latency at the cost of just 0.3 dB performance loss when compared to the Turbo code of the consultative committee for space data systems (CCSDS) with the same code rate at bit-error-rate (BER) of 10−5."

Therefore, traditional multiprocessor Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scheduling algorithm can not be directly applied to sensor task scheduling. This paper proposes a Multi-objective Optimal DAG Scheduling (MODAGS) algorithm for wireless sensor networks. Its central idea is to exploit heuristic optimization algorithms and strategies respectively to realize multi-objective optimization in the task scheduling of wireless sensor networks. Then, take those results of single-objective optimal task scheduling as the initial particle swarm in the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. By way of redefinition of operations in the PSO algorithm, the task scheduling in wireless sensor networks is optimized synthetically. Experimental results show that: combining heuristic optimization algorithm with bionic algorithm, the optimization technology has good realtime performance and high efficiency of energy."

        "abstract": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) remains a threat to exhaust network bandwidth and host resources. Majority of DDOS attack tools utilize IP Spoofing technology that makes it very difficult to filter illegimate packets from aggregated traffic. Contrast to easy forgery of source IP address in the IP header, Time-to-Live (TTL) value is steady relatively. Based on this observation, Wang [1] proposed a scheme called hop-count filtering (HCF) for filtering illegimate packets from aggregated traffic. Wang's HCF is located in an end-system. In this paper, we introduce a method called distributed HCF (DHCF). Different from [1], DHCF is put in an intermediate-system. It has the advantage for resolving the problems of network bandwidth jam and host resources exhaustion. Comparing the performances of DHCF to HCF on the platform of NS2, our experiments exhibit that DHCF has better performance to relax network jam and maintain normal users' access."

Frequency offset estimation may be completed by one PN training sequence or two identical sequences and the algorithm is suitable to use in extensive situations."

In order to reinforce the analysis, we first propose a novel multi-channel simulator that produces realistic time-series of the fading process affecting signal transmission in satellite communication environments. The proposed simulator takes into account the temporal, spatial and polarization properties affecting these processes. Finally, we analyse the impact of depolarization on the total capacity of the tetrahedron Compact MIMO antenna system. Simulation results show a significant drop in performance as the cross polar discrimination decreases."

It is applied to Central Networks' Skegness to Boston 132kV line and co-ordinates with their control system in case the latter fails. DLR is a cost effective alternative to re-inforcing the overhead lines where there is a constraint to the DG connection due to the fixed line ratings. Analysis of the site data shows a close co-ordination between the actual and the theoretical calculations of the conductor temperature. The conservative assumptions made about wind direction and solar radiation are also shown to provide a good safety margin."

With so many transistors in a single chip, many dream applications become possible. Designers are eager to use those tremendous capacity of the integration circuits to bring more intelligent, more smart functions. One of the challenge target is can we design the circuits to make the SOC perform tasks that humans do quickly and easily? Can we make the computer to recognize images, understand language, learn knowledge, and control robots? In this presentation, the concept of Bio-inspiring computing which takes the advantages of neural science will be described. Some previous studies tried to explain the behavior of the human neocortex and provide a framework for building models that could be implemented and executed with Tera-scale SOC. Research suggested that the structure of the neocortex is hierarchical, and that the emulation of 6 levels of hierarchy is sufficient to achieve sophisticated recognition and analysis of visual images. Some experimental results will be presented to demo the possibility. It could be the dawn of the age of intelligence machines and neocortical computing. There will be many opportunities that Tera-scale SOC could create."

Probabilistic power system stability assessment and probabilistic power system planning have been identified by EPRI as one of the important trends in power system operations and planning. Probabilistic small signal stability assessment studies the impact of system parameter uncertainties on system small disturbance stability characteristics. Researches in this area have covered many uncertainties factors such as controller parameter uncertainties and generation uncertainties. One of the most important factors in power system stability assessment is load dynamics. In this paper, composite load model is used to consider the uncertainties from load parameter uncertainties impact on system small signal stability characteristics. The results provide useful insight into the significant stability impact brought to the system by load dynamics. They can be used to help system operators in system operation and planning analysis."

The results turn that coherent correlation non-coherent accumulation has the advantage of efficiency in time process, while the bit-edge guess algorithm gains better in detection possibility. As for the coherent correlation with differential accumulation it has larger output SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) then the coherent correlation with non-coherent accumulation in the same condition. Further work will be done to realize real time acquisition in a software platform receiver based on the useful analysis above."
