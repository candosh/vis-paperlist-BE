        "abstract": "We present a novel concept, Virtualized Traffic, to reconstruct and visualize continuous traffic flows from discrete spatiotemporal data provided by traffic sensors or generated artificially to enhance a sense of immersion in a dynamic virtual world. Given the positions of each car at two recorded locations on a highway and the corresponding time instances, our approach can reconstruct the traffic flows (i.e., the dynamic motions of multiple cars over time) between the two locations along the highway for immersive visualization of virtual cities or other environments. Our algorithm is applicable to high-density traffic on highways with an arbitrary number of lanes and takes into account the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic constraints on the cars. Our method reconstructs the car motion that automatically minimizes the number of lane changes, respects safety distance to other cars, and computes the acceleration necessary to obtain a smooth traffic flow subject to the given constraints. Furthermore, our framework can process a continuous stream of input data in real time, enabling the users to view virtualized traffic events in a virtual world as they occur. We demonstrate our reconstruction technique with both synthetic and real-world input."

        "abstract": "This paper describes an automatic mechanism for drawing metro maps. We apply multicriteria optimization to find effective placement of stations with a good line layout and to label the map unambiguously. A number of metrics are defined, which are used in a weighted sum to find a fitness value for a layout of the map. A hill climbing optimizer is used to reduce the fitness value, and find improved map layouts. To avoid local minima, we apply clustering techniques to the map-the hill climber moves both stations and clusters when finding improved layouts. We show the method applied to a number of metro maps, and describe an empirical study that provides some quantitative evidence that automatically-drawn metro maps can help users to find routes more efficiently than either published maps or undistorted maps. Moreover, we have found that, in these cases, study subjects indicate a preference for automatically-drawn maps over the alternatives."

        "abstract": "In three-dimensional medical imaging, segmentation of specific anatomy structure is often a preprocessing step for computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) purposes, and its performance has a significant impact on diagnosis of diseases as well as objective quantitative assessment of therapeutic efficacy. However, the existence of various diseases, image noise or artifacts, and individual anatomical variety generally impose a challenge for accurate segmentation of specific structures. To address these problems, a shape analysis strategy termed “break-and-repair” is presented in this study to facilitate automated medical image segmentation. Similar to surface approximation using a limited number of control points, the basic idea is to remove problematic regions and then estimate a smooth and complete surface shape by representing the remaining regions with high fidelity as an implicit function. The innovation of this shape analysis strategy is the capability of solving challenging medical image segmentation problems in a unified framework, regardless of the variability of anatomical structures in question. In our implementation, principal curvature analysis is used to identify and remove the problematic regions and radial basis function (RBF) based implicit surface fitting is used to achieve a closed (or complete) surface boundary. The feasibility and performance of this strategy are demonstrated by applying it to automated segmentation of two completely different anatomical structures depicted on CT examinations, namely human lungs and pulmonary nodules. Our quantitative experiments on a large number of clinical CT examinations collected from different sources demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and generality of the shape “break-and-repair” strategy in medical image segmentation."

        "abstract": "Artists use different means of stylization to control the focus on different objects in the scene. This allows them to portray complex meaning and achieve certain artistic effects. Most prior work on painterly rendering of videos, however, uses only a single painting style, with fixed global parameters, irrespective of objects and their layout in the images. This often leads to inadequate artistic control. Moreover, brush stroke orientation is typically assumed to follow an everywhere continuous directional field. In this paper, we propose a video painting system that accounts for the spatial support of objects in the images or videos, and uses this information to specify style parameters and stroke orientation for painterly rendering. Since objects occupy distinct image locations and move relatively smoothly from one video frame to another, our object-based painterly rendering approach is characterized by style parameters that coherently vary in space and time. Space-time-varying style parameters enable more artistic freedom, such as emphasis/de-emphasis, increase or decrease of contrast, exaggeration or abstraction of different objects in the scene in a temporally coherent fashion."

        "abstract": "Euler diagrams have a wide variety of uses, from information visualization to logical reasoning. In all of their application areas, the ability to automatically layout Euler diagrams brings considerable benefits. In this paper, we present a novel approach to Euler diagram generation. We develop certain graphs associated with Euler diagrams in order to allow curves to be added by finding cycles in these graphs. This permits us to build Euler diagrams inductively, adding one curve at a time. Our technique is adaptable, allowing the easy specification, and enforcement, of sets of well-formedness conditions; we present a series of results that identify properties of cycles that correspond to the well-formedness conditions. This improves upon other contributions toward the automated generation of Euler diagrams which implicitly assume some fixed set of well-formedness conditions must hold. In addition, unlike most of these other generation methods, our technique allows any abstract description to be drawn as an Euler diagram. To establish the utility of the approach, a prototype implementation has been developed."

        "abstract": "The goal of our work is to develop a programmatically controlled peer to bicycle with a human subject for the purpose of studying how social interactions influence road-crossing behavior. The peer is controlled through a combination of reactive controllers that determine the gross motion of the virtual bicycle, action-based controllers that animate the virtual bicyclist and generate verbal behaviors, and a keyboard interface that allows an experimenter to initiate the virtual bicyclist's actions during the course of an experiment. The virtual bicyclist's repertoire of behaviors includes road following, riding alongside the human rider, stopping at intersections, and crossing intersections through specified gaps in traffic. The virtual cyclist engages the human subject through gaze, gesture, and verbal interactions. We describe the structure of the behavior code and report the results of a study examining how 10- and 12-year-old children interact with a peer cyclist that makes either risky or safe choices in selecting gaps in traffic. Results of our study revealed that children who rode with a risky peer were more likely to cross intermediate-sized gaps than children who rode with a safe peer. In addition, children were significantly less likely to stop at the last six intersections after the experience of riding with the risky than the safe peer during the first six intersections. The results of the study and children's reactions to the virtual peer indicate that our virtual peer framework is a promising platform for future behavioral studies of peer influences on children's bicycle riding behavior."

Images of a model in the real world, captured by a camera above the scene, are processed to construct a virtual 3D model. To achieve interactive rendering rates, we use a hybrid rendering technique, leveraging radiosity to simulate the interreflectance between diffuse patches and shadow volumes to generate per-pixel direct illumination. The rendered images are then projected on the real model by four calibrated projectors to help users study the daylighting illumination. The virtual heliodon is a physical design environment in which multiple designers, a designer and a client, or a teacher and students can gather to experience animated visualizations of the natural illumination within a proposed design by controlling the time of day, season, and climate. Furthermore, participants may interactively redesign the geometry and materials of the space by manipulating physical design elements and see the updated lighting simulation."

        "abstract": "Cube mapping is widely used in many graphics applications due to the availability of hardware support. However, it does not sample the spherical surface evenly. Recently, a uniform spherical mapping, isocube mapping, was proposed. It exploits the six-face structure used in cube mapping and samples the spherical surface evenly. Unfortunately, some texels in isocube mapping are not rectilinear. This nonrectilinear property may degrade the filtering quality. This paper proposes a novel spherical mapping, namely unicube mapping. It has the advantages of cube mapping (exploitation of hardware and rectilinear structure) and isocube mapping (evenly sampling pattern). In the implementation, unicube mapping uses a simple function to modify the lookup vector before the conventional cube map lookup process. Hence, unicube mapping fully exploits the cube map hardware for real-time filtering and lookup. More importantly, its rectilinear partition structure allows a direct and real-time acquisition of the texture environment. This property facilitates dynamic environment mapping in a real time manner."
