In the experiments using Cityscapes dataset, the images are scaled by various rates and the CNN architecture named DeepLabv3 is trained with different hyperparameters using these images. After the training phase, the success rates of the trained models were compared. The most successful DeepLabv3 model has achieved a success rate of 78.83% on Cityscapes test set. Afterwards, an ensemble of two different DeepLabv3 models and the Extended DeepLabv3 model is tested. In test results, while the success rate remains nearly the same, an increase in classes such as road and sidewalk is observed."

This paper examines the implementation of PSO and GA algorithms to solve the optimization problem of two portfolios, Borsa Istanbul (BIST) and Cryptocurrency Exchange (KPB). This study also uses Markowitz mean variance method, that is, variance method for risk minimization and mean method for profit maximization. PSO and GA varying coefficients are compared in terms of sharpe risk percentage and portfolio profit. The comparison result is in favor of PSO algorithm."

For the segmentation process, deep-learning can be performed with local small patches obtained from the digital image, and pixel-based systems can be developed by using semantic segmentation technique. In this study, histopathological images obtained from hematoxylin and eosin staining are used for biopsy samples taken for diagnosis of breast cancer. The studies were performed in Matlab environment by using SegNet and U-Net algorithms and the accuracy of semantic segmentation was evaluated comparatively."

Choosing the most appropriate sensor node as Cluster Head (CH) among the clustered sensors according to the predetermined criteria decreases the energy consumption. In this study, the most frequent clustering algorithms in the literature are included and these algorithms are compared based on certain metrics. As a result of the comparison, advantages and disadvantages of clustering algorithms are indicated."

Some of intelligent edge devices also become equipping ASIC or IP cores including such massively parallel multiply-accumulators optimized for specific machine learning applications at low-power consumption. This presentation introduces our current research activities in analog-based machine learning accelerators and analog-based spiking neural network processors aiming at high performance per power in machine learning applications by taking advantage of high-speed and low-power analog multiply-accumulation arithmetic over densely-packed synaptic non-volatile memory (NVM) resistive device arrays."

In order to carry out the measurements in the laboratory environment, a model silo corresponding to 8% of the actual commercial silo was produced by a 3D printer and the radar measurements were performed in the frequency band of 18 - 40 GHz. In the proposed method, 2000 back scattering information belonging to different levels of grain were collected and they were used as input data to the extreme learning machine (ELM). The accuracy of the algorithm was obtained by K-fold cross validation technique. As a result, the ELM algorithm was determined the grain amount with an accuracy rate of 84%. The results show that the measurement system based on machine learning is more practical than traditional methods."

Operations leaders are being asked to deliver more across KPIs—such as throughput, costs, efficiency, quality, and sustainability—and asked to deliver incremental improvement every year.The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has brought much promise: more sensors, more connectivity, more data, better controls, more tools and methods to make sense of the data, and a greater understanding of consequences. But for all its promise, results have been stubbornly slow. Assets are increasingly complex, inter-dependencies are difficult to understand and real-time externalities are impacting these systems--often with unforeseen consequences.The confluence of AI and advanced analytics, however, can get business leaders the transformational results they desire. These technologies can break through data silos and analyze your operations holistically to provide deeper insights that humans and advanced controls can act on. And it can all happen in real-time. AI and advanced Analytics can help you better visualize the butterfly effect, understand how decisions about maintenance of one asset will impact another, and help business leaders to obtain the agility their businesses so desperately need."

As result, we are moving from a classical electromechanical system to a fully electronic driven system. This change is significantly affecting the dynamics of the power system but also opening completely new opportunities. The presentation will introduce recent studies in the field of dynamic integration of inverters in power grids showing that power electronics can be seen more as opportunities than as a problem. While a full concept of automation for future power system is still part of research, interesting options are emerging showing how the future power electronics-based power system could be actually more reliable than the classical power system."

It argues that in the more recent nodes, the total chip power (energy-per-operation) has scaled much less than that of earlier CMOS nodes. If the present trends continue, it will spell challenge in continuing Moore's Law. Improving the chip power scaling in the future nodes is critical, especially as it relates to high performance microprocessors."

Artificial intelligence is more and more responsible for decisions that have a huge impact on our lives. But predictions made using data mining and algorithms can affect population subgroups differently. Academic researchers and journalists have shown that decisions taken by predictive algorithms sometimes lead to biased outcomes, reproducing inequalities already present in society. Is it possible to make a fairness-aware data mining process? Are algorithms biased because people are too? Or is it how machine learning works at the most fundamental level?"

Within the last few years, high-resolution medical imaging technologies have grown in popularity for research in software engineering in general and program comprehension in particular. New approaches such function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) complement more established approaches such as eye tracking and electroencephalograms (EEG), helping us to augment unreliable or subjective self-reporting with more objective measures of the neurobiological correlates of software engineering. This keynote summarizes recent exciting results using such techniques, from multiple authors, contrasting them to more traditional studies. We highlight the “game changing” areas of program comprehension that can be more rigorously targeted with these approaches (including expertise, efficiency, and problem difficulty, among others). We also lay out a number of the challenges associated with such studies (including experimental design, statistical analysis, regulatory compliance, reproducibility, and cost, among others). We conclude with a call to arms, surveying compelling ideas and experiments from psychology that have not yet been applied to program comprehension research."

Since ITU officially defined service category and key performance indicators in 2015 (2-3 years after the concept was 1st brought up), the progress of the standard specifications and industrial development have moved fairly fast. 3GPP has released R15 5GNR technical specification for NSA (Non-Stand Alone) and SA (Stand Alone) by now and is expected to release R16 specification by the end of 2019. The industry is geared for 5G field trials, and launch ofcommercial services in 2019 and 2020. In the meantime, field trials/testbeds for non-traditional vertical applications are also being deployed worldwide to explore new services and to create new business models associated with these services. Though commercial launches of 5G services are expected in 2020-2021 time frame, it is a general consensus that eMBB service will be offered initially. It is also believed that 4G and 5G networks will likely co-exist and remain complementary for many years from operator point of view. Once 5G commercial system is launched, what will be next beyond 2020-21?In this talk, an overview ofworld-wide 5G activities including standardization, trials, spectrum policy will be presented first followed by summary of on-going/planned field trials/testbeds in Taiwan.

In this study, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), which is widely used in imbalanced classification problems, is discussed with Boosting. Using the proposed approach, the noise problem after SMOTE is solved with the help of Boosting procedure. This approach was implemented using C4.5 decision tree method on 5 different datasets.

Our experimental results show that our trained Resnet- 18 neural network can improve the top-1 and top-5 accuracies of Tiny-ImageNet dataset by the average of 11.02% and 9.21% compared with the previous work without using the scaling factor. The top-1 and top-5 accuracy losses compared with float-point weights are only about 0.5% and 0.31% under the truncated size of 5-bit. The proposed method can be applied for neural network accelerators especially for those which support bit-serial processing."

One challenge in predictable execution is that Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) cells must be refreshed periodically to maintain data validity, yet memory remains blocked during refresh, which results in overly pessimistic WCET bounds. This work contributes \"Colored Refresh\" to hide DRAM refresh overhead while preserving real-time schedulability for cyclic executives, which are widely used in highly critical systems. Colored Refresh partitions DRAM memory at rank granularity such that refreshes rotate round-robin from rank to rank. Real-time tasks are assigned different ranks via colored memory allocation. By cooperatively scheduling real-time tasks and refresh operations, memory requests no longer suffer from refresh interference. This reduces memory access latencies for tasks irrespective of DRAM density and size. Hence, Colored Refresh reduces a task's WCET and makes its execution more predictable."

Spoken Term Detection (STD) is the task of detecting a given word or phrase in audio. STD has applications in audio indexing and mining. In this work, we explore Spoken Term Detection for code-switched conversational Hindi-English speech. Code-switching provides various challenges to this problem, including, 1. lack of training data to build robust code-switched Automatic Speech Recog- nition (ASR) systems, 2. non-standardized transcription due to borrowing and cross-transcription, 3. presence of translated or code-switched variants of the terms. In this work, we assume that a code-switched ASR System for Hindi-English does not exist, and make use of only a monolingual Hindi ASR to retrieve audio containing Hindi and English keywords. We use various techniques to normalize the output of a monolingual ASR system. We evaluate our techniques using Term Weighted Value (TWV) and find that phonetic matching of the query and ASR hypotheses at the utterance level is the most promising approach. "

The proposed MDLL-based digital CDR uses 2x-oversampling technique to lower the bit error rate (BER) and achieves fast lock time using an initial tracking mode. A multi-phase MDLL is utilized to provide the 8- phase reference clocks needed for the PI-based CDR, thereby achieving the power reduction effect. A near-ground signaling (NGS) receiver with a passive CTLE is used for lower power operation at 20 Gbps/channel. The proposed 20 Gbps CDR with receiver equalization is implemented in a 40nm CMOS process, achieving a power consumption of only 25.0 mW (=1.25 mW/Gb/s)."

Furthermore, song preferences will be altering based on the current mood of the users. If these problems were not addressed, then these online services will fail to achieve user satisfaction. To cope with those problems, this paper proposes a novel music recommendation approach that utilizes social media content such as posts, comments, interactions, etc. and recommend them with the most relevant songs to relax their mind considering the current mood (happy, sad, calm and angry)."

This talk includes our recently progress of flexible techniques in circuit and system aspects, respectively. In circuit level, we propose a novel logic array design based on pseudo-CMOS logic to address the problems of unipolar TFT circuit design. A multilayer interconnection architecture is presented to improve the routability of circuit and the area efficiency. Cell mapping and wire routing algorithms, which aim to map the logic gates of circuit to logic array and then route the interconnection wires, are devised to improve the performance of circuit in consideration of parameter variations of TFT and meanwhile enhance the routability. In system level, we present a large-area flexible capacitive sensing oriented system on chip to achieve accurate and energy-efficient sensing. An adaptive sampling scheme is proposed to exploit the sparsity of large-area sensing applications, which achieves 116x reduction in sampling energy with assistance of binary-neural-network (BNN) accelerator and low-power capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC). Finally, we will conclude the talk and propose several potential research directions."

This paper introduces a new feature selection method called Interaction Dominance Based Feature Selection (IDFS), which employs the dominance of mutual information as a measure of the relevance of feature and the class, the dominance count of three-way interaction information as a measure of feature redundancy. A forward greedy search strategy is used to select features which have maximum sum of dominance count. The experimental results of six real world datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The method is compared with four Well-known feature ranking methods; Mutual Information Based Feature Selection (MIFS), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), Joint Mutual Information (JMI), and Double Input Symmetrical Relevance (DISR). The average classification accuracy of three different types of classifiers including C4.5, IB1 and PART is used to evaluate the performance of the IDFS method. The results show that IDFS outperforms the other methods."

In this review paper, the harmonic distortion problem is viewed as a multiuser detection problem in communications. Digital compensation techniques can then be employed to significantly improve HRM performance. Furthermore, the insights gained from this perspective are used to also suppress the intermodulation distortion products. A prototype chip has been built as proof of concept."

        "abstract": "Autoencoder is a neural network model which extracts the best representing features of data by performing unsupervised prelearning. Existing autoencoder approaches have been developed for applications that can access all data set at a time. However, the existing autocoders fail to satisfy for data stream applications that does not have access to the entire data set at once and and requires instant response. Therefore, this study presents an online sequential autocoder approach for data stream. The proposed autoencoder approach is based on the Extreme Learning Machines Autoencoder (ELM-AE) and adapts ELM-AE to be incremental learning algorithm. Therefore, Online Sequential-ELM (OS-ELM) algorithm which is incremental learning algorithm for data stream is integrated into ELM-AE in this paper. The proposed approach is tested on KddCup99, Poker, Pendigits, Hyperplane and ElecNormNews data stream sets which are commonly used in literature and achieved results demonstrate proposed approach's success."

For this purpose, the effects of ROS, SMOTE, RUS and NM algorithms on the logistic regression classifier were analyzed by using word-based N-gram structures on three different sentiment analysis datasets containing both Turkish and English texts. As a result, it has been found out that the sample increase methods (ROS, SMOTE) increase the classifier performance values and the sample reduction methods (RUS and NM) decrease the performance values on the data sets and the results are explained in detail."

        "abstract": "The proposal of using Software Defined Networking (SDN) techniques for operating optical transport networks has received a lot of attention. This approach provides centralised planning and control of network resources while collecting status and telemetry from the network to provide feedback and help with planning the delivery of services and optimising the network. A key component of SDN is how the central planning and management components communicate with the network equipment. The current approaches depend on a data model for each device, protocol, or component that is being controlled. These data models are most often written in the YANG language and passed between controller and device using the NETCONF protocol. Over the last several years a number of different standards organisations and open source initiatives have developed distinct modelling approaches for use in optical transport networks. Although the objectives are always the same, the models differ in details and high-level architecture meaning that equipment vendors, network management system developers, and network operators have to make choices or be faced with a complex ecosystem. It would be helpful if the various models and approaches could be consolidated to reduce the options while retaining flexible, high function. This paper makes a comparative analysis of the different data models available with a view to helping decision-makers understand the choices available."

Similarly, testability is a residual software property which the developers and users no longer ignore. This is because if the testability of software is high, the test effort and development cost decrease proportionally. This is the case because test effort is highly affected by testability. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between test effort and success of the open source software by employing source codes and easily accessible parameters from the repository. Moreover, the proposed methods are empirically examined by analyzing 17 open source software projects. According to the empirical results, a meaningful positive correlation is obtained between test effort and success. This implies the importance of preparing test scenarios and codes to obtain successful open source software project."

The results showed that the use of multi-cores in the compression process reduces runtime but leads to an increase in processor temperature.

The proposed model is based on the transmission of small amounts of data representing large amounts of data. By hiding the representative data in the cover image, large data is carried indirectly with very low image distortion rates. This model should be used for the safe transmission of data of high importance and which have been modified at certain times. Small amounts of data hidden in the cover image were used to analyze large amounts of data on the server side. Thus, the principle of imperceptibility, which is one of the basic building blocks of steganography, has been increased. The results showed that the proposed model is safer in the range of about 10% to 40%."

The best combination of filter and algorithms was obtained by first applying a moving average with a window of 115 samples, followed by an M5P algorithm integrated in a Bagging meta-algorithm. Finally, the mean average error, calculated by cross-validation over distances of up to 10 m, was 168 cm, which substantially improves previous experiments focused on similar techniques."

For NAND flash, with the migration from 2D to 3D, is projected to go from today's announced 96 layers to over 500 layers over the next few years. Decreasing the price of conventional memory and increasing the memory capacity, make it hard for emerging memories to replace them. In this situation, where will emerging memories gain a foothold?Among emerging memories, MRAM is very fast, has write and read speeds that are very close to DRAM and has very high endurance. All the major foundries (including TSMC, UMC, Samsung and Global Foundries) have teamed up with MRAM companies to make embedded products using MRAM. There are many other storage and other systems that are using a bit of MRAM to improve overall system performance. MRAM will be particularly useful where power consumption is an issue in loT devices.For PCM, Intel's Optane memory is to be available in DIMM form for populating computer and server memory buses and will be available in 2019. This is supposed to provide improved performance for Intel servers. Besides MRAM and PCM, RRAM could also compete against current memories, such as: split gate, used in embedded applications. The standalone market for memory chips will provide some of the projected volume of emerging memories, but embedded applications, particularly for mobile and Al application, will likely be the big drivers for embedded emerging non-volatile memory. In conclusion, in this talk, we will give an overview of current status and future vision of emerging memory, especially for MRAM, RRAM and PCM."

The introduction of heterostructure into the nanowire provides intentional carrier control within the ststem, showing the possibility for the realization of advanced electronic devices. In this study, we report the results of X - ray diffraction (XRD) and electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) investigation on the structural properties of GaAs - based core - multishell nanowires with GaNAs shell layer prepared by molecular beam epitaxy. The introduction of N into the GaNAs shell showed the peak shift of zinc-blende (ZB) related XRD GaAs (111) peak to the high angle side, indicating the strain deformation of the entire nanowire. In addition, the N introduction reduces the intensity of the wurtzite(WZ)-related GaAs (0002) peak. The phenomenon was further investigated by EBSD. As a result, the WZ structures have smaller diameter than ZB phases, suggesting the transformation of WZ structure to ZB by the introduction of GaNAs shell"

In this talk, we will discuss recent progress on the integration of high-speed (Gb/s) quantum random number generators. We will share recent operation data from a series of units specifically designed using off-the-shelf telecommunication parts. We will then show application-level results in the fields of encryption and computation and finally, we will show recent progress on the use of photonic integrated circuits for the task of high-speed quantum random number generation, showing the scaling potential of quantum and photonic devices in the cyber-security and super-computation spaces."

Interaction with the model facilitates its validation by modelling experts.

In particular, the ~3.67 eV and ~4.0 eV levels were found to be significantly enhanced compared to those in undoped $\\beta$-Ga2O3 substrates and are probably attributable to oxygen vacancies produced by Si doping into $\\beta$-Ga2O3 epitaxial films during the HVPE growth. In addition, the ~3.88 eV level with precipitous photo-capacitance change is likely associated with dislocations and/or surface defects $\\beta$-Ga2O3 homoepitaxial films."

Whereas most research has focused on three-dimensional host materials such as diamond, the van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a robust host for bright, stable, room-temperature quantum emitters (QEs). I will discuss recent experiments that reveal the role of spin for QEs in hBN. Select QEs exhibit striking, anisotropic modulation of emission in response to an applied magnetic field, consistent with optical dynamics featuring a spin-dependent inter-system crossing between singlet and triplet spin states. Many questions persist regarding the chemical and electronic structure of these QEs, which generally exhibit widely heterogeneous optical characteristics, and ongoing work aims to elucidate their formation and stabilization mechanisms. Nonetheless, the discovery of optically addressable spins in room-temperature h-BN ushers in a new platform for spin-based quantum technologies with the potential for atom-scale engineering and versatile functionality."

        "abstract": "Integrated circuit technology has fought against two specific “walls” during the last decade. First it was the “power wall”, followed by the “reliability wall”. Unfortunately, these walls are not independent, resulting in the need for on-line fault detection and correction at minimum cost in power. Duplication and even more triplication of hardware, in other words double- and triple modular redundancy, are heavily used today, since they are robust in terms of fault duration and timing in general, and they work without costly and complex re-design in modules such as embedded processor cores. Alternative methods have been developed, which detect faults by observing signal transitions by the wrong time, specifically for delay faults in logic and radiation-induced faults in flip-flops and registers. There are ways of combining these approaches with a promise for fault detection and correction at minimum cost in power. The tutorial introduces such techniques and shows their limits. Also combinations with more robust techniques are possible for so-called “self-dual” circuits. Finally the aspect of system level error resilience is addressed."

The maximum EQE values was as high as 4% and this value is unexpectedly large, though $h$-BN is an indirect material. This may be caused from the efficient scattering of indirect excitons assisted by phonons (LO(T)/TO(T) for 5.77-eV emission, and LO(T)/TO(T) + 2TO(K) for 5.51-eV emission). Furthermore, such the phonon-assisted scattering processes bring the photo emission energy lower than the fundamental absorption edge energy (~5.8 eV) of $h$-BN, and therefore, the light extraction efficiency can become very high resulting into the high EQE."

In this talk, we will review state-of-the-art deep architectures for inverse problems in imaging. We will compare the data-driven solutions of deep learning with standard iterative methods in terms of performance, speed and practicality. We will discuss adversarial learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and denoising auto-encoders (DAEs) that are used to learn the distribution of the data in the context of inverse problems. We will then provide a unified framework for the application of deep learning to the solution of various inverse problems, including motion deblurring, single image super-resolution, compressive sensing and sparse recovery. The tutorial will finish by summarizing the recent trends in literature to develop general, model-independent solution to inverse problems using novel deep architectures and learning strategies."

        "abstract": "In 2018, Intel published its Loihi neuromorphic research chip and launched the Intel Neuromorphic Research Community (INRC). As an exploratory AI research chip inspired by the principles of neural computation in nature, Loihi explores a very different design regime compared to the Von Neumann and matrix-acceleration architectures in wide use today. Loihi supports sparse and irregular communication between its units, packetized in the form of event-driven “spikes”. Programmable plasticity processes distributed throughout the chip allow Loihi to rapidly adapt and learn in response to stimuli. A novel asynchronous design methodology provides maximal energy efficiency by exploiting the architecture's pervasive sparse activity.Members ofthe INRC are now collaboratively advancing the state-of-the-art in neuromorphic algorithms, software, and applications. Exciting recent results to date suggest that Loihi's combination of fine-grain parallel architecture, its spike-based computational model, and its asynchronous design implementation can provide compelling gains in computing efficiency, scalable to orders of magnitude, for the right kinds of adaptive dynamic problems. These include many exciting applications at the forefront of AI that call for highly efficient real-time interaction with real-world data."

        "abstract": "Since the discovery of graphene, a family of layered materials with nanometer-scale thickness named ‘2D materials’ and their heterostructures have become an invaluable material platform for condensed matter research, providing intriguing properties and functionalities that are missing in their bulk counterparts. Those researches on 2D materials have been mainly done with mechanically-exfoliated nano-thick crystals from ‘top-down’ approach due to its simplicity and wide applicability, while materials under investigation have been limited to cleavable and thermodynamically-stable compounds. We have been developing a growth process of 2D materials based on ‘bottom-up’ molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE), which potentially broadens the scope of materials even to hardly cleavable and thermodynamically-metastable compounds. In this presentation, we will introduce our growth recipe in detail, and present our recent achievements in transport studies including 2D superconductivity and 2D magnetism, as well as development of van der Waals heterostructures exhibiting intriguing interface transport phenomena."

The profile of a bottle microresonator (BMR) often resembles an elongated spheroid or a microscopic bottle. Generally, the shape of a BMR can be quite complex consisting, e.g., of series of coupled BMRs positioned along the fibre. The strong elongation of BMRs enables their several unique properties and applications, which are not possible or much more difficult to realize with other optical microresonators, e.g., those having the shape of a sphere or toroid. First, I will review the BMR theory including their spectral properties, resonant transmission of light through BMRs, and nonlinear BMRs. Next, I will consider the fabrication methods of BMRs. Finally, I will discuss the applications of BMRs for fabrication of miniature delay lines, lasers, and frequency comb generators, optomechanical microdevices, single photon microprocessors, and miniature optical sensors."

To evaluate the LO, the LORI tool is applied with experts in the field and the CUSEOA tool with end users. The results obtained show that the LO has been described as very good quality and that as an educational resource it can be very valuable for achieving the proposed objective."

All samples were processed under a vacuum environment. Firstly, the density of the produced compacts were measured, later on they prepared metallographically and then their mechanical characterization were carried out. Microstructural characterization of the samples were examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Hardness and dry sliding wear tests were applied to the samples to determine their mechanical properties.

It is time to bridge the gaps between the technology, device and system teams. Emerging concepts can only make sense by studying their impact on power and performance at system level. This needs to happen early enough in the development to be able to give feedback on the device specifications, hence the need of system simulators. In particular, STT-MRAM has a lot of potential to reduce energy of cache level, and we'll dive deeper into its impact on HPC and mobile applications. DRAM roadmap and even storage needs also seem to accelerate faster than the device roadmap, we'll also open the discussion around these concepts."

        "abstract": "Performance in several photonics applications such as detection, sensing, light emission and non-linearity enhancement can be substantially improved by electric field enhancement and efficient light funneling into deep subwavelength channels. Phenomena such as structural surface plasmon resonance and extraordinary optical transmission are typically utilized to achieve this. The resonant nature of the phenomenon makes it inherently narrowband restricting its application. Broadband electric field enhancement over a large wavelength range in the mid-infrared (~ 2 – 10 micron) is possible using a double-grooved metallic structure [1] as it operates nonresonantly. We will describe fabrication of the double-groove structure and its optical response when absorptive materials are introduced. The effect of broadband electric field enhancement in the optical response will be discussed.Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.

To avoid the interdiffusion, it turned out that lower growth temperature and/or insertion of the CeO2 buffer layer are/is effective. When the growth temperature is ≤700°C, the 20-nm-thick CeO2 buffer layer is enough to avoid the Si-Er complexes formation, with which the sharp and intense PL emission is achieved."

        "abstract": "Recent technological trends such as Industry 4.0 introduced new challenges that push the limit of current computer and networking architectures. It demands the connection of thousands, if not millions, of sensors and mobile devices coupled with optimized operations to automate various operations inside factories. This led to the new era of Internet of Things (IoTs) where lightweight (possibly mobile) devices are envisaged to send vital information to cloud data centres (mobile and fixed infrastructure) for further processing and decision making. Current cloud computing systems, however, are not able to efficiently digest and process collected information from IoT devices with strict response requests for two main reasons: (1) the round trip delay between IoT devices to the processing engines of cloud could exceed an application's threshold, and (2) network links to cloud resources could be clogged when IoT devices flush data in an uncoordinated fashion. Fog and Edge Computing are two solutions to address both of the previous problems. Though designed to alleviate the same problem, they have fundamental differences that make adopting one more applicable than the other. This talk will overview the practical concerns of today's IoT implementations through tackling the most important obstacles that hinder their adoption. First, production of applicable network (fixed and mobile) latency models to capture all elements of IoT platforms. Second, building a holistic platform to orchestrate various inter-related layers of IoT platforms, including connectivity, big-data analytics, and workload optimization. Third, proposing viable solutions that can be actually implemented in IoT-based applications. More details will be provided about the above issues during the talk."

Ge nanobar catalyst can obtain relatively narrow width of GNR, resulting in the high on/off ratio of GNR-based FET. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements reveal that locally formed fine structures in GNR can be the origin of high on/off. Since this method possesses significant scalability for integrated synthesis of GNR, it can be a promising method for the practical application of GNR, especially in semiconductor device field."

The DC output characteristics can be improved about 20% after the introduction of backside via and copper heat dissipation layer. Moreover, the improvement also can be seen from the load-pull measurements under 20%, 25% and 30% duty cycle. Under higher pulse width operation, the more obvious improvement of output current can be observed. These results indicate that the substrate removal and copper filling technique are effective to achieve high-performance AlGaN/GaN HEMTs."

Fourier-based approaches are not suitable for the nonlinear and nonstationary nature of EEG. For this reason, empirical methods such as multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) are used in the analysis of epileptic EEG signals. This study compares MEMD with Hilbert vibration decomposition method (HVD) in the classification of EEG signals in terms of epileptic status. Frequency and entropy-based attributes were obtained from subcomponents obtained by these two methods and classification was made by convolutional neural network, random forest and support vector machine classifiers. As the result of the study, the HVD method showed higher performance than the MEMD method and reached 100% classification accuracy."

In the process, the influences of the relaxation degree and the current density on the Hall voltage are both considered to obtain the best design. Both the calculated and the 3-D simulation results are obtained. It is shown that the sensitivity is strongly dependent on the width of the fin dimension."

These studies, using data mining (VM) and machine learning techniques, are trying to determine the intrusion detection by examining the log files in different OSI layers. These studies generally use standard data sets and propose hybrid systems to increase the success rate. In this study, an attack detection system (STS) has been developed by using Inonu University web page log files. The log files used as a data set consist of more than 35 million requests and a total of 326 attacks. As a result, the system was trained using artificial neural network (ANN) and attacks were detected with 99.3% success."

In our approach, 2-D InAs nanosheets can be obtained directly from 1-D InAs nanowires by silver-indium alloy segregation, which is much easier than all previously reported method, such as traditional buffering technique and select area epitaxial growth. Detailed transmission electron microscopy investigations provide a solid evidence that the catalyst alloy segregation is the origination of the InAs dimensional transformation from 1-D nanowires to 2-D nanosheets, and even to three-dimensional complex crosses. Using this method, we find that the wafer-scale free-standing InAs nanosheets can be grown on various substrates including Si, MgO, sapphire and GaAs etc. The InAs nanosheets grown at high temperature are pure phase single crystals. Our work will open up a conceptually new and general technology route toward the effective controlling the dimension of the low-dimensional III-V semiconductors. It may also enable the low-cost fabrication of free-standing nanosheet-based devices on an industrial scale."

Liquid crystallinity helps us to control molecular alignments and fabricate uniform crystalline films by solution process. Our developed OTFT material, phenyl-benzothienobenzothiophene derivative, Ph-BTBT-10, shows good transistor performance after thermal annealing. Furthermore, the variation of transistor performance is quite small, and the standard deviation divided by average is less than 10%. I conclude that the best use of liquid crystallinity in OTFT materials is the key for practical applications of OTFTs."
