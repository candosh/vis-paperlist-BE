Using our own packaging technology of double-sided cooling and SiC devices, we have developed the new, small 6-in-1 power module with high output power density. If the inductance of the main circuit is large, it will cause a large surge voltage when switched. Therefore, we have incorporated the optimum low inductance structure into this module, and have made it possible to drive the SiC device at high speed. Using this module, we have built a prototype of inverter unit with 75 kW output power, and have achieved an efficiency of 99% and a power density of 100 kW/L."

This paper investigates the current methodologies for MTDC control stating their limitations for severe contingency conditions and proposes a control strategy able to ensure grid reliability and voltage stability in the case of a sudden outage of the converter station controlled in Vdc-Q. This strategy, acting on the Vdc reference signal, allows the presence of multiple master converters in the DC grid. A five-terminal DC scheme, which connects onshore AC systems with offshore wind farms, has been developed in RT-Lab Simulator. Each sub-station (terminal) is equipped with a modular multilevel converter (MMC). The converters are either Vdc-Q controlled (master stations) or are P-Q (with droop control) or Vac-frequency regulated. The dynamic response of the system is observed after a converter outage to assess the validity of the proposed DC voltage control strategy."

To address this issue, a systematic approach has been suggested in this paper to compensate for the network latency in the application of synchrophasor assisted wide area control for the Static Var Compensator (SVC). The power oscillation modes are estimated online in presence of packet drop in a communication network. The modes are monitored through a modified Modified Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) approach. The time delay has been compensated by predicting the dynamics of the delayed measurement signal. A network control system model has been developed incorporating the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), event driven communication network and network buffers to mimic the response of a real time communication based control. The wide-area stabilizing controller has been designed based on Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy approach. The performance of the proposed delay compensation scheme has been tested on 39-bus New England system."

In this paper the economic operation of SSEZs is formulated and solved as an optimization problem. A probabilistic model for Small Scale Energy Resources (SSERs) and load demand is used at each SSEZs to determine the optimal scheduling of microgrids with minimum operating cost. The power transaction between MGs and between MGs and the main is regulated based on the total operating cost and regarding the sold or purchase power either by microgrids or by main grid. The stochastically analysis of generated power with SSERs and their corresponding costs is determined considering optimization constraints and explained as PDF and CDF. The Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm are applied to comparative study of the results as optimization algorithms. Based on the results, it is possible to determine the power demand and transaction between each SSEZs and the main grid. Besides, the results confirm that the power sharing between microgrids and main grid can decrease the operating cost of the smart distribution grids."

When voltage sag occurs due to grid side fault, the series compensator of the UPQC injects required voltage to prevent disconnecting of FSIG wind turbine. On the other hand, faults produced by wind turbine generator systems will impact not only the wind farms but also the interconnected system including the grid if proper protection is not ensured. Therefore, the resistive SFCL incorporated in series with the dc-link inductance of UPQC is proposed to limit excessive current in the event of the generator side fault. Detailed simulation studies implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC confirm that both of resistive SFCL and large dc-link inductance are effective in decreasing the fault current thereby reducing the voltage dip at the generator terminal."

        "abstract": "In a microgrid (MG) with high penetration of single phase induction motors (SPIMs), the voltage recovery process after a fault-induced islanding can be very slow. The reason lies in the stall of SPIMs caused by low voltage. During stalling, a SPIM can withdraw as high as three times of its rated power. This phenomenon can cause many problems including the loss of critical load due to the action of protection devices. This paper explores the role of reactive power support during MG islanding and proposes a novel approach to managing the reactive power generation of electronic-interfaced distributed generators (EIDGs). The concept of sensitivity factors is used in the proposed algorithm for regulating voltages at weak load buses. The optimal sharing of reactive power among EIDGs is formulated as a linear programming problem, which can be solved in a very fast manner for real-time control purpose. The proposed method is validated on a MG test-bed evolved from the IEEE standard 13-bus test feeder."

To enhance energy conversion efficiency, bypass diodes have been used in PV systems. The usage of bypass diodes is particularly effective when a PV system is under an uneven shading condition. However, shading is normally applied to a PV array in very random manners, making shading analysis and improvement contributed by the bypass diodes extremely hard to access. This paper performs a comprehensive study on the PV array energy extraction characteristics under a variety of shading conditions. Based on the study, an enhanced bypass diode design in terms of doping concentration is proposed. Investigation of the proposed bypass diode scheme shows that such bypass diode design is effective in improving energy capture efficiency under diverse shading conditions. Significant simulation studies are conducted for detailed evaluation of a PV system with the different bypass diode schemes and process."

A data communication system is a chain of components stretching from a data source to its destination. Like a chain, each component must accomplish its assigned tasks adequately. Nevertheless, this novel technology has introduced new groups of failures that are conceptually different from those of traditional power networks. Power system reliability studies must consider the failure modes and repair strategies of the cyber network. This paper investigates cyber-power network failures and proposes a novel, all-inclusive categorization of failures that have the potential to threaten the power system's proper operation.

Bejeweled has been ported to many different platforms and influenced an incredible number of similar games. Very recently one of them, named Candy Crush Saga enjoyed a huge popularity and quickly went viral on social networks. We generalize this kind of games by only parameterizing the size of the board, while all the other elements (such as the rules or the number of gems) remain unchanged. Then, we prove that answering many natural questions regarding such games is actually NP-Hard. These questions include determining if the player can reach a certain score, play for a certain number of turns, and others.

The numerical results of the bit error rates indicate that the polarization rotating wave improve communication quality in multipath environment without line-of-sight waves."

Determining condition or health requires considerable investments. This report investigates whether visual inspection and age are sufficient parameters for estimating the remaining life of this asset. The simple visual and age assessment is quantified by means of Health Indexing. The effectiveness of this simple assessment is measured by comparing it to a condition evaluation that is based on detailed, quantitative laboratory testing. The use of life curves for different geographical regions facilitates the process of determining remaining life. Estimated lives based on the simple and more comprehensive assessments, as well as based on chronological age are compared for different geographical regions."

Microgrid technologies have the potential to address some of the challenges associated with improving the resiliency of the nations electrical infrastructure. Microgrids are not a new concept but advances in device capabilities, computing capabilities, and communications are making them a more attractive option. This panel discussion will cover the concept of using microgrids as a resiliency resource and examine work that is being done by the United States Department of Energy."

But in transient, inverters have unbalanced power sharing and consequently circulating current flows between them. This current without feeding load flows and causes losses. In this paper for eliminating these problems, a new method based on conventional droop method is presented. This new method uses absolute value of current signal only and replacing LPF by a DC Mean Block. To compare two methods, a system with two parallel inverters is simulated in MATLAB. Comparison between Results of two methods shows effectiveness of proposed method in improvement of VSIs' behavior in transient response."

Based on several commonly existed lightning transformations, perform technical and economic analysis first to obtain the primary choice. Then, theoretical lightning protection measure is selected by comprehensively considering constrained factors according to the IAHP weights. Thereby, examine whether the transformation works by calculating the shielding failure rate through the establishment of EGM model, thus the optimal method is confirmed finally. The application of the method is illustrated by using a typical 500 kV transmission line under complex terrain, and the expected evaluation results have shown that the proposed protection performance can meet the transformation requirements well and guide engineering practice effectively."

As a result, the use of alternative sources such as wind and solar energy is in rapid growth world-wide. Nowadays these renewable energies are always combined with energy storage systems (ESSs) to save extra energy production and keep the production level below a specific limit. An ESS could also be combined with a STATCOM in a power system. This combination could add the benefits of an ESS to the advantages of a FACTS device such as reduced power flows on overloaded lines, resulting in increased system loadability, lower transmission line losses, improved power system stability and security, lower power production costs, and more secure bus voltage levels. This paper presents a genetic algorithm-based optimization process, for seeking optimal locations and parameters for a STATCOM combined with an ESS in power systems. The optimization process is designed to minimize transmission line losses and maximize the power transmitted by the network. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed optimization process in determining optimal locations for the device in several test networks."

Due to multimedia content and mobile access, network traffic becomes more intensive, and network management more complex. A new paradigm, Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables network administrators to decouple control plane from data plane, and logically centralize control functions in a software controller. This paper describes SDN architecture and Mininet simulation environment for rapid SDN prototyping. A simple example of a real network is used to demonstrate programming of SDN controllers."

Primary predefined reserve, which is deployed in order to maintain frequency deviations within allowed bands, can lead to an increase in operation cost of system, due to the need for committing more generation units. Participation of electrical vehicles in electricity market can be utilized as a means of reducing operation costs. A model to integrate EVs participation in energy and reserve market is presented. The model takes frequency regulation constraints into consideration. The results indicate that the system/market operators can utilize EVs to reduce operation cost while frequency constraints are respected."

Our methodology makes use of a widely studied second order cone relaxation applied to the branch flow model of a radial network. Several types of conditions have been established under which this relaxation is exact and we focus here on the situations where this is not the case. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to add increasingly tight linear cuts to the second-order cone problem until a physically meaningful solution is obtained. We apply this technique to a sample system taken from the literature and compare the results with a traditional nonlinear solver."

In the initial levels of the smart grids implementation reduced amounts of data are generated, namely consumption data. The methodology proposed in the present paper makes use of demand response consumers' performance evaluation methods to determine the expected consumption for a given consumer. Then, potential commercial losses are identified using monthly historic consumption data. Real consumption data is used in the case study to demonstrate the application of the proposed method."

A complex system interacts with its surrounding which executes many set of tasks by maintaining its performance. Any change in a system other than its acceptable performance or anything which is not tolerable is treated as a fault. So fault detection and diagnosis becomes necessary in system or component malfunction and thus decreasing the downtime of the system. Fault diagnosis includes necessary facts that are used to identify the faults encountered in the process. Various models have developed to map the hierarchical system-level fault diagnostic information consisting of causal dependencies between observable symptoms and failure modes that are associated with a system. In this paper, various areas are discussed that are involved in fault diagnosis and detection model related to the automobile domain. This survey mainly concentrate on which source is better for constructing fault diagnosis model. Text driven model is found to be reliable for creating D-matrix model to maintain accuracy."

By using wide bandgap semiconductor such as SiC, the unipolar devices are available in the power device application area over 600V while silicon requires the bipolar devices such as pn junction or IGBT. The unipolar devices of Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) and MOSFETs realize the fast switching and resulting lower switching losses due to quite less stored charges. Mass production of SiC-MOSFET and Full SiC Power Module has finally started in 2010 and 2012, respectively. New era of power electronics has been just opened by SiC power devices."

An improved morphological filter with good performance in suppressing noise is designed in which the least mean square (LMS) arithmetic is adopted to calculate the weight coefficients of open-closing and close-opening filter adaptively. Then, according to the theory of grille fractal, voltage sag signals could be located exactly and the phase variation could be detected by analyzing the change of the grille. The simulation and actual application results show that the proposed method is effective and valid. Moreover, the grill number can be applied as an auxiliary measure for the detection of different disturbances of voltage sags and compensation strategy to improve the power quality."

Moving their businesses and data to a new platform yet has some challenges to overcome, such as safety, integrity, reliability and scalability. Most of the companies offering cloud solutions claim to have overcome many obstacles and provide a fully robust infrastructure, but these claims are yet to be proven with real case studies and software engineering approaches. In this paper we will provide real data measurements, obtained from load and performance testing of both infrastructures, that will present a good comparison between Server and Cloud platforms when providing the same service to the end users. We have chosen an adequate application, a university social network, which can provide a good estimation of the scalability of the Cloud vs. Server infrastructure. This case study has not only proven that some of the claims made so far are right but it has also raised several other questions in terms of investments costs, reliability and future implementations approaches."

PSRA calculates the probability or likelihood of each undesirable event in the transmission system and evaluates the corresponding severity. In PSRA, the probability measure of each undesirable event is combined with the consequence measure into a single reliability index-Probabilistic Loss of Load Index. When power system is insecure, optimal generation re-dispatch is implemented to ensure the system goes back to the secure region. Under emergency conditions, when generation re-dispatch alone is not enough, load shedding will be enforced to bring the system back to the security region. Weak point analysis is developed and used to identify the buses and branches that are most vulnerable. Online implementation of PSRA is also discussed and it is concluded that the proposed probabilistic reliability analysis is much more accurate than traditional methods and it provides system operators the capability to make faster trade-off decisions between economy and technical constraints."

While the impediments to the development of a standard analog fault model are obvious, the procedures to create such a model have never been elucidated, always left as future work to be done later. Well, the future is now. The presentation, with audience participation, seeks to outline possible procedures to solve this problem defined in the past yet still continuing to affect current and future technologies."

Our results reveal that Vgmax stress results in larger threshold voltage shift due to the higher interface state generation at channel and accumulation regions, linking to NBTI effect.

And we establish the affine nonlinear control model of analogy X20, which is proved the input-output linearization. On the basis, we design the feedback linearization control law. When there being the uncertainties of aero density, aerodynamic moment coefficients and inertia, the simulations are performed for the original dynamics, which include the earth rotation and whose aerodynamic data come from the aerodynamic data table directly. The simulation results indicate that the resulting control law ensures the control targets and has strong robustness."

Using the communication infrastructure and management that created in smart grids, end-user reactive power capable device can be coordinated for voltage support. Application and implementation of smart grids cause a fundamental change in the methods of reducing and eliminating voltage issues in distribution grids. Due to increasing role of Distributed Generations in distribution grids, by using traditional control methods, voltage issues cannot be improved desirably. In this paper a decentralized control scheme is proposed to control voltage in distribution grids. In this decentralized method, each network bus is equipped with a sensor and an oscillator to measure required parameters. It is shown that by using local coupling method, one can design the network without the need for a central controller. Genetic Algorithm is used as optimization method aimed at identifying the optimal asset of the voltage controllers. To verify the method, it is applied on the IEEE 33- bus system (unbalanced case)."

The modified Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) has been issued to solve the model based on the target, the lowest totally economic cost. The results of the simulation on typical micro-grid show that the model is suitable to solve micro-grid parallel running, and more important, the CO2 Emissions Trade can significantly improve the economics of micro-grid."

From operations point of view, reliance on these static figures leads to underutilization and limited options to re-route power flow during normal and emergency conditions. The framework proposed in this article formalizes the engineering practice of overloading that helps optimize feeder utilization based on dynamic ratings as — preferably — an integral function of a substation-based thermal overload monitoring and prediction system. Such a system leverages real-time data from intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) and sensors in the age of anticipated data deluge. The ultimate goal is to empower operators with tools and intelligence that allows them to take advantage of capacity margins in a calculated manner in the midst of ever-increasing dynamics and variability in generation and consumption."

This study develops novel methods for feeder fault location with current/voltage sensors sparsely deployed in the network. The voltages and currents measured in the substation and sensors are utilized in this study. Depending on the available sensor locations relative to fault, such as both upstream/downstream or upstream only, and the lateral conditions, the algorithm searches every possible path and calculates the fault distance and fault resistance. Eight scenarios are identified for all possible situations. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments are performed to verify the proposed methods. High fault location accuracy has been achieved in various network and fault conditions."

However, in case of switched reluctance motor (SRM), the non-linearity and double saliency of the motor make the modelling and controller design challenging. This paper attempts linearisation of the flux linkage characteristic of the SRM at different operating points. The models include saturation and back-emf in an effective manner, as compared to existing methods. The different linearised models are evaluated for the purpose of current controller design. An effective method of controller design is found which directly relates the machine parameters to the controller gains."

However, one of the most important facets of such problems is their intermittent nature, which means that the operation and management of a power system is a difficult task. In this paper, a probabilistic approach to solving the economic dispatch (ED) problem under conditions of uncertainty is presented. The proposed methodology allows for obtaining the probability distribution function (PDF) of all generation units, the energy not supplied (ENS) and the total generation cost. A case study based on an insular power system is analyzed, with reference to the important relationship that exists between the PDF of net load demand and the PDF of ENS, power production and total generation cost."

        "abstract": "It remains a challenge to simultaneously remove geometric distortion and space-time-varying blur in frames a captured through a turbulent atmospheric medium. We propose a new scheme to recover a latent image from observed frames by integrating a new variational model and distortion-driven spatial-temporal kernel regression. First, the proposed scheme constructs a high-quality reference image from the observed frames using low-rank decomposition. Then, to generate an improved registered sequence, the reference image is iteratively optimized using a variational model containing a new spatial-temporal regularization. The proposed fast algorithm solves this model without the use of partial differential equations (PDEs). Next, to reduce blur variation, distortion-driven spatial-temporal kernel regression is carried out to fuse the registered sequence into one image by introducing the concept of the near-stationary patch. Applying a blind deconvolution algorithm to the fused image produces the output. Extensive experimental testing shows, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that the proposed method can effectively alleviate distortion and blur and recover details of the original scene compared to state-of-the-art methods."

        "abstract": "The technology of wireless power transfer has been around for over 100 years, and has been applied in various industries. In the automotive industry, wireless charging has been effectively applied to electric and hybrid vehicles. The present reliance on personal mobile devices has opened up a quickly expanding desire for wireless power transfer to eliminate charge cords and the associated charging adaptors necessary to keep our phones charged. Wireless charging of cell phones in the vehicle is not only a safety issue by eliminating the distraction of fumbling for charge cords while driving, but also a customer driven convenience similar to the convenience offered for vehicle charging. This movement of applying wireless power transfer has many additional applications in both the automotive and consumer industries. With technology developments, it is expected that wireless power transfer may effectively be applied in vehicles to power devices, sensors, control modules, and illumination eliminating wiring and connections. Stretching our imaginations, it may eventually lead to non-contact connection systems. As with other industry wide technologies, wireless power transfer will be driven by standards. Multiple standards organizations are presently competing for their positions, and will be a major significance to wide scale implementation."

On the other hand C is often a burden for students in the first year, as they have many difficulties in writing their own programs and the failure rates of course examinations are typically high. We have investigated different approaches at our facility in the last years, how to enhance the students' capabilities in C programming and how to lower the failure rate of the C-programming course. Several concepts involved are: visualization of control and data flow, game programming and automated assessment tools with plagiarism detection. We have integrated some of these concepts into the programming environment Virtual-C IDE. This paper discusses the educational benefits of using the Virtual-C IDE for lectures, self-learning and as a platform for programming assignments and reports our first practical experiences."

        "abstract": "Duty cycling control (DCC) of air conditioning can bring significant peak clipping and energy saving benefits for city power grids. Being small scattered loads with different thermal comfort requirements, residential air conditioners (RACs) need grouping and grading DCC. Hence, after deriving the room temperature equations, this paper suggests a RAC grouping method based on the two indices of room characteristic temperature (RCT) and temperature change index (TCI). An energy saving maximization model is further presented for optimizing the grading DCC strategies of the grouped RACs, producing three duty cycles corresponding to three levels of thermal comfort. Results of a case study on a low-carbon residential quarter in Chongming District, Shanghai show that if not violating the residents' willingness, the RACs shall be assigned to the DCC grade of the smallest duty cycle so that greater energy saving effect can be achieved. However, RACs with high RCTs and TCIs might only be able to participate in the grades of large duty cycles for catering their thermal comfort requirement. With small single-point benefit though, DCC on RACs can produce significant energy saving and peak clipping effect if applied in large scale."

That is a great drawback to some high dynamic carrier especially to some high-speed guided weapons. The paper proposed an acquisition algorithm aided by inertia information under high dynamic environment. Here the real-time speed and position of carrier is estimated by the inertial information and the doppler shift is estimated by ephemeris combined with inertial information. The algorithm can decrease range of frequency, reduce the search time and increase the acquisition speed. The semi-physical simulation experiment was performed to test the acquision performance of receiver that work at static state and high dynamic environment and it proves that algorithm can increase the acquisition speed."

As the construction of RIF™ insulation would delay the propagation of a core insulation breakdown after the onset of an initial insulation defect, this type of real time monitoring of core insulation condition provides a novel tool to manage bushing defects without any sense of urgency. It offers, for the first time, a very early field detection tool for transformer bushing insulation faults and by way of consequence, a much improved protection of power transformers over their operating life."

When opening and closing instruction are entered in the GCB, the solenoid pushes the trigger, and mechanisms move so as to release the compression force of the spring at a high speed. A compact and light-weight mechanism is required for high-speed operation of the GCB. This means that the high-speed operation must be analytically investigated. We made a mechanical dynamics model of the whole GCB, including an FEM modal analysis. The dynamic simulator incorporates a solenoid electromagnetic field analysis and a gas pressure analysis of puffer chamber in the mechanical dynamics model. The operating characteristics of the GCB were analyzed with the simulator and measured in an operating experiment. The analytical results were in good agreement with the experimental results, and this proved that the simulator can be used to estimate the operating characteristics and appraise the stability of operation. The dynamics simulator can shorten the time it takes to design compact and light-weight GCB."

        "abstract": "As the design rule of BEOL of the device decreases, it becomes difficult to obtain void-free Cu fill with the conventional PVD barrier metal (TaN/Ta). To increase Cu gap-fill performance, CVD liners such as Co and Ru have been extensively developed. Among them, Ru liner has a great potential for the next generation Cu interconnect technology because it can provide Cu reflow process. However, Ru is one of the famous noble metals, which means that Ru CMP becomes a very challenging and key technology in BEOL technology. In this presentation, the characteristics of Cu/low-k CMP with Ru liner will be discussed in terms of planarity, uniformity and defects. Especially, dishing and erosion behavior including the pattern density and pitch dependency on CMP slurry and conditions will be focused. Electric results from successfully integrated Cu interconnects with Ru will be also presented."

In this case we present a solution for calculating the path length, which can be used for navigation techniques used in mobile robotics. The KF algorithm has been implemented and run on an Altera Ciclone II FPGA with a Nios II processor. To achieve this, first of all we had to do the modeling of our mobile system applying concepts of odometry, considering the readings of the encoders on our mobile platform Pioneer 3AT (P3AT). Then we proceeded to develop the probabilistic algorithm of the Kalman Filter from our system model using as additional measure the information of path length provided by the internal robot system. This probabilistic algorithm is based on the concept of sensor fusion, allowing us to get the better estimate of the value of the path length. At the end, we show a comparison of the algorithm performance developed in software and hardware independently."

The modeling result reveals that during language acquisition, children have the ability to utilize acoustic (spectrogram) features to acquire vowel categories and categories of different manners of articulation, and build acoustic space relations among different vowels."

We first show the complexity and issues diagnosing this failure and then cover the basic diagnosis steps localizing the defect starting from DFD (Design-For-Debug), test vector generation to screen the defect and failure analysis. A solution to avoid these type of failures is also discussed."

Fundamentally, imaging in the form of computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (U/S), mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and fluoroscopy among others guides all treatment decision making. No sites of disease are these tools perhaps more necessary than in the radiation treatment of lung cancer. Thoracic malignancies are more than likely found in advanced, disseminated states as a consequence of the late symptoms manifested by the tumor's anatomic locations. As such, non-invasive imaging is critical to diagnosis, defining the extent of disease, and helping demarcate tumor from normal tissue structures as part of radiation treatment planning. Image guidance is also manifest to accuracy of radiation delivery and helps clinical teams identify how successfully therapy is delivered. This talk will summarize the use of imaging and image guidance in radiation treatment of lung cancers."
