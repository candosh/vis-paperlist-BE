The metadata provided with each image enables reasoning about location, time, sun angles, physical sizes, and other features when making predictions about objects in the image. Our dataset consists of over 1 million images from over 200 countries. For each image, we provide at least one bounding box annotation containing one of 63 categories, including a \"false detection\" category. We present an analysis of the dataset along with baseline approaches that reason about metadata and temporal views. Our data, code, and pretrained models have been made publicly available."

        "abstract": "Regression testing is crucial but can be extremely costly. Regression Test Selection (RTS) aims to reduce regression testing cost by only selecting and running the tests that may be affected by code changes. To date, various RTS techniques analyzing at different granularities (e.g., at the basic-block, method, and file levels) have been proposed. RTS techniques working on finer granularities may be more precise in selecting tests, while techniques working on coarser granularities may have lower overhead. According to a recent study, RTS at the file level (FRTS) can have less overall testing time compared with a finer grained technique at the method level, and represents state-of-the-art RTS. In this paper, we present the first hybrid RTS approach, HyRTS, that analyzes at multiple granularities to combine the strengths of traditional RTS techniques at different granularities. We implemented the basic HyRTS technique by combining the method and file granularity RTS. The experimental results on 2707 revisions of 32 projects, totalling over 124 Million LoC, demonstrate that HyRTS outperforms state-of-the-art FRTS significantly in terms of selected test ratio and the offline testing time. We also studied the impacts of each type of method-level changes, and further designed two new HyRTS variants based on the study results. Our additional experiments show that transforming instance method additions/deletions into file-level changes produces an even more effective HyRTS variant that can significantly outperform FRTS in both offline and online testing time."

There are no full nodes or lightweight nodes, all nodes are equal and contributing to the Section-Blockchain network. Experiments demonstrate that Section-Blockchain is efficient, remarkably reduced the storage, and withstand sudden nodes losing of massive scale. Section-blockchain also extended the capability of blockchain to the foundation of an autotrophic, tamper-resist decentralized storage system, in which, data can be equidistributional distributed worldwide automatically without any centralized dispatcher to assign storage; nodes are motivated to change their local storage to receive more remuneration. The global storage distribution is continuously optimizing and fit into any adding/losing nodes."

Unfortunately, this mechanism has downsides: When the number of forks becomes large, it is difficult for developers to get or maintain an overview of activities in the forks. Current tools provide little help. We introduce INFOX, an approach to automatically identify non-merged features in forks and to generate an overview of active forks in a project. The approach clusters cohesive code fragments using code and network-analysis techniques and uses information-retrieval techniques to label clusters with keywords. The clustering is effective, with 90% accuracy on a set of known features. In addition, a human-subject evaluation shows that INFOX can provide actionable insight for developers of forks."

While CI environments provide advantages, they also utilize non-trivial amounts of time and resources. To address this issue, researchers have adapted techniques for test case prioritization (TCP) to CI environments. To date, however, the techniques considered have operated on test suites, and have not achieved substantial improvements. Moreover, they can be inappropriate to apply when system build costs are high. In this work we explore an alternative: prioritization of commits. We use a lightweight approach based on test suite failure and execution history that is highly effcient; our approach \"continuously\" prioritizes commits that are waiting for execution in response to the arrival of each new commit and the completion of each previously scheduled commit. We have evaluated our approach on three non-trivial CI data sets. Our results show that our approach can be more effective than prior techniques."

These startups operate in a dynamic environment, with significant time and market pressure, and rarely have time for systematic requirements analysis. Our theory describes the evolution of practice along six dimensions that emerged as relevant to their requirements activities: requirements artefacts, knowledge management, requirements-related roles, planning, technical debt and product quality. Beyond the relationships among the dimensions, our theory also explains the turning points that drove the evolution along these dimensions. These changes are reactive, rather than planned, suggesting an overall pragmatic lightness, i.e., flexibility, in the startups' evolution towards engineering practices for requirements. Our theory organises knowledge about evolving requirements practice in maturing startups, and provides practical insights for startups' assessing their own evolution as they face challenges to their growth. Our research also suggests that a startup's evolution along the six dimensions is not fundamental to its success, but has significant effects on their product, their employees and the company."

We developed a new algorithm QuickSampler which requires a small number of solver calls to produce millions of samples which satisfy the constraints with high probability. We evaluate QuickSampler on large real-world benchmarks and show that it can produce unique valid solutions orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art sampling tools, with a distribution which is reasonably close to uniform in practice."

The characteristics of online social networks enable cyberbullies to access places and countries that were previously unattainable. In this study; the use of natural language processing techniques and machine learning methods namely, Bayesian logistic regression, random forest algorithm, multilayer sensor, J48 algorithm and support vector machines have been used to determine cyber bullying.

To understand what's missing from C++ API documentation and the factors influencing whether it will be fixed, we conducted a mixed-methods study involving two experience sampling surveys with hundreds of developers at the moment they visited implementation code, interviews with 18 of those developers, and interviews with 8 API maintainers. In many cases, updating documentation may provide only limited value for developers, while requiring effort maintainers don't want to invest. We identify a set of questions maintainers and tool developers should consider when improving API-level documentation."

In particular, we use the K-means algorithm with multiple random starting points, in order to find several solutions to the same problem. This algorithm considers the data of the Italian calls for tenders, extracted through a crawling technique, and optimized through the proposed approach to obtain multiple solutions. These are used to achieve a repository of products that can be easily displayed and inquired during the formulation of an offer from a bidder company willing to participate to a call for tenders.

In order to satisfy performance, security, reliability and other quality concerns, architects need to compare and carefully choose a combination of architectural patterns, styles or tactics. Then later in the development cycle, these architectural choices must be implemented completely and correctly so there will not be any drift from envisioned design. In this paper, we use data analytics-based techniques to study five large-scale software systems, examining the impact and the role of software architects who write code on software quality. Our quantitative study is augmented with a follow-up interview of architects. This paper provides empirical evidence for supporting the pragmatic opinions that architects should write code. Our analysis shows that implementing architectural tactics is more complex than delivering functionality, tactics are more error prone than software functionalities, and the architects tend to introduce fewer bugs into the implementation of architectural tactics compared to the developers."

To analyze such opinionated reviews, the proposed system presents a linguistic approach to opinion mining. This system analyzes hotel user reviews written in Myanmar language and performs the opinion mining tasks at the aspect level. Finally, the system classifies the aspects/features contained in the reviews as positive, negative or neutral. The important task of aspect level opinion mining is identifying the relations between aspects and opinion words in the reviews. This detection is a big challenge because of informal writing styles of reviews. Especially, it is a difficult task of aspect level opinion mining on Myanmar reviews due to the nature of Myanmar language. Therefore, the proposed system mainly focuses on extracting the relevant pairs of aspects and opinion words from the user reviews using the syntactic patterns and some linguistic rules."

Developers establish links between tasks to express implicit dependencies that needs explicit handling–-dependencies that often require the developers responsible for a given task to assess how changes in a linked task affect their own work and vice versa (i.e., change propagation). While seemingly useful, it is unknown if change propagation indeed coincides with task links. No study has investigated to what extent change propagation actually occurs between task pairs and whether it is able to serve as a metric for characterizing the underlying task dependency. In this paper, we study the temporal relationship between developer reading and changing of source code in relationship to task links. We identify seven situations that explain the varying correlation of change propagation with linked task pairs and find six motifs describing when change propagation occurs between non-linked task pairs. Our paper demonstrates that task links are indeed useful for recommending which artifacts to monitor for changes, which developers to involve in a task, or which tasks to inspect."

However, fairness problems occur if multiple pedestrians with incongruent needs wish to use the same object simultaneously. This research proposes a method for establishing a fair configuration of smart urban objects that are used by multiple pedestrians at the same time. Therefore, I develop an adaption rule based on economic fairness models to establish a welfare-egalitarian configuration of smart urban objects for the case of two concurrent users. The simulation-based evaluation provides evidence that using the adaption rule both enhances fairness and utilitarian welfare compared to using non-adaption."

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm, a hybrid feature is used to characterize the virtual reality scene so that the stereoscopic parallax generation process can be completed quickly.

        "abstract": "Presently, the delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm, also known as the backprojection algorithm, is the most popular way to reconstruct impulse based forward-looking ground penetrating radar (FLGPR) images. Nevertheless, it is widely known that the DAS algorithm has poor clutter rejection capability and generates FLGPR images with low resolution. The advantage of the DAS algorithm is its computational speed and ability to reconstruct scatterers within a scene-of-interest that are sufficiently spaced. In this paper, we propose a deblurring algorithm that is based on a model for DAS images whereby the known system matrix depends on the transmitted signal, and the propagation delays associated with the transmitted and backscattered signals. Using a DAS image as the data, an improved FLGPR image is obtained by estimating the true reflection coefficients via a popular estimation method known as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The objective function that results from LASSO is minimized using the majorization-minimization optimization technique. We refer to the proposed algorithm as the deblurring DAS (D-DAS) algorithm. Using synthetic data, we provide subjective results where the D-DAS algorithm significantly outperformed the standard DAS algorithm."

Based on the cavity model for a square MPA, the TM10 and TM30 modes as well as both higher odd- and even-order modes between them are characterized. In order to combine the dual modes for wide-bandwidth radiation and stable radiation patterns, the differential-fed MPA with a SIR-typed radiating patch is employed firstly to reallocate the dual modes closely to each other. Then, the bandwidth, profile, dimensions, and sidelobe of the MPA under multi-mode resonance are improved through adding the shorting pins, introducing the shorting wall, and etching the narrow slots. As a result, a low-profile wideband MPA is realized with several attractive performance, such as decreased length, reduced sidelobe level, and stable radiation patterns. Finally, these proposed wide-bandwidth MPA under radiation of multi-resonant modes are proposed, designed, and fabricated to provide an experimental verification on the operating principle of the antenna."

The concept of DevOps has come to reduce the separation between development and operations teams in software development companies, decreasing the product lifecycle. With this concept comes the practice of continuous delivery, allowing teams to deliver and deploy any version of their software in any computing environment at any time through a fully automated process. This practice improves the feedback of the development process, so problems could be identified and resolved as early as possible. In this paper, we present an experience of deploying DevOps, and propose a structured process for deploying DevOps and its modifications necessary to adapt to legacy systems in order to the delivery process of the legacy systems has a short and high quality lifecycle, delivering frequent versions in an automated way."

        "abstract": "Clustering is used to partition genomic data into disjoint subsets to streamline further processing. Since inputs can contain billions of nucleotides, performance is paramount. Consequently, clustering software is typically developed as a tightly coupled monolithic system which hinders software reusability, extensibility and introduction of new algorithms as well as data structures. Having experienced similar issues in our own clustering software, we have developed a flexible and extensible parallel framework called PEACE. The objective of the framework is to ease design, implementation, and use of various clustering methods without compromising performance. This paper presents the PEACE framework, its software architecture, parallel infrastructure, and distributed data structures along with a case study of developing a clustering algorithm. Case studies of developing filters, heuristics, and comparison algorithms are also discussed to illustrate modularity and extensibility of PEACE which enables software reuse in unique ways that may not have been foreseen when individual components were developed."

This process leads to the division of space due to the forms of its coverage and associated human activities. Very often changes in land cover are related to the intensification of the processes of anthropisation of the natural environment. The main purpose of this article is to present tools for measuring the direction of changes in land cover, taking into account the impact of these changes on the quality of the natural environment. The author identifies the coverage of the area with the type of human activity and the natural value of this area. Based on this assumption, by using the CORIN Land Cover data, the article presents an assessment of the directions and intensity of environmental changes in the area of the province of Warmia and Mazury."

        "abstract": "The use of mobile apps is increasingly widespread, and much effort is put into testing these apps to make sure they behave as intended. To reduce this effort, and thus the cost of mobile app testing, we propose AppTestMigrator, a technique that allows for migrating test cases between apps with similar features. The intuition behind AppTestMigrator is that many apps share similarities in their functionality, and these similarities often result in conceptually similar user interfaces (through which that functionality is accessed). Typical examples of this situation are apps in the same category, apps developed based on the same specification, and different versions of the same app. In all these cases, the burden of writing test cases can be reduced by migrating test cases written for an app to another, similar app. Given a test case for an app (source app) and a second app (target app), AppTestMigrator attempts to automatically transform the sequence of events in the test for the source app to events that can be consumed by the target app. We implemented AppTestMigrator for Android mobile apps and evaluated our approach on four randomly selected shopping list apps from the Google Play Store. Our initial results are promising and motivate further research in this direction."

In this paper, we propose a framework that strongly simplifies such updates: DevOps teams just specify the desired target architecture for their microservice application, instead of specifying how to reach it. In addition, updates managed with our framework can conform to various SLA requirements and resist to failures."

This approach is capable of highlighting the performance cause, using a comparative methodology on slow and fast execution runs. We applied the solution on some use cases and were able to find the specific cause of issues. Furthermore, we implemented the solution in a framework to help developers working with similar problems."

Starting 2018, PATMOS will be collocated with two complementary conferences, IOLTS and IVSW, forming FEDfRo, the federative event on Design for Robustness. The traditional scope of PATMOS has mainly been about the design of circuits and architectures optimized for highest performance at lowest power consumption. But meanwhile, power-efficiency has become extremely important for many more areas spreading far beyond this traditional R&D niche. Energy efficiency has become a must in the connected network of battery-operated nodes known as Internet-of-Things (IoT). Wearable devices, home appliances, vehicles and security surveillance systems mostly rely on small sensors that should ideally operate on battery charge for days or even weeks. However, current battery efficiencies do not keep up with the growing demands of IoT nodes for power, forcing us to seek novel techniques for energy harvesting and power optimization. Additionally, energy-efficient ICT (Information and Communication Technology) infrastructures are a key issue for local and global economies. Some predict that, if current trends continue, the electricity consumption caused by the Internet will increase up to 30 times in the year 2030. The strong increase of wireless communication and the growth of cloud computing require orders of magnitude more computational power."

It makes it hard to predict, for a given structure, the most feasible input size that is completely explorable within a time budget. Iterative deepening generates inputs of size n before those of size n+1 and eliminates guesswork to find such size. We build on Korat algorithm for structural test generation and present iKorat – an incremental algorithm for efficient iterative deepening. It avoids redundant work as opposed to naïve Korat-based iterative deepening by using information from smaller sizes, which is kept in a highly compact format."

        "abstract": "The objective of this presentation is to illustrate that an electromagnetic macro modeling can properly predict the path loss exponent in a mobile cellular wireless communication system. This represents the variation of the path loss with distance from the base station antenna. Specifically, it will be shown that the path loss exponent is 3 preceded by a slow fading region and followed by the fringe region where the path loss exponent is 4. The size of these regions is determined by the height of the base station antenna. The relevant theory starts from the analysis of radiation from a vertical electric dipole situated over a horizontal imperfect ground plane as first considered by Sommerfeld in 1909. The various methods used to evaluate the Sommerfeld integrals are described for different regions. Then, accurate numerical analyses and experimental data will illustrate the above statements, validating the theory. Moreover, the experimental data reveal that a macro modeling of the environment using an appropriate electromagnetic analysis can accurately predict the path loss exponent for the propagation of radio waves in a cellular wireless communication system scenario without needing to recourse to other types of micromodeling."

Its importance as a spectrum analyser has been recognized in the design of cochlea implants, speech and audio coding, and speech and speaker recognition systems. In this presentation, cochlea modelling will be discussed from simple through to more advanced cochlear filter models. The application of these models to key speech processing systems, and the evolution of their design, such as cochlea implants, will then be explained. Future approaches to cochlea models for implant applications will be discussed, including building in adaptivity to the signal processing algorithms."

The earliest detection signs of potential breast cancer can be distinguishable by current screening techniques is the presence of microcalcifications (MCs). MCs are small crystal calcium apatite and their normal size ranges from 0.1mm to 0.5mm single crystals to groups up to a few centimeters in diameter. They are the first indication of breast cancer in more than 40% of all breast cancer cases, making their diagnosis critical. This research proposes Moment Preserving technique for detecting and isolating point microcalcifications. This method is being applied on images to detect microcalcifications.

Division operation is difficult in fixed operation, the dividend A is firstly converted into user-defined floating point, then the inverse is implemented in the invertor unit. B/A will complete with a fixed multiplication. Linear approximation theory and Newton-Raphson iteration are used in invertor unit. The major advanced of this arithmetic is that it easily combines with fixed operation, we can proposed user-defined floating point according to the range of dividend A and the accuracy can easily acquire. In this paper, invertor unit for A range to [0.5, 2) with 23 decimal bits is designed. It is compiled and implemented both on FPGA and Synopsys Design Compiler."

This study used cloud products from CloudSat (active detection) and AQUA (passive detection) to study the relationships between the variations of radiation characteristics and the physical structure characteristics of cloud. It was found that variations of cloud radiation illustrated a monotonic change to the variations of physical structures when conditions had little change. This means two cloud profiles with close radiative properties may also have close physical structures. For cloudy profiles with unknown internal structures, their vertical structures could then be inferred from other cloudy profiles with similar spectral radiative properties."

In our work we employ a set of existing weakness patterns and divide them into clusters or genres based on their semantical meaning. Consequently, we implement unique Compliance Checking methods for each different pattern cluster. The result of this paper represents a Compliance Checking Method Library which offers an exhaustive set of methods to identify many forms of ecological weaknesses in process models."

Then the focus of the talk will be on how to address the scaling challenges with novel circuit design techniques, ranging from low-power and high-performance digital to embedded memory, analog and mixed-signal circuits. Some real design examples will be used to illustrated the new design concepts that help to overcome the scaling challenges."

The Grey System theory introduced by Deng in 1982 has been nowadays proved to be an effective tool for studying systems with “poor” (uncertain, incomplete, etc.) In the present research Grey Numbers are used as tools for evaluating a system's mean performance when utilizing qualitative grades and not numerical scores for this purpose. Although this new assessment method is proved to be equivalent with an analogous method using Triangular Fuzzy Numbers as tools developed in an earlier work, it reduces the required computational burden, since it requires the calculation of two components only (instead of three in the case of the Triangular Fuzzy Numbers) for obtaining the mean value of the Grey Numbers involved. Examples are also presented on student and athlete assessment illustrating the new method and showing that a system's quality performance, calculated by the traditional GPA index, may lead to different assessment conclusions."

It is based on detailed analyses of 2440 inheritance hierarchies drawn from 14 open-source systems. The original contributions made by this paper concern pragmatic assessment of inheritance hierarchy design quality. The findings show that inheritance is very widely used but that most of the usage patterns that occur in practice are simple in structure. They are so simple that they may not require much inheritance-specific design consideration. On the other hand, the majority of classes defined using inheritance actually appear within a relatively small number of large, complex hierarchies. While some of these large hierarchies appear to have a consistent structure, often based on a problem domain model or a design pattern, others do not. Another contribution is that the quality of hierarchies, especially the large problematic ones, may be assessed in practice based on size, shape, and the definition and invocation of novel methods – all properties that can be detected automatically."

Executing these large test suites is expensive, both in terms of time and energy. Cache misses are a significant contributing factor to execution time of software. In this paper, we propose an approach that helps order test executions in a test suite in such a way that instruction cache misses are reduced, and thereby execution time. We conduct an empirical evaluation with 20 subject programs and test suites from the SIR repository, EEMBC suite and LLVM Symbolizer, comparing execution times and cache misses with test orderings maximising instruction locality versus a traditional ordering maximising coverage, as well as random permutations. Performance gains were considerable for programs and test suites where the average number of different instructions executed between tests was high. We achieved an average execution speedup of 6.83% and a maximum execution speedup of 17% over subject programs with differing control flow between test executions."

Tonight, we provide an opportunity for recognized experts to share their past mistakes and failures, and disclose lessons learned. After the panelists have confessed, the audience can also contribute “learning experiences” (in less than a minute). Inevitably, this collection of revelations will be motivating: inspiring to the young and inexperienced; and virtuous for gurus in sharing a universal truth — first-time perfection is rare!"

Machine learning has been successfully applied in many areas of software engineering ranging from behaviour extraction, to testing, to bug fixing. Many more applications are yet be defined. However, a better understanding of ML methods, their assumptions and guarantees would help software engineers adopt and identify the appropriate methods for their desired applications. We argue that this choice can be guided by the models one seeks to infer. In this technical briefing, we review and reflect on the applications of ML for software engineering organised according to the models they produce and the methods they use. We introduce the principles of ML, give an overview of some key methods, and present examples of areas of software engineering benefiting from ML. We also discuss the open challenges for reaching the full potential of ML for software engineering and how ML can benefit from software engineering methods."

It was created as part of an ethnographic study realized over a two-year period. It involved a working group formed by parents, students, teachers and school administrators who met monthly in a public school as part of a project aimed at improving school climate. Through cycles of implementation and feedback from the working group and two school administrators, we built an open source system to support the monitoring of indicators, objectives and actions defined and monitored locally. These analyses led to the construction of school 'rules' and guidelines during annual planing, becoming an important element in the construction of a more open and democratic school."

In the treatment, tumor should be heated up to the therapeutic temperature between 42 and 45oC. In Japan, large number of capacitive heating devices are employed for hyperthermic treatments. However, temperature distributions inside the patient body during the treatment have not been cleared. So, in this study, numerical calculations of temperature distributions inside patient body during the capacitive heating have been investigated. As a result, blood flow rate of a target tumor had a large influence to its temperature."

In particular, I shall talk about the state of negative capacitance that can be achieved in certain material systems with stored energy of phase transition. Our recent experiments with ferroelectric materials have shown that such a state of negative capacitance can actually be achieved. I shall also describe our very recent results where such negative capacitance, when combined with conventional transistors, lead to effects that was long believed to be impossible. Finally, I shall discuss how these effects can usher in a new era of energy efficient electronics."

By using the relationship between the wavelength of medical ultrasound and the RBC diameter, the attenuation of the ultrasound, which is due to Rayleigh scattering, can be determind. In our previous work, the PF proportionally declined with the logarithm of the aggregation degree. This study aims to experimentally verify the relationship between the aggregation degree and the PF with actual blood and develop a monitoring technique for RBC aggregation degree for extracorporeal treatment."

We will show the trade-offs in implementation cost and power over a range of implementations with varying bit-precisions. These implementations are leveraging novel python-based abstractions, that support a Jupyter Notebook interface. We will illustrate this with complete implementations on embedded platforms including the Pynq platform and on cloud-based platforms including the AWS F1 platform. Finally, we will project the new possibilities of the new 7nm based Xilinx platforms that contain specialized hardware that is very efficient for these neural network applications."

To maximize the Cu volume in its trench for lower line resistance, the thickness of the diffusion barrier material should be reduced accordingly. However, conventional barrier materials lose their capability of blocking Cu diffusion as their thickness is extremely reduced. It is well understood that ultra-thin diffusion barrier materials less than 1 nm are highly demanded. In this talk, we will show that the diffusion properties of several 2D materials are investigated by various characterization methods including time-dependent dielectric breakdown measurements. Besides significantly extended lifetime of the dielectrics surrounding Cu electrodes, reduced surface scattering is also observed at some 2D/Cu interfaces, providing strong evidence for promising alternative barrier solutions."

Such systems are of interest in remote sensing and medicine applications where the size, weight, and cost of the imaging system are important. However, these systems often suffer from low image quality resulting from the non-filled sparse aperture structure. In this work, total-variation based image restoration is used to improve the image quality of sparse aperture optical systems. To analyze the performance of image restoration, various periodic subaperture configurations are considered and comparison is also performed with classical Wiener filter. Numerical results demonstrate that sparse aperture imaging systems used with total-variation based image restoration can achieve similar resolution and image quality as with the equivalent fully filled aperture system."

In encrypted communication, third parties and supervisors can easily realize that a closed information is transmitted. Although this content cannot be resolved immediately, it can be marked as suspicious. Closed text can also be protected by using a hidden method instead of using an encryption method. The hidden text could be attributed “innocent” without notice by the third parties or systems. Recognizing the hidden text will become more difficult when it is included in everyday conversations. In this study, the work of hiding another text within a text encoded in the UTF-8 standard has been made for everyday communication applications. The method used in the study has been controlled by using instant messaging softwares which are widely used."

        "abstract": "Building energy consumption can be substantially reduced with latest technologies. The existing well-known example is to replace the conventional lighting with LEDs, which will result in more than 90% and 50% energy saving over incandescent and florescent lamps, respectively. There are many other technology areas that will further facilitate energy savings. So in addition to lighting, this presentation will provide an overview of building electrical power consumption and the potential energy saving technologies including dc distribution system, major home appliances, geothermal heating and cooling, and intelligent energy management system Basic operation of these building technologies and their potential energy savings will be discussed Critical component technologies such as power electronics and motor drives will be addressed Success of energy saving not only needs to come from technology development, but also can be facilitated by government mandates. The comprehensive development and adoption of new technologies can further increase the energy saving. For example, nearly all home appliances are d powered. Adopting the dc distribution system should help reduce multiple power conversion processes and achieve true potential of other appliances such as computer power and induction cooking. Government mandates may impact some conventional manufacturing but will bring up new industries and save substantial amount of energy in a long run. In summary a comprehensive approach is needed to achieve great potential of building energy saving."

The newly proposed L1-norm based estimator exploiting this duality can serve as a sound alternative to the existing L2-norm based estimator significantly lowering the implementation cost. Generalization of this duality empowers the single skew matrix representation of the I/Q imbalance model, mappable to an always existing unique SVD based model, to extend its compensation range limited too conservative so far with much higher level of confidence than ever before."

By identifying which characteristics of IaC scripts correlate with defects, we can identify anti-patterns, and help software practitioners make informed decisions on better development and maintenance of IaC scripts, and increase quality of IaC scripts. The goal of this paper is to help practitioners increase the quality of IaC scripts by identifying characteristics of IaC scripts and IaC development process that correlate with defects, and violate security and privacy objectives. We focus on characteristics of IaC scripts and IaC development that (i) correlate with IaC defects, and (ii) violate security and privacy-related objectives namely, confidentiality, availability, and integrity. For our initial studies, we mined open source version control systems from three organizations: Mozilla, Openstack, and Wikimedia, to identify the defect-related characteristics and conduct our case studies. From our empirical analysis, we identify (i) 14 IaC code and four churn characteristics that correlate with defects; and (ii) 12 process characteristics such as, frequency of changes, and ownership of IaC scripts that correlate with defects. We propose the following studies: (i) identify structural characteristics that correlate with defects; (ii) with respect to prediction performance, compare which characteristics of IaC scripts are more correlated with defects; and (iii) identify characteristics that violate security and privacy objectives."

        "abstract": "With the profiliferation of 3D sensors, 3D data analysis has become an important tool. Due to its capability of data summarization, sampling has taken a critical part of this analysis. In this paper, we argue that finding a universally good sampling is difficult, if not impossible and rather propose a task-tailored solution. In the scope of this work, we address the task of Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration and cast the point selection procedure as an optimization problem over the samples, minimizing the ICP energy. Because the parametrization over 3D points results in a discrete and large optimization problem, we benefit from genetic algorithms, which are proven to evolve into better solutions, at each time-step. The quantitative and qualitative results clearly demonstrate that we are able to obtain better results than the state-of-the-art."

        "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease in which inner surface of colon is inflamed. Ulcers and open scars on the colon are observed. The complaint in the flare period is the frequent bloody diarrhea. Complaints of people with UC increase and decrease periodically. Colonoscopy is the most preferred approach for the visualization of the gastrointestinal tract for the diagnosis and follow-up of related diseases, and UC in particular. The lack of experience of the colonoscopist, complicated locality of the lesion, and the rush in the colonoscopy suite to complete the procedure as soon as possible may cause mistakes in visual analysis. In this study, 200 colonoscopy images (100 normal, 100 UC) were used. The statistical features such as gray level variance, gray level local variance, normalized variance, histogram range, and entropy were extracted from the images, and a normalized 200x5 feature matrix was formed. The normal images and images with UC were discriminated using support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors. It should be noted that the extraction of only 5 features from the colonoscopy images resulted in 95% accuracy. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the development of software tools for aiding the physicians in the diagnosis of colon diseases."

        "abstract": "Model mining from software systems can be very helpful for program comprehension. The few existing approaches for extracting high level models from code – when applied to real-world systems written in C – deliver too detailed and complex models that cannot be understood by humans. In my Ph.D. project, I propose an approach that complements fully-automatic model mining approaches with user interaction to get understandable models. The evaluation of this approach includes a controlled experiment with a large number of experts, in order to assess the effectiveness of the interactively mined models for understanding complex legacy software."
