        "abstract": "Hashtags and replies, originally introduced on Twitter, have become the most popular ways to tag short messages in social networks. While the primary uses of these human-labeled metadata are still for message retrieval and clustering, there have been increasing attempts to use them as subject or topic indicators in measuring people's continuous sentiments in large message corpora. However, conducting the analysis for large social media data is still challenging due to the message volume, heterogeneity, and temporal dependence. In this paper, we present TagNet, a novel visualization approach tailored to the tag-based sentiment analysis. TagNet combines traditional tag clouds with an improved node-link diagram to represent the time-varying heterogeneous information with reduced visual clutter. A force model is leveraged to generate layout aesthetics from which the temporal patterns of tags can be easily compared across different subsets of data. It is enhanced by visual encodings for quickly estimating the time-varying sentiment. Interaction tools are provided to improve the scalability for exploring large corpora. An example Twitter corpus illustrates the applicability and usefulness of TagNet."

This paper presents our study on comparative 3D visualization tool for the comparison of mode water regions. We extract pairs of outer boundaries of mode water regions as isosurfaces and calculate dissimilarity values between the pairs. The tool visualizes the multi-dimensional vectors of the dissimilarity values by Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCP) and provides a user interface to specify particular pairs of mode water regions so that we can comparatively visualize the shapes of the regions.

In specific, we first conduct temporal segmentation to a given animated meshes with sub-motions, then apply spatial segmentation within each temporal segment, and intersect spatial segmentation result for over segmentation.

With the coming era of Industry 4.0 (or industrial internet), more and more assets and machines in plants are equipped with various sensors and information systems, which brings an unprecedented opportunity to capture large-scale and fine-grained data for effective on-line equipment condition monitoring. However, due to the lack of systematic methods, analysts still find it challenging to carry out efficient analyses and extract valuable information from the mass volume of data collected, especially for process industry (e.g., a petrochemical plant) with complex manufacturing procedures. In this paper, we report the design and implementation of an interactive visual analytics system, which helps managers and operators at manufacturing sites leverage their domain knowledge and apply substantial human judgements to guide the automated analytical approaches, thus generating understandable and trustable results for real-world applications. Our system integrates advanced analytical algorithms (e.g., Gaussian mixture model with a Bayesian framework) and intuitive visualization designs to provide a comprehensive and adaptive semi-supervised solution to equipment condition monitoring. The example use cases based on a real-world manufacturing dataset and interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of our system."

Specifically, we transform each instance of the time-varying graph into a metric space, extract topological features using persistent homology, and compare those features over time. We provide a visualization that assists in time-varying graph exploration and helps to identify patterns of behavior within the data. To validate our approach, we conduct several case studies on real-world datasets and show how our method can find cyclic patterns, deviations from those patterns, and one-time events in time-varying graphs. We also examine whether a persistence-based similarity measure satisfies a set of well-established, desirable properties for graph metrics."

We set the ultimate goal of developing a visual analytic approach and tool for risk dissolving and decision-making. We have consolidated four main analysis tasks conducted by financial experts: i) Multi-faceted Default Risk Visualization, whereby a hybrid representation is devised to predict the default risk and an interface developed to visualize key indicators; ii) Risk Guarantee Patterns Discovery. We follow the Shneiderman mantra guidance for designing interactive visualization applications, whereby an interactive risk guarantee community detection and a motif detection based risk guarantee pattern discovery approach are described; iii) Network Evolution and Retrospective, whereby animation is used to help users to understand the guarantee dynamic; iv) Risk Communication Analysis. The temporal diffusion path analysis can be useful for the government and banks to monitor the spread of the default status. It also provides insight for taking precautionary measures to prevent and dissolve systematic financial risk. We implement the system with case studies using real-world bank loan data. Two financial experts are consulted to endorse the developed tool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first visual analytics tool developed to explore networked-guarantee loan risks in a systematic manner."

Low cost post analysis machines used by scientists to view and analyze these massive datasets are severely limited by their deficiencies in storage bandwidth, capacity, and computational power. Trying to simply move these datasets to these platforms is infeasible. Any approach to view and analyze these datasets on post analysis machines will have to effectively address the inevitable problem of data loss. Image based approaches are well suited for handling very large datasets on low cost platforms. Three challenges with these approaches are how to effectively represent the original data with minimal data loss, analyze the data in regards to transfer function exploration, which is a key analysis tool, and quantify the error from data loss during analysis. We present a novel image based approach using distributions to preserve data integrity. At each view sample, view dependent data is summarized at each pixel with distributions to define a compact proxy for the original dataset. We present this representation along with how to manipulate and render large scale datasets on post analysis machines. We show that our approach is a good trade off between rendering quality and interactive speed and provides uncertainty quantification for the information that is lost."

Performing sampling on the bitmapindexing based data representation allows further reduction of storage overhead and be more flexible to meet the requirements of different applications. In this paper, we propose two approaches to solve two potential limitations when exploring and visualizing the data using sampling-based bitmap indexing data representation. First, we propose an adaptive sampling approach called information guided stratified sampling (IGStS) for creating compact sampled datasets that preserves the important characteristics of the raw data. Furthermore, we propose a novel data recovery approach to reconstruct the irregular subsampled dataset into a volume dataset with regular grid structure for qualitative post-hoc data exploration and visualization. The quantitative and visual efficacy of our proposed data sampling and recovery approaches are demonstrated through multiple experiments and applications."

Certain techniques allow users to control the pointwise error induced by the compression. However, in many scenarios it is desirable to control in a similar way the preservation of higher-level notions, such as topological features, in order to provide guarantees on the outcome of post-hoc data analyses. This paper presents the first compression technique for scalar data which supports a strictly controlled loss of topological features. It provides users with specific guarantees both on the preservation of the important features and on the size of the smaller features destroyed during compression. In particular, we present a simple compression strategy based on a topologically adaptive quantization of the range. Our algorithm provides strong guarantees on the bottleneck distance between persistence diagrams of the input and decompressed data, specifically those associated with extrema. A simple extension of our strategy additionally enables a control on the pointwise error. We also show how to combine our approach with state-of-the-art compressors, to further improve the geometrical reconstruction. Extensive experiments, for comparable compression rates, demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in terms of the preservation of topological features. We show the utility of our approach by illustrating the compatibility between the output of post-hoc topological data analysis pipelines, executed on the input and decompressed data, for simulated or acquired data sets. We also provide a lightweight VTK-based C++ implementation of our approach for reproduction purposes."

This problem becomes more challenging when an ensemble of simulations are required to run for studying the influence of input parameters on the model output. As a result, scientists are inclining more towards analyzing the data in situ while it resides in the memory. In situ analysis aims at minimizing expensive data movement while maximizing the resource utilization for extraction of important information from the data. In this work, we study the evolution of rotating stall in jet engines using data generated from a large-scale flow simulation under various input conditions. Since the features of interest lack a precise descriptor, we adopt a fuzzy rule-based machine learning algorithm for efficient and robust extraction of such features. For scalable exploration, we advocate for an off-line learning and in situ prediction driven strategy that facilitates in-depth study of the stall. Task-specific information estimated in situ is visualized interactively during the post-hoc analysis revealing important details about the inception and evolution of stall. We verify and validate our method through comprehensive expert evaluation demonstrating the efficacy of our approach."

The challenge for the proxy graph approach is to ensure that the proxy graph is a good representation of the original graph. However, previous work to compute proxy graphs using graph sampling techniques often fails to preserve connectivity and important global skeletal structure in the original graph. This paper introduces two new families of proxy graph methods BCP-W and BCP-E, tightly integrating graph sampling methods with the BC (Block Cut-vertex) tree, which represents the decomposition of a graph into biconnected components. Experimental results using graph sampling quality metrics show that our new BC treebased proxy graph methods produce significantly better results than existing sampling-based proxy graph methods: 25% improvement by BCP-W and 15% by BCP-E on average. We also present DBCP, a BC tree-based proxy graph method for distributed environment. Experiments on the Amazon Cloud EC2 demonstrate that DBCP is scalable for big graph data sets; runtime speed-up of 77% for distributed 5-server on average. Visual comparison using a graph layout method and the proxy quality metrics confirm that our new BC tree-based proxy graph methods are significantly better than existing sampling-based proxy graph method. Our main results lead to guidelines for computing sampling-based proxy graphs for visualization of big graphs."

        "abstract": "Discovering fraud user behaviors is vital to keeping online websites healthy. Fraudsters usually exhibit grouping behaviors, and researchers have effectively leveraged this behavior to design unsupervised algorithms to detect fraud user groups. In this work, we propose a visualization system, FraudVis, to visually analyze the unsupervised fraud detection algorithms from temporal, intra-group correlation, inter-group correlation, feature selection, and the individual user perspectives. FraudVis helps domain experts better understand the algorithm output and the detected fraud behaviors. Meanwhile, FraudVis also helps algorithm experts to fine-tune the algorithm design through the visual comparison. By using the visualization system, we solve two real-world cases of fraud detection, one for a social video website and another for an e-commerce website. The results on both cases demonstrate the effectiveness of FraudVis in understanding unsupervised fraud detection algorithms."

In particular, we report on: (1) the most effective visual encoding of multivariate data for each of the six common tasks considered; (2) common strategies that our participants used when the two views were combined based on eye-tracking data analysis; (3) the finding that these views are perceptually complementary in the sense that they both show the same information, but with different and complementary support for different types of analysis. For the combined view, our studies show that there is a perceptually complementary effect in terms of significantly improved accuracy for certain tasks, but that there is a small cost in terms of slightly longer completion time than the faster of the two techniques alone. Eye-movement data shows that for many tasks participants were able to swiftly switch their strategies after trying both in the training phase."

While protein data inherently contains uncertainty due to the acquisition method or the simulation algorithm, we argue that it is also worth investigating uncertainty induced by analysis algorithms that precede visualization. Our technique helps researchers investigate differences between multiple secondary structure assignment methods. We modify established algorithms for fuzzy classification and introduce a discrepancy-based approach to project an ensemble of sequences to a single importance-weighted sequence. In 2D, we depict the aggregated secondary structure assignments based on the per-residue deviation in a collapsible sequence diagram. In 3D, we extend the ribbon diagram using visual variables such as transparency, wave form, frequency, or amplitude to facilitate qualitative analysis of uncertainty. We evaluated the effectiveness and acceptance of our technique through expert reviews using two example applications: the combined assignment against established algorithms and time-dependent structural changes originating from simulated protein dynamics."

The main challenges include the overwhelming number of low-risk events and their multifaceted relationships which form the collective anomaly, the diversity in various data and anomaly types, and the difficulty to incorporate domain knowledge in the anomaly analysis process. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of high-order correlation graph (HOCG). Compared with the previous correlation graph definition, HOCG achieves better user interactivity, computational scalability, and domain generality through synthesizing heterogeneous types of nodes, attributes, and multifaceted relationships in a single graph. We design elaborate visual metaphors, interaction models, and the coordinated multiple view based interface to allow users to fully unleash the visual analytics power over HOCG. We conduct case studies in two real-life application domains, i.e., facility monitoring and software analysis. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of HOCG in the overview of point anomalies, detection of collective anomalies, and reasoning process of root cause analysis."

        "abstract": "Studies on augmenting visualization with sound are typically based on the assumption that sound can be complementary and assist in data analysis tasks. While sound promotes a different sense of engagement than vision, we conjecture that by augmenting non-speech audio to a visualization can not only help enhance the users' perception of the data but also increase their engagement with the data exploration process. We have designed a preliminary user study to test users' performance and engagement while exploring in a data visualization system under two different settings: visual-only and audiovisual. For our study, we used basketball player movement data in a game and created an interactive visualization system with three linked views. We supplemented sound to the visualization to enhance the users' understanding of a team's offensive/defensive behavior. The results of our study suggest that we need to better understand the effect of sound choice and encoding before considering engagement. We also find that sound can be useful to draw novice users' attention to patterns or anomalies in the data. Finally, we propose follow-up studies with designs informed by the findings from this study."

        "abstract": "In the information visualization reference model, visual mapping is the most crucial step in producing a visualization from a data set. The conventional visual mapping maps each data attribute onto a single visual channel (e.g. the year of production of a car to the position on the horizontal axis). In this work, we investigate composite visual mapping: mapping single data attributes onto several visual channels, each one representing one aspect of the data attribute (e.g. its order of magnitude, or its trend component). We first propose a table which allows us to explore the design space of composite mappings by offering a systematic overview of channel combinations. We expect that using more than one visual channel for communicating a data attribute increases the bandwidth of information presentation by displaying separable information on different aspects of data. In order to evaluate this point, we compare horizon graph, an existing technique which successfully adopts a composite visual mapping, with a selection of alternative composite mappings. We show that some of those mappings perform as well as –and in some cases even better than– horizon graph in terms of accuracy and speed. Our results confirm that the benefits of composite visual mapping are not limited to horizon graph. We thus recommend the use of composite visual mapping when users are simultaneously interested in several aspects of data attributes."

Instead of static data assignment, we dynamically repartition the data into blocks and reassign the blocks to processes to balance the workload distribution among the processes. Block repartitioning is performed based on a dynamic workload estimation method that predicts the workload in the flow field on the fly as the input. In our approach, we allow data duplication in the repartitioning, enabling the same data blocks to be assigned to multiple processes. Load balance is achieved by regularly exchanging the blocks (together with the particles in the blocks) among processes according to the output of the data repartitioning. Compared with other load-balancing algorithms, our approach does not need any preprocessing on the raw data and does not require any dedicated process for work scheduling, while it has the capability to balance uneven workload efficiently. Results show improved load balance and high efficiency of our method on tracing particles in both steady and unsteady flow."

        "abstract": "Linear layouts are a simple and natural way to draw a graph: all vertices are placed on a single line and edges are drawn as arcs between the vertices. Despite its simplicity, a linear layout can be a very meaningful visualization if there is a particular order defined on the vertices. Common examples of such ordered - and often also directed - graphs are event sequences and processes. A main drawback of linear layouts are the usually (very) large aspect ratios of the resulting drawings, which prevent users from obtaining a good overview of the whole graph. In this paper we present a novel and versatile algorithm to optimally fold a linear layout of a graph such that it can be drawn nicely in a specified aspect ratio, while still clearly communicating the linearity of the layout. Our algorithm allows vertices to be drawn as blocks or rectangles of specified sizes to incorporate different drawing styles, label sizes, and even recursive structures. For reasonably-sized drawings the folded layout can be computed interactively. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm on graphs that represent process trees, a particular type of process model. Our algorithm arguably produces much more readable layouts than existing methods."

By visually integrating the initiation and developmental processes of organisms, we might reveal new causalities in biological data. Here we present an integrated visualization system for a causality network constructed from phenotypic developmental characters and their related scientific literature. To obtain the phenotypic characters, we applied bio-imaging informatics techniques to the data of wet experiments. The phenotypic character network was visually rendered in the CausalNet system, which provides both explanatory and verification visualization functions. Statistical analysis and scientific literature mining proved useful for determining the mechanisms underlying the phenotypic trait network. The validity of the system was confirmed in an application example and expert feedback on the developmental process of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The discussed methodology is applicable to other multicellular organisms."

By adapting to what the user actually sees, they act as proxies that allow for goal-oriented modifications while still providing an intuitive set of simple operations that is easy to control. In particular, our method is well-suited for direct manipulation scenarios such as touch screens, where traditional user interface elements commonly exhibit limited utility. To evaluate out approach we conducted a qualitative user study with nine participants with various backgrounds."

Our system utilizes a state transition model to monitor both the camera and the data, and manages the initiation, duration, and termination of deformation with animation. Our method can be applied to multiple types of scientific datasets, including volumetric data, polygon mesh data, and particle data.

Whereas one component is geometric but invariant to rotations, two other components are based on the topological structure of the molecules and thus additionally invariant to deformations. By combining these three components, which aim at the analysis of simulation ensembles of such molecules, and complementing them with a space-time representation that enables detailed interactive inspection of individual simulations, we obtain a versatile tool for the analysis of the fragmentation of structured, symmetrical molecules such as fullerenes. We exemplify the utility of our approach using a tightly coupled simulation approach for the dynamics of fullerenes."
