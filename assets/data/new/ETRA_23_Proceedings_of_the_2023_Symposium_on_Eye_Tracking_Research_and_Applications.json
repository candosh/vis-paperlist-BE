However, due to relatively low update rates and high latencies of current commercially available eye trackers, gaze events are typically detected after they occur with some delay. This limits interaction scenarios such as intent-based gaze interaction, redirected walking, or gaze forecasting."

The first approach uses feature importance in a greedy way and grows or shrinks AOIs in all directions. The second approach is an extension of the first approach, which divides the AOIs into areas and calculates a direction of growth, i.e. a gradient. Both approaches improve the classification results considerably in the case of generalized AOIs, but can also be used for qualitative analysis. In qualitative analysis, the algorithms presented allow the AOIs to be adapted to the data, which means that errors and inaccuracies in eye tracking data can be better compensated for. A good application example is abstract art, where manual AOIs annotation is hardly possible, and data-driven approaches are mainly used for initial AOIs."

These methods provide saliency maps to highlight important input features of a specific eye gaze sequence. However, to date, its localization analysis has been lacking a quantitative approach across entire datasets. In this work, we employ established gaze event detection algorithms for fixations and saccades and quantitatively evaluate the impact of these events by determining their concept influence. Input features that belong to saccades are shown to be substantially more important than features that belong to fixations. By dissecting saccade events into sub-events, we are able to show that gaze samples that are close to the saccadic peak velocity are most influential. We further investigate the effect of event properties like saccadic amplitude or fixational dispersion on the resulting concept influence."

However, little is known about visual search patterns and strategies radiologists employ during medical image analysis. Thus, there is a current need for guidelines to specify optimal visual search routines commonly used by radiologists. Identifying these features could improve radiologist training and assist radiologists in their work. Our study found that during the moments in which radiologists view chest X-ray images in silence before verbalizing the analysis, they exhibit unique search patterns regardless of the type of disease depicted. Our findings suggest that radiologists’ search behaviors can be identified at this stage. However, when radiologists verbally interpret the X-rays, the gaze patterns appear noisy and arbitrary. Current deep-learning approaches train their systems using this noisy and arbitrary gaze data. This may explain why previous research still needs to show the superiority of deep-learning models that use eye tracking for disease classification. Our paper investigates these patterns and attempts to uncover the eye-gaze configurations during the different analysis phases."

Our objective was to determine whether eye tracking can be used to investigate differences in performance between recently trained users and experts and then provide insight into any differences. After EMR training, medical personnel performed a set of medical tasks using their EMR. Their performance (accuracy and response time) and three eye tracking metrics (spatial density, mean saccade length, and mean fixation duration) were recorded. These measures were then compared to those of an expert user. The analysis showed that the expert was significantly more focused and targeted in the use of the EMR. The results suggest that eye tracking is a promising objective approach to measure the effectiveness of EMR training and the proficiency of users. Suggestions for improved EMR design and training are also provided."

In this work, we re-define five static gaze patterns that cover all the status during a dyadic communication and propose a network to recognize these mutual exclusive gaze patterns given an image. We annotate a benchmark, called GP-Static, for the gaze pattern recognition task, on which our method experimentally outperforms other alternate solutions. Our method also achieves the state-of-art performance on other two single gaze pattern recognition tasks. The analysis of gaze patterns on preschool children demonstrates that the statistic of the proposed static gaze patterns conforms with the findings in psychology."

Done frequently, this can become a tedious and fatiguing task, especially for tablets where users physically employ a stylus or finger touch. As our eyes are naturally involved in visual search and acquisition of desired menu items, we propose gaze to shortcut the physical movement. We investigate gaze-based mode-switching for menus in tablets by a novel mode-switching methodology, assessing a gaze-only (dwell-time) and multimodal (gaze and tap) technique, compared to hand-based interaction. The results suggest that users can efficiently alternate between manual and eye input when interacting with the menu; both gaze-based techniques have lower physical demand and individual speed-error trade-offs. This led to a novel technique that substantially reduces time by unifying mode-selection and mode-application. Our work points to new roles for our eyes to efficiently short-cut menu actions during the workflow."

We present GE-Simulator, a novel open-source Unity toolkit that allows the simulation of accuracy, precision, and data loss errors during real-time usage by adding gaze vector errors into the gaze vector from the head-mounted AR/VR eye tracker. The tool is customisable without having to change the source code and changes in eye tracking errors during and in-between usage. Our toolkit allows designers to prototype new applications at different levels of eye tracking in the early phases of design and can be used to evaluate techniques with users at varying signal quality levels."

This technology is rapidly improving, but falls flat when reconstructing some attributes, particularly gaze. Image-based loss metrics that consider the full face do not effectively capture the perceptually important, yet spatially small, eye regions. Improving gaze in face swaps can improve naturalness and realism, benefiting applications in entertainment, human computer interaction, and more. Improved gaze will also directly improve Deepfake detection efforts, serving as ideal training data for classifiers that rely on gaze for classification. We propose a novel loss function that leverages gaze prediction to inform the face swap model during training and compare against existing methods. We find all methods to significantly benefit gaze in resulting face swaps."

Potentially, an approach combining slow/high-fidelity and fast/low-fidelity sensors should be able to exploit their complementarity to track fast eye motion accurately and robustly. To foster research on this topic, we introduce OpenSFEDS, a near-eye gaze estimation dataset containing approximately 2M synthetic camera-photosensor image pairs sampled at 500 Hz under varied appearance and camera position. We also formulate the task of sensor fusion for gaze estimation, proposing a deep learning framework consisting in appearance-based encoding and temporal eye-state dynamics. We evaluate several single- and multi-rate fusion baselines on OpenSFEDS, achieving 8.7% error decrease when tracking fast eye movements with a multi-rate approach vs. a gaze forecasting approach operating with a low-speed sensor alone."

Fiducial markers are made invisible through the use of film passing Infra-Red (IR) light while blocking the visible spectrum. An IR light source is used to illuminate the markers which are then detected by an IR-sensitive camera, but which are imperceptible by the human eye. We provide the first empirical study that demonstrates such invisible markers are not distracting to a given task, as demonstrated in a flight simulator where distraction of visible and invisible markers are compared between experienced and novice pilots. Fixation frequency and subjective distraction scores showed that visible markers disrupted natural gaze behaviour, particularly in novice pilots. Our findings show that invisible markers should be used when there is a need for them to remain inconspicuous."

EEG-based eye tracking is a new and difficult research topic in the field of eye tracking, but it provides an alternative to image-based eye tracking with an input data set comparable to conventional image processing. The presented DNN exploits spatial dependencies of the EEG signal and uses convolutions similar to spatial filtering, which is used for preprocessing EEG signals. By this, we improve the direct gaze determination from the EEG signal compared to the state of the art by 3.5 cm MAE (Mean absolute error), but unfortunately still do not achieve a directly applicable system, since the inaccuracy is still significantly higher compared to image-based eye trackers."

Using target objects whose location could either be strongly predicted by scene context (High Certainty) or not (Low Certainty), we examined how attention was initially distributed across a scene image during search. To do so, an unexpected distractor object suddenly appeared either in the relevant or irrelevant scene region for each target type. Distractors will be more disruptive where attention is allocated. We found that for High Certainty targets, the distractors were fixated significantly more often when they appeared in relevant than irrelevant regions, but there was no such difference for Low Certainty targets. This finding demonstrated differential patterns of attentional distribution around the fixation point based on the predicted location of target objects within a scene."

Three factor scores were calculated from the PLR waveform features for each response. Responses were summarised and the differences between the two eyes were calculated in order to detect asynchronicity of PLRs in response to a light pulse on either eye. Pupillary oscillation was also measured separately without light pulses, and frequency powers were evaluated. Probabilities for the level of dementia of each participant were predicted using two types of regression functions for MCI+AD or AD patients, which were optimised using a variable selection procedure for extracted features. In the results, some variables which represent asynchronous measurement and pupillary oscillation were selected, and the requirement of binocular measurement was confirmed. A prediction procedure for levels of dementia of participants using the optimised functions was proposed, and performance was evaluated."

        "abstract": "Pupil diameter is a reliable indicator of mental effort, but it must be baseline corrected to account for its idiosyncratic nature. Established methods for measuring baselines cannot be applied in virtual reality (VR) experiments. To reliably measure a pupil diameter baseline in VR, we propose a short testing environment of visual arithmetic tasks. In an experiment with 66 university students, we analyzed external reliability and internal validity criteria for pupil diameter measures during counting and summation tasks. During the counting task, we found a high retest reliability between stimulus intervals. Acceptable retest reliability was found for task repetition at a second measuring time. Analyzing internal validity, we found that pupil diameter increased with task difficulty comparing both tasks. Further, a linear effect was found between the pupil diameter amplitude and luminance levels. Our findings highlight the potential of counting tasks as a pupil diameter baseline for VR experiments."

However, the scarcity of such data poses a major challenge. We, therefore, present SP-EyeGAN, a neural network that generates synthetic raw eye-tracking data. SP-EyeGAN consists of Generative Adversarial Networks; it produces a sequence of gaze angles indistinguishable from human micro- and macro-movements. We demonstrate how the generated synthetic data can be used to pre-train a model using contrastive learning. This model is fine-tuned on labeled human data for the task of interest. We show that for the task of predicting reading comprehension from eye movements, this approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art."

        "abstract": "A long tradition in eye movement research has focused on three linguistic variables explaining fixation durations during sentence reading: word length, frequency, and predictability. Lengths and frequencies are easily obtainable but predictabilities are tedious to collect, requiring the incremental cloze procedure. Modern large language models are trained using the objective of predicting the next word given previous context, hence they readily provide predictability information. This capability has largely been overlooked in eye movement research. Here we investigate the suitability of a synthetic predictability measure, extracted from pretrained GPT-2 models, as a surrogate for cloze predictability. Using several published eye movement corpora, we find that synthetic and cloze predictabilities are highly correlated, and that their influence on eye movements is qualitatively similar. Similar patterns are obtained when including synthetic predictabilities in data sets lacking cloze predictabilities. In conclusion, synthetic predictabilities can serve as a substitute for empirical cloze predictabilities."

With the improvement of the quality of head-mounted virtual reality devices (HMDs) over the past 10 years, eye tracking has been added to capture gaze in immersive environments. The use of HMDs with eye tracking is increasing significantly and so is the need for a toolbox enabling consensus about eye tracking methods in 3D. We present the Salient360! toolbox: it implements functions to identify saccades and fixations and output gaze characteristics (e.g., fixation duration or saccade directions), to generate saliency maps, fixation maps, and scanpath data. It also implements routines made to compare gaze data that were adapted to 3D. We hope that this toolbox will spark discussions about the methodology of 3D gaze processing, facilitate running experiments, and improve the gaze study in 3D.   https://github.com/David-Ef/salient360Toolbox"

Whereas attention is guided bottom-up by low-level saliency, top-down guidance involves the viewer’s knowledge and expectations accumulated throughout a lifetime. Here we explore the influence of high-level scene-object relations on viewing behavior. To assess top-down guidance, we score the relevance of linguistic object labels using methods from document analysis. Specifically, we computed the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), a statistic that reflects how important a term is to a document. We use object TF-IDF to measure how important a specific object is to a scene category and use these scores to predict eye movement distributions over scenes. Our results show that scene-specific objects are more likely to be fixated. Object TF-IDF had an effect partially independent of image saliency, suggesting that an object’s relevance for a scene category affects attention during scene perception."

We observe a strong visual bias across all experimental conditions supporting earlier assumptions of a screen center or motor bias. The tendency towards the center was particular evident during trials that lack any specific assignment. A time-sensitive differentiation of eye movements with regards to memory and anticipation tasks could not be recorded. Also, pupil diameter indicated no relationship between changes in bodily arousal and spontaneous fixation behavior. In addition, we replicate a strong left side gaze asymmetry that is interwoven with the center bias featuring spontaneous fixations to mainly cluster left from the screen center."

Total Scanning Duration, Fixation count, Total Fixation Duration, and Total Saccadic Duration were found significant for distinguishing good and bad performers across tasks. Peak Velocity and Mean Pupil Diameter were found significant for varying task complexity. This was also reflected in time-matched samples of good and bad performers in TOH and ISP, though the content complexity of both these tasks remained constant. We propose that Peak Velocity and Mean Pupil Diameter are markers of ‘perceived task complexity’. Poor performers perceive tasks to be more complex even when content complexity is constant, and this affects their performance."

Older children with ASD focused on extremities while older typically developing (TD) children looked at figure’s heads, whereas not evident in the younger groups. These results suggest developmental advances in social-information biases in TD children not evident in children with ASD, together with atypical and potentially adaptive increases in attentional biases towards local motion cues with age in ASD. Potential avenues for future computational and methodological analyses are discussed."

The results showed that not only is context important, but that it depended on its reliability, showing a dynamic application over time. Eye movement patterns reflect this dynamic application of high-level information. This framework will allow us to define and detect different cognitive strategies as well as the switch between them, signaling a change in prioritization and a change in the influence of context."

In this study, we test the reliability of webcam-based eye-tracking on a specific task: Eye movement distribution analysis for CVD (Colour Vision Deficiency) detection. We introduce a new publicly available eye movement dataset based on a pilot study (n=12) on images with dominant red colour (previously shown to be difficult with dichromatic AOI to investigate CVD by comparing attention patterns obtained in webcam eye-tracking sessions). We hypothesized that webcam eye tracking without infrared support could detect differing attention patterns between CVD and non-CVD participants and observed statistically significant differences, allowing the retention of our hypothesis."

Existing research has investigated the interaction between humans and automated systems and has identified the maintenance of situation awareness (SA) as a key challenge for humans. Especially in the context of intelligent writing assistants, humans have to maintain SA as they are held responsible for the written text. Eye tracking is the key technology that enables the non-invasive detection of situation awareness based on eye movements. Building on existing research on human-robot/AI collaboration and their interplay with SA theory, we propose the augmentation of human interaction with intelligent writing assistants through the use of eye tracking technology. On this basis, writing assistants can be adapted to users’ cognitive states such as SA. We argue that for the successful implementation of intelligent writing assistants in the real world, eye-based analysis of SA and augmentation are key."

Our gaze estimation network contains a predefined computation module that calculates gaze directions using known geometric relationships among head poses, eye-ball positions, and gaze directions. Updated face-shape parameters contribute to improving the performance of the process. In addition, the computation module enables a network to acquire the ability to induce hidden parameters such as eyeball position and eyeball radius from observed information through a training process. Experimental results reveal improvement in gaze estimation accuracy by introducing a sequential update process for face-shape parameters and a predefined computation module."

Moreover, we are able to replicate these results with a different eye tracking data set recorded in a different virtual city. Finally, the initial model selection process of the participant’s performance in a point-to-building task in the second city suggests a stronger influence of graph-theoretical predictors on the performance compared to the non-graph related measures, however more research will be necessary to determine their relationship."

In this paper, we present our work towards an integrated eye-tracking and affect recognition tool for use during software development. This combined approach could enhance our understanding of software development by combining information about the code developers are looking at, along with the emotions they experience. The presented tool utilizes an unmodified webcam to capture video of software developers while interacting with code. The tool passes each frame to two modules, an eye tracking module that estimates where the developer is looking on the screen, and an affect recognition module that infers developer emotion from their facial expressions. The proposed work has implications to researchers, educators, and practitioners, and we discuss some potential use cases in this paper."

This study examined the value of data loss in eye tracking and proposed a new method to utilize lost data in predicting the clinical characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We used eye tracking to confirm previous findings on atypical attention patterns and further utilized behavior coding to examine the three types of causes of data loss including blinks, non-compliant behaviors, and technical errors. We discovered that data loss due to blinking was associated with a lack of interest in social cues, and data loss due to non-compliance predicted a greater severity of ASD symptoms. These results suggest that the loss of data in eye tracking is meaningful as a measure of diminished social attention and a reflection of clinical characteristics in ASD."

        "abstract": "Eye-tracking is a key sensing technology for upcoming retinal projection augmented reality (AR) glasses. State-of-the-art eye-tracking sensor technologies rely on video oculography (VOG) and 3D model based gaze estimation algorithms, which infer gaze from observations of the projected pupil over time. The convergence time of these algorithms relies heavily on the pupil ellipse fitting accuracy. In this work, we investigate the effects of pupil ellipse contour noise and pupil center noise on the convergence time of a state-of-the-art eye-tracking approach and show that the convergence time relies heavily on a sub-pixel accurate pupil ellipse fitting and can reach tens of seconds for inaccurately fitted ellipses."

For that, a highly natural, immersive, and controllable environment is essential to investigators. Currently, next to mobile eye-tracking in the wild, virtual reality is becoming state-of-the-art for such experiments, combining several eye-tracking modalities’ strengths. Next to simulations, omnidirectional video footage is massively used. 360°cameras capture these videos with resolutions of up to 16k. Afterward, they can be replayed on virtual reality glasses to learn about human behavior in a realistic, highly controlled environment. However, the pipeline from stitched video to eye-tracking experiment results depends on costly proprietary or self-developed software that lacks standardization, leading to recurrent reimplementation. This paper describes an open-source stimuli organization and presentation software implementation that enables researchers to easily organize their stimuli in a standardized way and conduct eye-tracking studies in virtual reality with a few clicks without knowledge about coding or technical details.

A core challenge with eye-tracking data is that it inherently suffers from missing data due to blinks. Approaches such as intent prediction and user state recognition process gaze data using neural networks; however, they often have difficulty handling missing information. In an effort to understand how prior work dealt with missing data, we found that researchers often simply ignore missing data or adopt use-case-specific approaches, such as artificially filling in missing data. This inconsistency in handling missing data in eye tracking hinders the development of effective intelligent systems for predicting user actions and limits reproducibility. Furthermore, this can even lead to incorrect results. Thus, this lack of standardization calls for investigating possible solutions to improve the consistency and effectiveness of processing eye-tracking data for user action prediction."

Automatic detection of blinks has valuable practical importance. While existing deep neural networks excel in extracting spatial features from images and demonstrate impressive performance in visual object recognition, their application for blink detection in videos on a frame-by-frame basis is suboptimal, as they only consider spatial features from single images. In this paper, we developed a spatial-temporal-aware deep learning framework that capitalizes on the rapid advancements of the existing state-of-the-art visual object recognition networks, aiming to enhance their performance specifically in blink detection. Our framework takes consecutive frames as input to extract spatial and temporal features simultaneously for better detection of eye movements. We also propose a sliding window re-sampling strategy to mitigate overfitting on training data. Extensive experimental evaluations and comparisons demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, which delivers excellent performance for detecting blinks."

Prior work showed that torus drawing affords greater flexibility in clutter reduction than traditional node-link representations, but impedes link-and-path exploration tasks, while repeating tiles around boundaries aids comprehension. However, it remains unclear what strategies users apply in different wrapping settings. This is important for design implications for future work on more effective wrapped visualizations for network applications, and cyclic data that could benefit from wrapping. We perform visual-exploratory data analysis of gaze data, and conduct statistical tests derived from the patterns identified. Results show distinguishable gaze behaviors, with more visual glances and transitions between areas of interest in the non-replicated layout. Full-context has more successful visual searches than partial-context, but the gaze allocation indicates that the layout could be more space-efficient."

The quality of the prediction depends on the spatial similarity between the predicted and the observed fixated and non-fixated areas. Typically, (dis)similarity is evaluated by computing distribution-based metrics. However, the shortcoming of the metric scores is that they provide no information about the different types of (dis)similarities present in the prediction, for example, to determine whether the prediction fails wholly or partially to account for all the fixations. In this paper, we propose a set of features for representing the spatial (dis)similarities using intersection-over-union features, which provide helpful information that cannot be retrieved with traditional metrics for analyzing and evaluating prediction maps. We exemplify the usage of the features by analyzing the performance of different prediction models on a saliency benchmark dataset."

Gazealytics features coordinated views unifying spatiotemporal exploration of fixations and scanpaths for various analytical tasks. A novel matrix representation allows analysis of relationships between such spatial or temporal features. Data can be grouped across samples, user-defined AOIs or time windows of interest (TWIs) to support aggregate or filtered analysis of gaze activity.

One feature of such models is the ability to take an image as input and adjust content according to a prompt. Hence, privacy-preserving visualization of stimuli can be achieved for static images and videos by slightly adjusting content to anonymize persons, text, and other sensible sources. In this work, we will discuss how this process can be applied to the presentation and dissemination of results with respect to privacy issues resulting from eye-tracking experiments."

In this paper, we reanalyze how eye-related information affected the detection performance of a previous study to develop better intent detection systems in the future. Specifically, we analyzed two aspects of dimensionality reduction and adaptation to different tasks. The results showed that saccade and fixation are not always useful, and the direction of gaze movement could potentially cause overfitting."

To measure cognitive workload, researchers have developed tools such as the wavelet analysis-based index of cognitive activity (ICA) and index of pupil activity (IPA). However, it is still unclear whether these tools can accurately measure workload during motor tasks. This study aims to investigate whether the IPA can differentiate task workload during a motor task involving aiming in a tele-operation setting, where the task requirements were quantified using Fitts’ index of difficulty(ID) based on target size and distance. The study found that the IPA can differentiate between different levels of motor task workload, provided the proper window is used, namely the period before the tool touches the targets. This finding is significant as it can aid in developing objective methods to evaluate task workload using pupil parameters during goal-directed movements."

To date, substantial research on the attentional and perceptual effects of gaze behavior has established four main forms of social eye gaze, and each form plays a role in establishing, grounding, and ensuring communication between interlocutors. However, while the perceptual effects of gaze on attentional and cognitive processes are well-elaborated, social and affective effects of gaze and, particularly, mutual gaze attracted little attention. The present review suggests that the mutual gaze has a unique role in social interactions since it has both perceptual and affective effects in social interaction, and the unique affective and social role of mutual gaze in real-time and naturalistic settings still needs further research."

Thirty-eight Hungarian L2 learners with B1 English language proficiency attended the online experiment to read and respond to the multimodal texts with IST and TSI relations. Furthermore, during the eye-tracking experiment, second language learners’ (N=9) gaze patterns were examined while reading IST and TSI multimodal texts. The initial study results reveal that while the semantic gap between the image and text encourages more intermodal interactions and longer eye fixations, redundancy, involving the duplication of information via image and text, also develops a strong mental model of the meaning. The present research may contribute to the development of a more comprehensive model of L2 multimodal and multimedia learning."

In our preliminary study, participants completed two image masking tasks in Adobe Photoshop based on real college-level course content. We then trained a machine learning model to predict student performance in each task based on data from other students, as a step towards offering automated student assistance and feedback to instructors. We reflect on the challenges and scalability issues to deploying such a system in-the-wild, and present some guidelines for future work."

Since each student has a different experience level, personal mood, or might be distracted by other scenarios the lecturers cannot keep track of all the individual students in a course but has to present the content more or less independently of the audience. In this paper we introduce work-in-progress that focuses on monitoring the students’ behavior in a course including the understanding of the presentation in terms of presentation speed. To reach this goal we make use of mobile eye tracking devices that permanently track the eye movements of the students paying visual attention to the lecturer’s slides. In the current state of the developed system we record two options, whether an individual student could follow and understand the slides or not while the summed up students’ feedback is reflected and displayed to the teacher in real-time, providing some kind of overview and avoiding asking questions permanently about the understanding of the slides’ contents. Finally, we will discuss challenges and limitations of our gaze-based monitoring system."

In order to better understand these transitions between different representations, we investigated possible eye-tracking indicators of cognitive load during a task that had two experimental conditions: one was purely mathematical, the other one was similar, but had a chemical context. We used pupil diameter, fixation duration, and pupil fluctuations as measured through the IPA as indicators of cognitive load. Our preliminary results indicate that there may not be a significant difference in cognitive load between the two conditions, which in turn suggests that a chemical context does not impose additional cognitive load on participants. The present study may serve as a starting point to investigate this issue further and shed light on the potential influence of a chemical context on cognitive load."

The subjects’ task is to review six short code examples in C programming language and identify possible errors. During the experiment, their eye movements are recorded by an SMI 250 REDmobile. Additional data is collected through questionnaires and retrospective interviews. The results implicate that holistic models of image perception provide a suitable theoretical background for the analysis and interpretation of eye movements during code reviews. The assumptions of these models are particularly evident for expert programmers. Their approach can be divided into different phases with characteristic eye movement patterns. It is best described as switching between scans of the code example (global viewing) and the detailed examination of errors (focal viewing)."

In this research work, we conducted an experiment using common fundamental programming questions on 66 undergraduate computer science students to study the gaze behavior among the novices (high and low performing) on programming comprehension. We aim to better understand the navigation behavior between groups of high and low performers’ common scanpaths generated by STA and whether Hierarchical Cluster Analaysis (HCA) can cluster these common scanpaths for high- and low-performing individuals across different stimuli. Findings suggest that the STA algorithm is a technique to consider to find common representative scanpaths of a group of individuals, however, HCA with relative Levenshtein distance metric alone may not be suitable to cluster high and low performers groups for varying numbers of AOIs across different stimuli."
