        "abstract": "The voltage source inverter is mainly used for grid interfacing of distributed generation systems. In order to boost the voltage of a renewable energy source to the required dc voltage level, a dc-dc converter is necessary even though the cost and complexity of the system are increased. Thus, in improving the cost and life expectancy of the power electronic interface, a current source inverter is an alternative which offers short-circuit protection capabilities, implicit voltage boosting and a simple ac-side filter structure. However, it has attracted less research attention since it is purported to have drawbacks in term of high conduction losses and inefficient inductive energy storage on its dc-side. With reference to advantages and disadvantages of both inverter types, this paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis with respect to the topological and operational features of the inverters. The comparison includes the power circuit, semiconductor constraints, cost, dc input filtering, steady-state, transient performance and power semiconductor losses. The analytical expectations of the systems are verified using MATLAB/ Simulink software package.",

        "abstract": "In LTE-Advanced, a heterogeneous network where femtocells and picocells overlaid onto macrocells is extensively discussed in addition to traditional well-planned macrocell deployment to improve further the system throughput. In heterogeneous network deployment, cell selection as well as intercell interference coordination (ICIC) is very important to improve the system and cell-edge throughput. Therefore, this paper investigates three cell selection methods associated with ICIC in heterogeneous networks in the LTE-Advanced downlink: signal-to-interference plus noise power ratio (SINR)-based cell selection, reference signal received power (RSRP)-based cell selection, and reference signal received quality (RSRQ)-based cell selection. Simulation results (4 pico eNodeBs and 25 set of user equipment are uniformly located within 1 macro eNodeB) assuming full buffer model show that the downlink cell and cell-edge user throughput levels of RSRP-based cell selection are degraded by approximately 3% and 10% compared to those of SINR-based cell selection under the condition of the maximizing the cell-edge user throughput due to the impairment of the interference level. Furthermore, it is shown that the downlink cell-edge user throughput of RSRQ-based cell selection is improved approximately 5%, although the cell throughput is degraded approximately 5% compared to that for SINR-based cell selection under the condition of the maximizing the cell-edge user throughput.",

Traditional LB schemes mainly focus on the load reduction of the hot-spot cell, while some partner cells might suffer from aggravating load after receiving inappropriate traffic, which triggers ripple LB and reduces the LB efficiency. To deal with this problem, a self- optimizing LB scheme in fixed relay station (RS) cellular networks is proposed. In the scheme, partner cells share the load jointly to guarantee each partner has similar load after LB. Meanwhile, the partner response mechanism considers the resources usage of partner's RSs to further reduce the ripple LB. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the number of ripple LB and reduce the call blocking rate.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach of visual SLAM using line segments as primitives. We choose Plucker lines to represent spatial lines and derive a novel fast line projection function based on the relationship between Pl̈ucker line and Plucker matrix. During normal SLAM procedure, the Near by Line Tracking (NLT) method is adopted to track lines and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to predict and update the state of the camera and line landmarks. After each update step, a robust spatial line reconstruction algorithm is used to find new line landmarks and to add them into the map. The SLAM procedure is under supervision and when failure is detected, a recovery method based on the angle histogram of key frames is adopted to relocalize the camera and re-start the SLAM procedure. We demonstrate that our monocular SLAM system is robust to illumination change, partial occlusion and fast camera motion.",

A common practice in the VSI-based inverter analysis is the assumption of a constant voltage type input source even in case of renewable energy sources. An input-voltage-controlled converter, as usually in PV applications, is always a current-fed topology. This paper reveals that in order to analyse the dynamic properties of three-phase inverters with scientific accuracy, the true nature of the input source is of utmost importance to be taken into account.",

Method - Based on guidelines for this specific type of study, we replicated the original study protocol. Results - The combination of manual and automatic searches retrieved 6,534 papers, of which 53 relevant papers were selected for data extraction and analysis. Conclusions - Studies address motivation using several viewpoints and approaches and, even though the number of researches increased in this area, the overall understanding of what actually motivates software engineers does not seem to have significantly advanced in the last five years.",

To ensure appropriate power quality and stability of the grid these problems should be recognized and solved.

In this paper fault current contribution from large scale photovoltaic (PV) power plant as well as protection issues concerning such DGs are discussed. The mentioned problems were investigated in PSCAD model of 50 MW grid-connected PV power plant where various operating condition of the network and penetration levels of PV were considered.",

        "abstract": "The characteristic behaviour of physically compact, multi terminal DC networks under electrical fault conditions can produce particularly demanding protection requirements. This represents a significant barrier to more widespread adoption of DC power distribution for microgrid applications. Whilst a number of methods have been proposed in the literature for such networks, which are based around the use of non-unit protection, there are limitations to the levels of fault discrimination which can be achieved. To illustrate the challenges in effectively implementing non-unit protection, this paper analytically describes the current, voltage, di/dt, dv/dt and impedance profiles of a representative network, with particular emphasis on the response for varying fault resistances. The paper highlights that the non-unit methods analysed are sub-optimal where fault location is required to be discriminated over the transient period after fault inception. Therefore, it is concluded that to achieve high levels of fault discrimination within future DC microgrid systems, more robust protection approaches are required.",

It is based on changing the phase of multiple resonators that behave as phase shifter. This technique brings a much higher reliability than for the actual absence/presence of resonance encoding way. The design proposed is based on 5 reflective strip resonators having resonant frequency starting from 2.5 GHz to 6.5 GHz. A capacity of 10 bits is reached within a reduced size of 20 × 40 mm2.",

A 4-terminal prototype microgrid comprising a grid connected VSC, a wind generator, an energy storage system, and DC loads is established to demonstrate the excellent operation performance of the proposed control system during various operating conditions such as load step, islanding, grid reconnection, and load shedding.",

Compared with a fixed-bias PA that consumes a constant dc power of 265 mW, the proposed PA saves 157 mW at quiescent state and 88 mW when operated at P1dB 6-dB back-off, and the OP1dB of the PA is also extended. This is the first CMOS PA with effective enhancement in back-off efficiency near MMW region.",

Two techniques have been adopted in the literature for implementing such hill-climbing algorithms: reference voltage perturbation where a reference value for the PV generator output voltage is used as the control parameter and direct duty ratio perturbation where the duty ratio of the MPPT converter is used directly as the control parameter. This paper presents a detailed comparison between these two techniques on the basis of system stability. Practical results obtained using a 540Wp PV experimental setup with a resistive load show very good agreement with the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "Integration of wind power may enhance the performance of power systems. This paper presents the impacts of wind power penetration on the operation of a radial distribution power system. A 37-bus radial system is studied. Continuation power flow (CPFLOW) is performed on the system without wind power and with gradually increasing a rate of wind power penetration. The wind turbine is connected to bus 35 which is the weakest bus. The wind turbine is modelled in as PQ generator, as the wind park is typically regulated with constant power factor. Voltage stability for the radial power system is determined by the corresponding PV curves for each bus with and without wind power. The effects of wind power penetration on the active power losses of the whole system as well as the voltage collapse with loading parameters are investigated. Changing the power factor by connecting a parallel capacitor is also considered. The simulation analysis was performed by PSAT/MATLAB simulation package. The analysis shows the benefits of introducing wind power to radial distribution systems by decreasing the active power losses and hence increasing the system efficiency. Voltage collapse was found to occur at higher loading factor which enhances the voltage stability of the system. Finally, the steady state bus voltages became higher than without wind penetration.",

The method uses Otsu method, obtained by pre-segmentation threshold value; then the image is divided into target and background. At last we use fuzzy partition method for final segmentation threshold. The experimental results show that the method can keep a greater degree of image detail.

The wind turbine DG supplies real power and in turn absorbs the reactive power. This paper proposes the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to find the optimal placement of wind turbine DG in the primary distribution system to reduce the real power losses and improvement in voltage profile. The results are verified with analytical approach which uses analytical expressions of wind turbine characteristics for proper deployment of the DG unit and the effects on system performance are investigated. In the first segment, the optimal size of wind-based DG is calculated at each bus using the exact loss formula and in the second segment the optimal location of DG is found by using the least loss method. The proposed technique is tested on standard 33-bus and 69-bus test systems.",

In this work, the 2D map of environment is built based on two colors, red and black, where the red represents the obstacles and the black represent the free spaces. The obstacle avoidance is performed when the RLF detects the red areas with the measured distance is less than 1m. The simulator can be used as offline and online tool for mobile robots. In 2009, it was used to offline test obstacle avoidance algorithms in some areas of 1km course of robot challenge named \"Tsukuba Challenge\" and online predict the robot trajectory in the next few meters during the autonomous navigation. As the results, our mobile robot completed the 1km course with the total time of 51m07s.",

Of particular interest is LTE-Advanced support for various M2M service requirements and efficient management and handling of a huge number of machines as mobile subscribers. In addition to the higher throughput, one of the main advantages of LTE/LTE-A in comparison with the previous cellular networks is the reduced transmission latency, which makes this type of networks very attractive for real-time mobile M2M communication scenarios. This paper presents a M2M system architecture based on LTE/LTE-A and highlights the delays associated with each part of the system. Three real-time M2M applications are analyzed and the main latency bottlenecks are identified. Proposals on how the latency can be further reduced are described.",

This framework outlines a set of building blocks which are necessary for carrying out the economic analysis of various BS applications. Further, special focus is given on describing how to use the rainflow cycle counting algorithm for battery cycle life estimation, since the cycle life plays a central role in the economic analysis of BS. To illustrate the modelling framework, a case study using a Sodium Sulfur Battery (NAS) system with 5-minute regulating service is performed. The economic performances of two dispatch scenarios, a so called naive scenario and a risk-averse scenario, are evaluated in this case study.",

Considering the environmental impacts that grow from the emissions produced by fossil-fuelled power plant, the economic dispatch that minimizes only the total fuel cost can no longer be considered as single objective. Artificial bee colony algorithm strategy based on mathematical modeling to solve economic, emission and combined economic and emissions dispatch problems by a single equivalent objective function. Artificial bee colony algorithm has been applied to two realistic systems at different load condition. Results obtained with proposed method are compared with other techniques presented in literature. ABC algorithm is easy to implement and capable of searching near global optimum solution at fast convergence and efficiency.",

The wind generators considered are the squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG), which is fixed speed, the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and the direct driven synchronous generator (DDSG) which are variable speed. Studies were conducted on a standard five machine, 14-bus system augmented by a radially connected wind power plant (WPP), which contains 215 wind turbine generators (WTG).The studies include examining the voltage magnitude, loading margin and voltage collapse of the system. These studies are conducted for the normal state as well as for line contingencies. It is found that large scale integration of WTG (direct drive synchronous generator) at the transmission level has the potential to improve the long term voltage stability of the grid by injecting reactive power.",

        "abstract": "Current wind turbine (WT) studies focus on improving their reliability and reducing the cost of energy, particularly when they are operated offshore. WT Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems contain alarm signals providing significant important information. Pattern recognition embodies a set of promising techniques for intelligently processing WT SCADA alarms. This paper presents the feasibility study of SCADA alarm processing and diagnosis method using an artificial neural network (ANN). The back-propagation network (BPN) algorithm was used to supervise a three layers network to identify a WT pitch system fault, known to be of high importance, from pitch system alarm. The trained ANN was then applied on another 4 WTs to find similar pitch system faults. Based on this study, we have found the general mapping capability of the ANN help to identify those most likely WT faults from SCADA alarm signals, but a wide range of representative alarm patterns are necessary for supervisory training.",

Joint-angle sensors on compliant joints provide an appealing option for this task. An algorithmic framework is presented that allows them to be used for contact detection and to determine object geometry without requiring tactile arrays or other complicated contact location sensors. This volumetric approach to using proprioceptive sensors provides improvements in accuracy over other existing approaches based on the intersection of planes and lines.",

        "abstract": "Small wind turbines (in the range 2-50kW) harvest wind energy to provide carbon free energy for residential and small commercial applications and remote or developing economies. Current state-of-the art technologies generally utilize simple diode bridge rectification of the output from brushless permanent magnet (PM) generators and grid connection via DC-DC converters and voltage source inverters. Such simplified systems do not utilize the full capacity of the generator, power conversion electronics and therefore the turbine due, in part, to inappropriate or simplified control but also generator over-design for protection/safety reasons. This paper presents a different approach to the design procedure for a wind turbine generator drive system that actively controls the generator upto and above the system base speed imposed by the (electrical) supply voltage constraint. The paper demonstrates the impact of wind generator power characteristics over the annual energy production. In addition, it shows the reasons for field weakening control of a PM generator, that is verified experimentally using a market available system.",

Since 2007, IEEE 802.15 Task Group 6 has been working on a communication standard for low power devices and operation on, in, or around the human body. We consider an IEEE 802.15.6 WBAN where wearable sensor devices are distributed on the body and have to send the measured data to a coordinator. Upon reception of a query coming from the coordinator, nodes of the WBAN compete to access the channel, using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance algorithm defined in the standard, for transmitting their data via a direct link. We evaluate network performance in terms of packet loss rate, delay, and throughput, through simulation. Two different channel models for on-body communication are considered. A comparison with a WBAN based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is also provided.",

In this paper we introduce a novel design technique for broadband high dynamic range absorptive voltage controlled attenuators (VCA) on SOI CMOS. The VCA design is based on the classical passive FET ‘Pi’ and ‘Tee’ attenuator structures but uses stacked FET techniques to dramatically improve the signal handling capability. The VCA has 30 dB attenuation range over a frequency range from DC to 5GHz and achieves an IIP3 of greater than +47 dBm over the entire analog control range.",

In this paper, fingerprint extraction from various surfaces using visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging for forensic applications is explored. Firstly, spectral analysis is conducted, where principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to determine the most informative linear band combinations of the hypercube. Then, based on the fingerprint quality index measurement, the optimal principal component is determined to have the highest quality score. Accordingly, the fingerprint image is also enhanced due to the effect of PCA. Comprehensive experimental results are reported and analysed.",

        "abstract": "As demand for renewable energy generation increases, the demand for power inverters with voltage buck-boost capability is also expected to rise. This is because the output of renewable energy sources such as solar panel, wind turbines etc are not constant due to varying climatic as well as geographic conditions. So in order to obtain an ac supply with adjustable voltage and frequency, a multi level inverter with buck boost capability is proposed. Multi-level converters are power-conversion systems composed by an array of power semiconductors and capacitive voltage sources that, when properly connected and controlled, can generate a multiple step voltage waveform with variable and controllable frequency, phase, and amplitude. In this a three level neutral point clamped inverter topology is used. Normally a neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter has a disadvantage of input capacitor voltage unbalancing. This can also be avoided by a special arrangement of input capacitors. Alternate Phase Opposition Disposition (APOD) modulation scheme is used for the modulation of NPC bridge. This inverter is used to drive a three phase induction motor. Simulation works are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) is combination of two or more energy sources with complementary characteristics formed to provide solution to a particular energy problem. Battery together with Ultracapacitor makes an excellent HESS for electric vehicles. However, it requires proper interface electronics and its control to get the desired benefits like longer driving range, better acceleration performance, controlled regenerative braking, smaller battery pack and longer battery life. The work presented in this paper tries to minimize the stresses on battery, present during periods of acceleration and braking of PMDC traction motor by adding ultracapacitor in parallel as an auxiliary power source. Unidirectional and bidirectional DC-DC converters are used with battery and ultracapacitor respectively to ensure proper energy flow to (and from) motor during different stages of driving cycle. State space averaging technique is used to model the converters. The power management algorithm intelligently divides the current demanded by motor between battery and ultracapacitor current The control strategy uses classical controllers, which are designed using bode plot based technique. The simulation is done on MA TLAB/SIMULINK.",

        "abstract": "Future Smart Grid applications rely on highly reliable and secure connectivity between various infrastructure components from utilities, grid operators and households in order to cover requirements on communications for smart metering and decentralized energy management including electric mobility. Therefore several approaches for communication infrastructures are currently discussed based on different architectural concepts including wired and wireless access and inhouse communication technologies. In this paper we provide an overview on wireless-enabled networking architectures and discuss two exemplary network planning approaches. On one hand, network planning algorithms for the neighbourhood area network (NAN) are introduced. On the other hand, we present results for an integrated, wireless network coverage-aware planning of public and private charge point locations. In addition we address in the paper the design and implementation of embedded, wirelessWeb Services to enable the efficient and reliable data exchange within distributed energy systems. The paper concludes with the comparison of two approaches for the optimal coding of energy-management-related SOAP messages.",

        "abstract": "One of the challenging issues with high voltage network connections, be it for off-shore windfarms, inter-network HVDC connections, or simply overhead line replacement is to test the complete connections before bringing them into service. Even if all components are individually tested before being brought onto the construction site the final assembly needs to tested as a complete system before it is put in service. There are currently several challenges in the area of testing 150KV and higher voltages: First for short length cables the cost of measurement is prohibitive due to the fact that most current testing equipment is designed for laboratory use, requires specialized and time consuming setup and is therefore uneconomical to use. Another challenging area is the testing of long cables completely assembled: Current testing technology requires multiple test systems to be interconnected, resulting in severe logistics and technical challenges and even then most time testing is done in sections. Furthermore for HVDC and voltages above 400kV testing is limited to laboratory tests mainly by lack of appropriate testing equipment and standards. A new technology development has promising capacities for these field testing needs: Differential Resonance Technology (DRT) is developed based on long years of experience in VLF field testing and before that specialised laboratory test equipment. Differential resonance technology, as the name describes uses the differential of 2 resonance circuits to create a high-voltage low frequency signal in the range from 0,1 Hz to 10Hz. In this way compact and powerful testing equipment for High and Ultra High voltage and DC can be constructed. Current status: the first prototype systems have been build, currently tested up to 200kV RMS, and the current product range goes from 100KV up to 400",

It is a subject area combining wireless body-area networks (WBANs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs). Body-centric wireless communications has abundant applications in personal healthcare, smart home, personal entertainment and identification systems, space exploration and military. The human body is an uninviting and often hostile environment for a wireless signal. In general, antennas suffer from reduced efficiency due to electromagnetic absorption in human tissues, radiation pattern fragmentation and variations in impedance at the feed. Typical geometries of wireless wearable and implantable devices, vary from millimetric to centimetric sizes and, hence, compact yet efficient antennas need to be fully characterized and integrated with the RF transceiver. As well as size there are other significant challenges in the design of antennas for body-centric wireless communications. The objective of this talk is to highlight current and emerging research in antennas and propagation for body-centric wireless communications, as well as applications of this technology.",

Method-A previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009) has been updated and extended to identify the current state of research on the mentioned topic. Results Eight studies applied SPI techniques or models to small and medium Web companies. The selected studies did not suggest any customized model or technique to measure the SPI of small and medium Web companies. The characteristics of some small and medium companies such as tight budget constraints, tight deadlines and a short term strategy were also identified. The measures of success for small and medium Web companies, as per SR results, include development team and client satisfaction, increase in productivity, compliance with standards and overall operational excellence. Conclusions-The results of this review, like our previously conducted systematic review (Sulayman and Mendes, 2009), show that very few studies have specifically focused on SPI for Web companies, despite the large number of existing Web companies worldwide, and the even larger number of Web applications being currently developed. This clearly indicates a research gap in this area, with numerous avenues for future work.",

        "abstract": "Detecting and recognizing people is important in surveillance. Many detection approaches use local information, such as pattern and colour, which can lead to constraints on application such as changes in illumination, low resolution, and camera view point. In this paper we propose a novel method for estimating the 3D head region based on analysing the gait motion derived from the video provided by a single camera. Generally, when a person walks there is known head movement in the vertical direction, regardless of the walking direction. Using this characteristic the gait period is detected using wavelet decomposition and the heel strike position is calculated in 3D space. Then, a 3D gait trajectory model is constructed by non-linear optimization. We evaluate our new approach using the CAVIAR database and show that we can indeed determine the head region to good effect. The contributions of this research include the first use of detecting a face region by using human gait and which has fewer application constraints than many previous approaches.",

This paper proposes a novel MPPT method which aims to circumvent traditional searching algorithms thus increasing the speed and accuracy of the response to varying irradiation levels. The method will be validated through MATLAB-SIMULINK simulations.",

This paper investigates the research questions raised by the proposed development of a wave farm using coastal WECs, where the spatial layout of the WECs is restricted and cannot be used to damp the fluctuations in generated power. The concept of using energy storage on a common DC link to compensate for the fluctuations in real power, and ensure that the power quality on a weak, rural distribution network is not compromised, will also be discussed.",

An armature controlled 1 HP separately excited DC motor driven by a thyristor DC drive with closed loop cascaded PI controller is used to emulate the characteristics of the rotor of small wind turbine. The DC motor is loaded by a separately excited DC generator. A small cheap analog electronic circuit with less interfacing is designed and implemented to emulate the governing equation of a small wind turbine rotor. This circuit generates a specific reference rotor speed based on the wind turbine rotor characteristics and the mechanical wind power available based on the wind speed. Modelling, simulation and experimental results are presented.",

This paper focuses on the derivation of an enhanced transmission-line model allowing us to describe a realistic microwave interconnect with the inclusion of external uncertainties. The proposed method, based on the expansion of telegraph equations in terms of orthogonal polynomials, turns out to be accurate and more efficient than alternative solutions like the Monte Carlo method. An application example involving the analysis of Sparameters of a realistic PCB coplanar waveguide concludes the paper.",

Expressions are derived for the complementary autocorrelation functions of signals affected by these impairments. The circularity of the received waveform is shown to hold in the presence of transmitter I/Q imbalance and other impairments under certain realistic and non-restrictive conditions, while receiver I/Q imbalance makes the signal non-circular. These findings are important for receiver I/Q imbalance compensation, since many of these algorithms rely on the circularity of the received waveform, either explicitly or implicitly. Receiver DC offsets can potentially make the signal noncircular, but the effect is shown to be insignificant under realistic RF-to-LO isolation values. The results build confidence that low-complexity blind receiver I/Q imbalance compensation is applicable even in the presence of transmitter I/Q imbalances and other system impairments.",

This work presents a concept to design a compact planar multiharmonic load transformation network (MHLTN) for the realisation of highly efficient dual-band PAs. The proposed MHLTN consisting of only transmission lines can precisely achieve impedance terminations at two distinct frequencies including up to three harmonics. High-impedance stubs are deliberately inserted at particular sections of the network for harmonic termination control. PA measurements show 78.4 % and 61.3 % peak PAE.",

This phenomenon can lead to over- and undervoltages in some nodes of the line. In this paper, consumers will be considered as partially interruptible loads. By curtailing opportune loads, a smoother voltage profile can be obtained. The aim of this paper is to create a curtailment schedule that takes into account both the voltage profile along the line as well as the demands of the consumers. The use of binary particle swarm optimization will be investigated to obtain this demand side management (DSM) system.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the activity of the facial blood vessels of drunk persons is studied using thermal infrared images. Nonlinear anisotropic diffusion is applied to enhance the vessels on the images and after that top-hat transformation is used for isolating them from the rest information on the face. Simple thresholding is applied to raise the more active vessels. Registration procedures are employed to easily compare the vessel activity on the face of the drunk person with that on the sober person. In drunk persons, vessels around nose and eyes as well as on the forehead become more active. This work constitutes a preliminary study, which aims at qualitative and not quantitative results. Basically, the restricted number of the 20 persons that participated in the experiment is not considered adequate for statistical inference.",

By connecting a closed loop to the LWA on the drain side of the distributed amplifier, we can obtain gain enhancement compared to the one directly terminated without the loop. Such enhancement fluctuates with respect to the frequency. The phenomenon will be explained theoretically and validated through the measurement and simulation in this paper.",

Such a heuristic approach starts from the result of a deterministic optimal power flow problem, then converts all the chance constraints into equivalent deterministic constraints through probabilistic power flow calculations, and further verifies the satisfaction of these equivalent constraints. If some violation happens, the corresponding constraint bounds are modified according to a heuristic strategy and an updated deterministic optimal power flow problem is solved again. This process is repetitively run until no violation of constraints exists. Case studies on a modified IEEE 118-bus system are presented and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic stochastic optimal power flow approach.",

        "abstract": "When planning power system operation it is important to have reliable models of the elements of the power system. Fixed speed wind turbines are a widely installed generation technology that use a single squirrel cage induction generator. The local wind profile and the properties of the induction machine constitute the main considerations when modeling these wind turbines. Existing methods for estimating the parameter values of induction machine models use a wide variety of parameter estimation algorithms but primarily use active and reactive power measurements made during start-up or direct mechanical testing to fit the model to. Proposed here is a parameter estimation method that applies improved particle swarm optimization to active and reactive power measurements made during a deviation in system frequency to estimate the parameter values of a induction machine model. This method has shown good accuracy and the use of on-line data may prove beneficial in future applications.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide utilities and industries have seen various technological advancements in circuit breaker (CB) testing and analysing. Yet most of the owners underperform the maintenance activity when it comes to circuit breaker maintenance and many limit themselves to an operating time test or a static contact resistance test using inappropriate test equipment. The reasons cited for this were 'complicated test procedures which involve longer outage time on the feeder', 'lack of availability of the feeder for maintenance' and 'lack of permission to remove the earth rod or earth switch while the breaker was in shutdown condition'. Also the decision making process and pin pointing the fault in a breaker after performing a basic circuit breaker test will often be a challenge. Though the basic tests like timing test on a circuit breaker provides preliminary information about the breaker condition, actual condition of a deteriorating breaker becomes obvious in a well matured state and often revealed only by a catastrophic failure while in service. Different utilities, switch gear manufacturers, researchers and test equipment manufacturers have stressed the importance of various advanced test methodologies to save time and money. Those tests include coil current analysis, dynamic resistance measurement, testing on dual ground conditions, vibration testing, first trip analysis, online testing and so on. These circuit breaker testing technologies often provide critical information of the circuit breaker and make the decision making process simple. Pinpointing the fault in a circuit breaker and attempting the maintenance activity in a very short time will be complicated if the directions guided by the test methodologies or equipments are not clear enough or easy enough. Also one particular method, tool or technology will never provide",

        "abstract": "The sustainable security of energy supply, led both developed and developing countries to make and implement new policies to improve efficiency in energy consumption, to adopt new alternatives like renewable energy systems. To face the economic, social, technological and environmental challenges, the need for energy conservation as well as for developing renewable technologies has become even more critical. Hybrid systems can be considered as a reasonable solution, capable to support systems that cover the energy demands of both stand-alone and grid connected consumers. Commonly, it consists of a mix of two or more energy sources used jointly to provide increased system efficiency as well as greater balance in energy supply. The aim of this paper is to present the architecture of a Decision Support System (DSS) that can be used for the hourly energy management of a mix of renewable energy systems. Specifically, an integrated model representing a hybrid energy generation system (characterized by solar plate collector, PV, wind and battery storage) connected to the grid is developed. The approach is based on mathematical modelling of each component, then an optimization problem is solved in order to better manage and control the energy flow so to ensure reliable supply of demand.",

This paper presents a novel dual-band bandpass filter (BPF) using half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) technology for the first time. The proposed filter is at least six times smaller than its conventional substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) counterpart. A three-pole dual-band Chebyshev BPF with center frequencies of 1.05 GHz and 1.3 GHz is implemented on RT/Duroid 6010LM substrate. To our knowledge, this filter is the state-of-the-art in dual-band BPFs using SIW technology.",

        "abstract": "Voltage profile has been a major concern for power system utilities because of several events of voltage collapse in the recent past. Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices are increasingly used to improve voltage profile and power fl ow control in many utilities. However, owing to the considerable cost of FACTS devices involved, it is important to find the optimal location and sizing of these devices in a power system to obtain maximum benefits of these devices. For finding optimal location and sizing of Statcom in a power system, this paper investigates the application of various models of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. To compare the performance of various PSO algorithms, these were implemented for optimal location and sizing of Statcom for voltage profile improvement in a benchmark 5-bus system. Out of various PSO models: classical PSO, PSO time varying inertia weight (PSOTVIW), PSO random inertia weight (PSO-RANDIW) and PSO-Time varying acceleration coefficients (PSO-TVAC), PSO-TVAC model is found to be superior in terms of computation speed and quality of solution.",

        "abstract": "Most of the disturbance in the power system is nonlinear and no-stationary. Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is an efficient time-frequency analysis method which can detect different kinds of power quality disturbance. HHT consists of empirical-mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert transform (HT). EMD can self-adjust according to the characteristics of the signal itself, and decompose the signal into IMFs, so that the disturbance can be separated and studied. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), which improved the performance of EMD, overcomes the mode mixing phenomena which restrain the usage of EMD. This paper did a contrast study on power quality detection using EMD and EEMD. It is concluded that EEMD has better effect on detecting some of power quality disturbances.",

A new ATPDraw object, called ISF, has been developed with the aid of which insulator string flashover is modeled on the basis of several flashover models from literature. The ISF object was employed in ATP-EMTP simulations of a 150 kV GIS substation. The computed backflashover surges impinging on the substation vary considerably among the insulator string flashover models employed in simulations. The ISF object is a useful tool within the ATP-EMTP environment for insulation co-ordination studies. The effects of insulator string flashover modeling on backflashover surges arising at overhead transmission lines and impinging on the connected substations can be easily quantified.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control strategy for wind turbines to enhance their fault ride-through capability. The controller design is based on pitch controlled variable speed wind turbine equipped with doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The fault ride-through is realized by injecting a crowbar with variable resistance on the generator rotor circuit. To reduce the mechanical loads induced by grid faults, the wind turbine controller is improved by means of filtering techniques which alleviate the loads on the turbine blades and drive-train. The performance of the control strategy is tested by simulation. It is shown that the combined mechanical and electrical controller design significantly improves the wind turbine fault ride-through capability. The effects of the fault ride-through strategy on both the wind turbine and electric network are then analysed.",

The transformer-coupled design has about 15dB fundamental rejection over a slightly narrower bandwidth extending from 7-16 GHz.

In such active networks, extensive monitoring and remote control technologies are essential. Therefore, a State Estimation (SE) tool is the core component in future distribution management systems. Extensive research is ongoing with regard to the development of novel Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) tools for improved network monitoring and control. The novel DSSE tool is required to be scalable to fit into small to large size networks, operable with limited real time measurements and able to execute the computation of large volumes of data in a limited time. This paper proposes and develops a novel scalable DSSE tool that satisfies the requirements for present and future distribution network infrastructure and management systems. The proposed DSSE tool applies an emerging meta-heuristic optimization mechanism known as Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA). A detailed investigation is performed with various case studies related to expected scenarios of future distribution networks.",

In the proposed couplers, the proposed forward couplers are a balanced CRLH transmission lines simultaneously in even/odd modes. Thus, the proposed forward coupler has a wide-band characteristic. The proposed forward coupler is simulated and experimentally demonstrated in S-band. We have designed a 0 dB forward coupler and the bandwidth is 36.5% in the experiments.",

        "abstract": "Railways provide a better alternative to other modes of transport by being energy efficient since it can carry large number of people and goods at the same time. In the recent years, number of accident due to trains are more and the losses also heavy. The main reason for these accidents is irresponsibility of driver and signalling problems which results severe damage to life and property. We have proposed a new method called Intelligent Collision Avoidance System (ICAS) for avoiding frontal collision. This system avoids the collision in an efficient way by notifying the status of two trains in the same track when they are separated by three kilo meters. This is done by warning the driver both visually and by giving a sound alert. The ICAS will manage situations efficiently and notify the opposite train which is on the same track. We have designed a new vibration sensor for sensing the train on the track. Analyses of channel model for different geographical area are discussed. The prototype is designed using micro controller and tested successfully through wireless communication.",

It is a highly nonlinear complex optimization problem which requires a robust and effective solution technique for achieving global optimal solution efficiently. This paper proposes a principle component analysis based mutation operator for improving the performance of real coded genetic Algorithm to deal such type of problems. The proposed algorithm is tested for IEEE-57 bus system for optimal reactive power dispatch problem. The simulation results obtained are compared with various optimization methods available in literature.",

Traditional energy detection algorithm is bad in anti-noise. In this paper, the detection performance of one node with fixed single threshold and double threshold is investigated firstly in the circumstances of noise average power with constant and fluctuation in short time. Detection performance is sensitive to noise. To the characteristic, new energy detection algorithms based on cooperative and dynamic threshold are presented. Simulations show that the proposed schemes outperform traditional algorithms, and cooperative detection is optimal. Cooperative detection scheme improved antagonism of noise average power fluctuation in short time and got a good detection performance as long as increasing the number of cooperative users. In other words, the proposed scheme enhanced the robust of against noise and improved the capacity of spectrum sensing.",

The third-order intermodulation distortion of the proposed NMOS device is improved by 15 dB as compared to the conventional single device. With the linearization, the measured IMD3 is enhanced by 14 dB, and the adjacent channel power ratio of the amplifier is improved by 7 dB.",

A flexible and suitable mathematic model is introduced to characterize the smart charging behavior and detailed parameters needed for charging behavior of an individual EV are analyzed. The individual charging schedule is extended to the EV fleet. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

In order to transfer maximum power, input voltage of the inverter has to be controlled in addition to grid current control, resulting in cascaded input-output-control scheme. For proper modelling, the input-source characteristics and the input voltage control cannot be omitted. It is observed that the cascaded-control scheme produces negative-resistor-like behaviour at the inverter output, which is amplified by the multiplier-based grid synchronization. The negative impedance makes the inverter prone to instability and the utility grid for harmonic resonances.",

Voltage control areas are important for efficient reactive power management in power systems operating under deregulated environment. Voltage control areas formed using conventional hierarchical clustering based method is already presented in literature and used for efficient reactive power management The present paper investigates the capability of K-means clustering for the purpose of identifying voltage control areas. The proposed method is tested and compared for IEEE 24 bus RTS and IEEE 30 bus system. The results show that this K-means based method is competing with conventional hierarchical approach.",

This paper investigates the effect of a fractional-order Proportional plus Integral plus Derivative (FOPID) controller in automatic generation control (AGC) of interconnected two unequal and three unequal area thermal systems considering appropriate generation rate constraint (GRC). Integral square error (ISE) criteria have been used as performance index to design the optimal controller keeping frequency bias setting fixed at frequency response characteristics. The performance of FOPID controller is investigated and compared with several integer-order (10) classical controllers such as integral (I), Proportional plus Integral (PI), Proportional plus Integral plus Derivative (PID). The optimum value for several parameters is obtained using classical approach minimising cost function J. Studies reveal that FOPID controller having five tuning knobs are quite robust and provide superior dynamic performances in terms of settling time and reduction in oscillation of frequency and tie line power deviation dynamic response as compared to all the conventional 10 controllers. System performances are examined with 1% step load perturbation in ureal.",

In this work we propose a new graph-based sub-channel assignment scheme for downlink multi-cell OFDMA networks. Our scheme consists of two phases, both of which are formulated as graph problems. The first phase is location-aware interference management, including inter-cell interference coordination (IOC) as well as intra-cell interference avoidance. The second phase is channel-aware sub-channel assignment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the system throughput while maintaining user-Quality of Service (QoS) compared with existing sub-channel assignment schemes.",

In particular we outline the possible interference management techniques defined in the standard. We present a distributed and centralized interference management strategy operating in the frequency domain. We evaluate the presented strategies for a dense deployment with closed subscriber groups and a scenario where multiple operators share the same band. Our results show that the distributed scheme performs similar to the centralized scheme and that both schemes outperform reuse one.",

        "abstract": "Continuously increasing electrical demand, together with national renewable energy targets, has resulted in an increase in the amount of renewable generation being connected to the bulk power system. Therefore, the existing transmission/distribution network becomes the critical limiting factor which may constrain generation during arduous loading condition and/or system contingency. Due to the difficulties in obtaining permission for network expansion, a possible solution is to maximize the utilization of existing network by employing dynamic line rating (DLR), which determines line ampacity based on real time weather conditions. Based on the weather and loading data collected from Northern Ireland Electricity Network, the extra power facilitated by DLR is quantified. Then, the impact of uprating transmission lines on a power system is tested on both the IEEE Reliability Test System and a single line representation. Finally, the improvement using DLR on load flow calculations is introduced, which takes into account the temperature dependent line resistance for the power system load flow calculations.",

        "abstract": "The strategies involved in scheduling generators and reliability management of power system is changing rapidly due to restructuring of power system. This paper critically reviews the reliability impacts of solar integrated thermal power plants and DR management. DR refers to the actions taken by the Independent system operator (ISO) to respond to a shortage of supply for a short duration of time, thereby maintaining the system reliability by scheduling spinning reserves. This paper presents a Binary real coded firefly (BRCFF) algorithm for solving Security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem for the hybrid power system incorporating reliability constraints. The Loss of load probability (LOLP) is the reliability index used for evaluating the system reliability level. The evaluation of the reliability index includes both unavailability of thermal generator units and unavailability of Solar cell generators (SCG). The proposed methodology is tested and validated on an IEEE RTS 24 bus system.",

        "abstract": "Concurrent cooperative transmission (CCT) is a cooperative transmission (CT) technique, also known as distributed transmit diversity, where a collection of single-antenna nodes induce a signal-to-noise-ratio advantage in a receiver by transmitting multiple copies of the same message, at the same time, in multiple diversity channels. CCT has been considered in many physical layer system studies including realistic demonstrations, which presented cooperative diversity gain in terms of error rate improvement or range extension. However, there have been very few attempts to evaluate CCT-based network routing schemes on a testbed with consideration of the overheads and challenges that CCT poses to the higher layers. In this paper, we compare the OLAROAD cooperative routing protocol with the conventional Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol, on an ad hoc network of software defined radios. OLAROAD is based on a physical layer that forms opportunistic large arrays (OLAs). We evaluate the performance of the protocols on a linear network topology in a typical office building in terms of hop count, round trip time, packet delivery ratio and route discovery time, so that the advantages and disadvantages of CCT-based routing algorithm may be observed.",

In the space domain, the fields at the collocation points are expanded into a series of new Shepard functions and are treated with a meshless method procedure. In comparison with the traditional schemes of the meshless methods, this approximation function has lower computational cost with same level of accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents control strategies with specific control targets designed for generator- and grid-side voltage-sourced converters (VSCs) of wind turbines with permanent magnetic synchronous generator (WT-PMSGs) as well as those for rectifier- and inverter-side VSCs of multi-terminal VSC HVDC (MTDC) transmission system. With the proposed coordination control of VSCs in the WT-PMSGs and VSC HVDC system, the dynamic stability of the whole offshore wind energy system can be maintained under large disturbances. Then the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method is proposed for tuning controller parameters of VSCs to improve the dynamic performances of the whole energy system. Finally, case studies for transient stability analysis are carried out to validate the proposed coordinated control strategy and parameters tuning by PSO method. In the testing system, two offshore wind farms and one AC power grid are interconnected as the meshed structure via the 3-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system. The digital simulations are carried out with Matlab/Simulink.",

Based on the characteristics of the DV-Hop, which is a very typical range-free localization algorithm , an improved scheme is proposed in this paper. Simulation results indicate that this algorithm can effectively improve the DV-Hop positioning accuracy without adding too much computing.",

        "abstract": "Type 1 inband relay nodes and time-division transmit and receive advanced relay stations are to be supported by 3GPP LTE-Advanced and IEEE 802.16m, respectively. Both classifications support a similar relaying mode where the relay link transmission is time- division multiplexed with the access link transmission, whereas macro users share the same resources with the relays. Hence, system performance depends strongly on the resource partitioning strategy among and within the links as well as how well the competition on resources is managed at the donor eNB. In this paper, we present performance evaluation of different schemes for resource sharing among relay nodes and prioritization techniques of relay users on the relay link coupled with the corresponding scheduling on the access link. In particular, we propose a combination of resource sharing based on the number of relay users and relay link prioritization and scheduling of relay users achieving max-min fairness. A comprehensive system-level simulation campaign is carried out in 3GPP urban and suburban models considering 4 and 10 relays per cell. Results show that the proposed scheme achieves high system fairness and significant throughput gains at the low and mid throughput regime at no or negligible loss in cell throughput.",

The time varying nature of intermittent wind generation acts as a continuous disturbance to the power system.

        "abstract": "The use of renewable generation and energy storage with actively managed curtailment schemes is investigated. A heuristic optimisation algorithm is presented that maximises the revenue available to the operator of a storage system that time-shifts curtailed generation, and trades by buying and selling power on an electricity market. The algorithm is applied to a case study of a distribution network curtailment scheme with a generic storage device. It is found that allowing a storage unit to both trade with the market, and time-shift curtailed generation generates greater revenue that operating in either mode individually. A Last-In-First-Out scheme of small wind farms in a curtailment scheme is modelled to show the effect of including storage. Finally it is noted that the role of renewable subsidies is important for the encouragement of efficient storage technologies.",

Many active distribution network management functions need accurate real-time estimates of the network state. In this paper, a distribution network state estimation algorithm is developed and used in conjunction with coordinated voltage control. The state estimator utilizes equality constrained weighted least squares optimization and includes bad data detection. The state estimator is tested with MATLAB simulations, real-time digital simulator and in a real distribution network.",

Many domestic and international experiences show that educational games play an important influence on the growth of young people. However, media reports and academic research information show that while educational games improve the learning interest of youth, it also has many problems such as non-scientific design of the games, unreasonable educational and teaching methods, unsatisfactory game result etc. In the future, youth learning can not be separated from educational games. The inevitable way of improving the effectiveness of educational games is to correctly understand the positive role of educational games, to set a reasonable goal, to design the scientific content, to enhance the effect evaluation, to feedback timely the information and to control thoroughly the way of educational games.",

Two voxel-based human body models with standing and walking posture were developed and integrated into simulation models to compute the current density distribution in the human body shocked by the step voltage. In order to speed up the transient simulation, the reduced c technique was used, leading to a speedup factor of around 20. In the paper, the trade-off between speedup and error when using the reduced c technique is discussed, and simulation results are presented in detail.",

In this paper, a star topology is used as the structure of network, and the microcontroller unit (MCU) as the main control device in base station and slave stations. Slave stations use SHT11 digital temperature and humidity sensor to complete data acquisition, and exchange data with base station by low-power multi-channel nRF905 transceiver chip. This paper introduces the hardware and software of the base station, using the communication protocol and frequency hopping (FH) mechanism to ensure the reliability of data transmission, increasing the robustness of the system. The result shows that this system has the advantage of portable, flexible arrangement, a large coverage area, low power consumption, and small disturbance, etc. The design is worth to be applied in practical applications.",

        "abstract": "The importance of transformer fault gas analysis and interpretation is well recognised and documented. However, unlike the diagnosis of human blood where rules have been well established, the diagnosis of faults in transformer oil is not so clearly defined. Whilst some transformer faults are straightforward to diagnose, with dissolved gas analysis (DGA) results pointing to the type and severity of fault, in many other cases it is often difficult to diagnose what type of transformer fault is involved and even harder to determine the cause. In some cases the transformer may be damaged but this may not be obvious from DGA results. This paper introduces the causes of transformer faults and failure; presents an overview of development of DGA diagnostics and discusses the merits and limitation of DGA diagnostic method; and describes five case examples, showing that knowledge from forensic inspection of faults and failures in transformers are of vital importance in understanding results from DGA of oil samples, and an in-depth understanding of the transformer design and life-limiting faults enable better interpretation of DGA results.",

        "abstract": "The control features of the ac/dc grid-side converters used to connect wind power systems with the grid are of significant importance for the overall grid performance. In this paper, the conventional PI controllers used in cascaded structure to regulate the dc voltage and the system power factor are analysed by using the well-known linear control theory. An alternative analysis, namely a nonlinear passivity based analysis, is conducted that results in some significant innovations for the controllers' design. These innovations lead to a simpler controllers' form than the conventional one since as it is proven, exact cancellation of the cross-coupling terms of the system as well as cancellation of the grid voltage component through the controllers' design are not required. The simulation results verify the proposed design approach since it enhances the system robustness and response.",

The DAC enables sampling rates up to 28 GS/s with a power consumption of 2.25 W at a −2.5 V power supply. The output bandwidth is at least 14 GHz. The integral nonlinearity (INL) and differential non-linearity (DNL) are 0.8 LSB and 1 LSB respectively. The estimated effective number of bit (ENOB) at 25 GS/s are 5.5-bit at DC and 4.6-bit at the Nyquist frequency.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents Cross Layer design Packet Scheduling Architecture (CLPSA) with added two functionalities for Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) Down Link (DL) transmission. The first function is service specific queue sorting algorithms for service level performance optimisation and second function is adaptive Time Domain (TD) prioritising algorithm for network level performance optimisation. The overall aim is to improve Quality of Service (QoS) of Real Time (RT) and Non Real Time (NRT) streaming video traffic by slightly delaying Best Effort (BE) traffic along with maintaining system throughput and user fairness at good level. The results show that proposed CLPSA significantly reduces delay and Packet Drop Rate (PDR) of RT traffic while satisfying minimum throughout requirement of NRT streaming video traffic. A good trade-off is achieved between system throughput and user fairness.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays the electromagnetic interference (EMI) causes a major problem in power electronic circuits particularly in high frequency application, this problem is more severe. There are a lot of techniques to reduce the EMI. But in higher frequency application the efficiency of other methods are low. In order to reduce the EMI in high frequency application the special technique called Chaotic PWM control method is used. This paper deals with the suppression of EMI in Boost converter. The result of this paper shows that Peak of the EMI will be reduced by the entire frequency band and also it reduces the entire range of frequency band. Simulation results are compared for the normal traditional PWM converter and analogue method of chaotic PWM pulse converter. ORCAD/PSPICE simulation tools are used to simulate the circuit. Here dc-dc converters are made to operate in chaotic mode, so that it can generate the spread spectra, which are used to mitigate EMI effectively. To analyze the spectrum, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method is used. Finally, the different simulation models are presented and with this simulation, one can able to analyze the effectiveness of reducing EMI in Boost converter circuit.",

It is shown that Graphene rotates the polarization of a perpendicularly-incident, linearly-polarized plane wave.

A new circular waveguide Graphene Faraday rotator with enhanced bandwidth and thermal characteristics is proposed.",

        "abstract": "With the rapidly increasing capacity of grid-connected wind power and the development of offshore wind power, the operating characteristics of wind turbine during the fault have drawn more concern. This paper adopts a relatively simple method to achieve low voltage ride-through (LVRT) of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbine. A thyristor controlled voltage regulator (TCVR) is installed in the low-voltage side of the wind farm substation. When voltage dip occurs, the grid-side voltage is reasonably compensated according to the degree it drops to improve the stator voltage of DFIG, thereby reducing the flux changes in amplitude, so that the rotor current is restricted under the limit and at the same time the over-voltage of DC bus during the fault is suppressed. A 5MW DFIG wind power system model with the proposed control strategy is established in PSCAD/EMTDC to simulate the operating characteristics of the wind turbine under severe symmetrical fault to verify the validity of the proposed method.",

It is impossible to carry out accurate numerical simulation of 3D transient electromagnetic processes within whole structure of the rotor because of huge computational expenses. Therefore, this paper is devoted to finite element analysis of electromagnetic processes in important structural parts of the rotor - joints of nonmagnetic slot wedges by the rotor length. Results will be used for computer simulation of thermal and vibration behaviour of the rotor.",

The results indicate that homogenizing treatment is conducive to microscopic structure of the alloy, the microstructure is fine and the heat conductivity is high after homogenizing treatment technology at 560 °C for 6 hours. The thermal conductivity of alloy material declines as solution temperature rises, strength and thermal conductivity reach better coordination at 510 °C. Artificial aging can renovate the defect of structure effectively and enhance heat conductivity, with aging system at 200 °C for 6 hours its thermal conductivity is excellent.",

        "abstract": "The wind power generation is experiencing a rapid growth, achieving the highest number of European installations in 2010 comparing to other renewable sources. The need for a smarter grid capable of integrating several decentralized sources of energy and the increasing need for energy in urban areas, has led to an increase interest in wind turbines for the urban areas. In these environments, vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) have several advantages over horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT), namely: their ability to operate closer to the ground; their insensitivity to yaw wind directions; the smaller number of components; the operation at low sound emissions; the ability to generate energy from wind in skew flow. One problem with the lift-type VAWT (Darrieus wind turbines) is their natural inability to self-start at low wind speeds without extra components. Hence, a new blade profile for Darrieus type VAWT is presented in this paper, capable to self-start at low wind speeds. A methodology is developed to compare the new blade profile with other known airfoils. Finally, conclusions are duly drawn.",

I chose the birth date of the \"Credit Suisse Information Bus\" 13 years ago as the starting point of a long journey towards an enterprise SOA at Credit Suisse. I have chosen a number of case studies, marking major steps in the SOA progress. Each case study starts with a strategic business need, continues with the chosen solution, and concludes with a discussion of the achievements and the remaining gaps. Putting these case studies into a historic perspective, shows a continuous evolution, where each step expands the business value, closes gaps of previous solutions, and last but not least leads to new challenges. I will illustrate each case study with examples and data.",

Using Visual C++ 6.0 as development platform , the digital simulation program was developed by Runge-Kutta method. Comparison between simulation result and test result indicates that there is a well consistency between simulation results and test results. Compared with the point contact tire model, the average error of body acceleration drops 26.88%. the average error of axle's acceleration drops 11.75%.",

An adaptive extended Kalman filter is proposed, which can filter the random drift error from inertial sensors, and also adaptively compensates external acceleration. External acceleration, which affects attitude estimation based on accelerometers, is a major source of attitude estimation error. The external acceleration error is compensated by adjusting the measurement noise covariance adaptively. The proposed algorithm is verified through experiments.",

        "abstract": "Detecting fall is a particular important task in security monitoring and healthcare applications of sensor networks. However traditional approaches suffer from either a high false positive rate or high false negative rate, especially when the collected sensor data are unbalanced. Therefore, there is a lack of tradeoff between false alarms and misses for many traditional data mining methods to be applied. To solve this problem a novel fall detection algorithm based on pattern recognition and human posture analysis is presented in this paper. It firstly extracts thirty temporal features from the original data traces for different length adaptation of samples, and then exploits Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to filter the noisy character data and reduce the dimension of feature vectors. After that, it performs a closer classification with one-class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to filter the high false positive samples, and finally applies posture analysis to counteract the effects of high false negative samples until a satisfying accuracy is achieved. Simulation with real data demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms other existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) are utilized nowadays in wind farms due to their advantages as compared with other corresponding ones. Control complexities and their unique dynamic characteristics may, however, raise different problems during abnormal or faulty operating conditions considering grid-supporting purposes. This results mainly from their fast control mechanisms, tight thermal limits of their IGBT inverters as well as the reaction of the associated rotor protection mechanisms. Accordingly, DFIGs show different grid-support profile as compared with either single fed induction generators or conventional synchronous ones. In this paper, the performance of DFIG units for grid faults is investigated. Detailed dynamic modeling of the DFIG units is utilized considering rotor protection circuitry with either crowbar or DC choppers. Scenarios for grid-supporting are explored. This facilitates realizing a better understanding of the real behavior of such generators and highlighting their features well in order to get a better utilization of wind energy resources in the future.",

The eigenvalue analysis is used to study distribution system behaviour under different operating conditions. Two-bus connected by asymmetrical line is used as the study system. The effects of both unbalance and extreme loading conditions are investigated. Also, the impact of distributed energy resources is studied. Different case studies and loading scenarios are presented to trace the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. The results exhibit the existence of a new bifurcation point which may not be related to the voltage stability.",

A face detection method based on corner verifying is presented. Firstly, most of the background area is quickly filtered out by skin color detection. Then faces are detected by AdaBoost face detection algorithm combination with skin color detection, but there are some non-faces to be detected. Finally, the faces are verified by corner distribution of human face after Harris corner detection to further reduce the error rate. Experimental results show that this method can efficiently and accurately detect the faces with multi-feature fusion.",

        "abstract": "Wind turbine generators are frequently subjected to lightning due to their locations and height. So, the performance of wind farm under such events is worthy investigated. This paper studies the surge propagation through wind farm when a lightning hits blade of one of the wind turbines. This study includes the problem of ground potential rise on the surge arrester operation. To carry out such analysis a reliable model of wind turbine is essential. For getting appropriate wind turbine model, a high frequency model of surge arrester protecting the boost transformer is used as well as high frequency model of this transformer is implemented. The impact of surge arrester and transformer model on back flow current-overvoltages are highly investigated in the time domain as well as frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and considering simple wind farm consisting of two wind turbines. Identification parameters of the low voltage (LV) arrester model are introduced including all voltage values of LV levels. The simulation is carried out using ATP/EMTP and MATLAB software. This study provides accurate modelling of wind farms under transients due to lightning.",

        "abstract": "As a primary way of data transmission in a large variety of cognitive radio systems, Non-Contiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NC- OFDM) is a specialized OFDM with non-contiguous sub-carriers. In general, an OFDM system is required to be strictly synchronized. However, one of the huge challenges is the synchronization for NC-OFDM because of the non-contiguous and unevenly distributed sub-carriers of uncertain number in the NC- OFDM. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive synchronization algorithm for NC-OFDM system. In the new scheme, the training sequence is produced adaptively from detected available sub-carriers, and timing metric for synchronization is determined by PN-modulation of the training sequence. The algorithm compensates the frequency offset due to the multi-path channel effect, and yields a single peak on timing metric. A satisfactory performance with regard to estimation on the timing and frequency offset, and to the bit error rate (BER) is shown by simulation.",

        "abstract": "Energy requirements continue increasing as the industrialisation spreads and the standards of living rise. Most of the world's power consumption is still generated from fossil fuels combustion which despite of its advanced development has only a maximum efficiency of about 50%, generates almost 35% of the greenhouse emissions, as well as becoming expensive and insecure with the recent instability of oil prices. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, micro-hydro, wave, geothermal, and biomass are potential solutions for clean energy problem, but still challenges exist. Britain's target to reduce carbon emissions by 32% by 2020 through producing up to 34% of electricity and 15% of all energy from renewables cannot be met unless the contribution of such intermittent energy sources becomes more effective. Storing energy harnessed from renewables using energy storage technologies allows integration of such intermittent weather dependent energy sources while balancing the grid. Hydrogen Energy storage technology is proposed here to enable the UK to utilise its vast, but intermittent renewable energy resources with increased reliance. The objective within this study is to evaluate this process which represents genuine energy carbon neutrality. Energy capacity and economic viability assessment of an existing wind/hydrogen energy system operating in conjunction with the grid is provided here as a case study.",

Stedin, a Dutch Distribution System Operator recognized the vital role that an Asset Management system has for its organization. Therefore, Stedin, has adopted the publicly available specification, BSLPAS55, as a standard to perform the Asset Management responsibilities and tasks of their electricity and gas networks. Equipment life cycle and technical performance activities form an integral part of the implementation of an Asset Management system. In this context, Stedin felt the strong need to have access to systematic techniques and guidelines on how to deal with information of equipment lifetimes. In this paper a systematic method, based on Statistical Life Data Analysis, which deals with limited or incomplete life time data of large populations of assets with the aim of obtaining an indicator of the future failure expectancy is discussed. The methods and analytical tools developed in this contribution share a basic framework for decision-making and specify the evolution of the failures of asset population over time.",

The controller is proven to achieve the desired voltage regulation independently from the PV source voltage, the converter parameters and the kind of the load. Extended mathematical analysis shows that the proposed control scheme guarantees damping characteristics (passivity) of the closed-loop system, which represents a fundamental property for achieving stability at the desired equilibrium. Simulation and experimental results verify the controller efficiency for a single resistance-inductance load case and for a nonlinear load consisted of a three-phase voltage source inverter and a three-phase resistance-inductance.",

Based on the two level inverter, the paper further deals with space vector PWM technique for a three level inverter. A new algorithm is adopted which ensures reduced computational complexity and the same methodology can be used with higher levels as well. Further a performance comparison of both two and three level inverter is done and this proves superiority of multilevel inverters over an ordinary inverter.A new multilevel space vector modulation (SVM) technique, termed mapped hybrid SVM, is presented. The SVM technique enables the use of three level SVM with multilevel inverters without introducing any carrier level modulation or phase shifts. The proposed technique is theoretically analyzed for five-, seven- and nine-level inverters and then generalized for the m-level inverter, validated by simulation using Matlab/Simulink and confirmed practically for a five-level, shunt, active power filter.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new space-division multiple-access (SDMA) approach for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink systems using statistical precoding. The proposed scheme makes use of rotated discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices to realize spatial divisions, each of which defines a cluster within which users have their transmit-side eigenmodes aligning closely with a common rotated DFT matrix. Users inside a cluster are divided into groups, and users exhibiting orthogonal eigen-directions are put in the same group realizing SDMA. It is shown that the proposed scheme can greatly enhance the average system throughput if compared with time-division multiple-access, especially when transmit-side correlation is high. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme outperformances traditional linear precoding schemes such as zero forcing when the feedback bits for the channel state information are limited.",

It has found its paramount importance in various signal processing applications. Amongst them, design of Finite duration Impulse Response (FIR) filter using DE algorithm has drawn special interest in recent times. In this paper, we have analyzed the impact of various mutation strategies of DE algorithm for the design of linear-phase low pass FIR filter. The performance of this evolutionary optimization technique has been evaluated in terms of its convergence behaviour for different mutation schemes. Additionally, the behaviour of the designed filter under different mutation strategies has been analyzed by studying its magnitude and impulse response. Finally, the most suitable mutation scheme has been suggested for this specific design problem.",

By this, the need for high-precision ADCs is eliminated, which become especially problematic for data rates exceeding several Gbit/s. Within the work, synchronous demodulation of up to 5 Gbit/s data rate is demonstrated. Moreover, it is experimentally validated that through the presented receiver concept a substantial amount of phase noise suppression can be achieved.",

In this special situation, the characteristics of high-frequency and over-voltage of the isolated hydropower group have great influence on the self-excitation boundary conditions and transient control of the hydropower generators. This paper studies the self-excitation characteristics of generators in isolated hydropower group. The emphasis is placed on the great influence on self-excitation boundary conditions and transient process by the characteristics of high-frequency and over-voltage of the isolated hydropower group. To avoid self-excitation, two practical criterions are derived respectively in the form of impedance and capacity. Furthermore, simulation of the self-excitation transient process is carried out in an isolated hydropower group in Sichuan Power Grid. The results validate the conclusions of the research.",

        "abstract": "A control scheme for a variable speed tidal stream turbine is proposed. The system consists of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) with the stator windings connected to the grid through a frequency converter. This frequency converter consists of two pulse width modulated (PWM) converters connected in a back-to-back configuration with an intermediate DC bus. A field oriented control scheme for this system is presented and simulated in Simulink using the SimPowerSystems Library. It allows the generator side converter to control the speed of the generator in order to maximise the extracted power while the grid side converter can be used to keep the DC link voltage constant and control the active and reactive power delivered to the grid.",

The electrostrictive property of BST is exploited to turn the resonator on and off by applying a DC voltage. The device exhibits a quality factor of 157 and 301 at its series and parallel resonance frequencies, respectively.",

But in some areas of Far East (Japan, Taiwan) power companies use other criterion for the assessment of voltage fluctuation - the voltage flicker index Delta V10 which characterizes the actual flicker with respect to an equivalent value of the voltage modulation component with the frequency of 10 Hz. There are a lot of attempts to find a simple and reliable approach for the converting from one index to other by multiplying the index with a factor, but no universal method was developed. In the paper is shown that the ratio between both flicker assessment criteria is dependent on signal parameters.",

        "abstract": "Determining the location of individuals within indoor locations can be useful in various scenarios including security, gaming and ambient assisted living for the elderly. Healthcare services globally are seeking to allow people to stay in their familiar home environments longer due to the multitude of benefits associated with living in non-clinical environments. Technology to determine an individual's movements or lack of movement is key to ensuring that home emergencies are detected and responded to promptly. This paper proposes a device-free wireless-based localisation (DFL) system which would enable the individual to proceed with normal daily activities without the constraint of having to wear a traceable device. The principal behind this is that the human body absorbs/reflects the radio signal being transmitted from a transmitter to one or more receiving stations. The system design procedure facilitates the use of a minimum number of wireless nodes with the aid of a principle component analysis (PCA) based intelligent signal processing technique. Results demonstrate that human detection and tracking are possible to within 1m resolutions with a minimal wireless hardware infrastructure.",

The present technologies are discussed and areas where improvements should be made for application to offshore wind farms are identified. Alternative options based around interconnected clusters of turbines controlled by a single power converter using both AC and DC technologies are discussed. A control strategy based on power flow regulation for an AC based cluster is also outlined, and the impact of collectively varying the rotational speed of a cluster of wind turbines on predictions of annual energy production for a cluster is investigated.",

        "abstract": "In order to maximize the power spectrum utilization (PSU) while satisfying the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) emission mask, an improved two-stage ultra-wideband (UWB) pulse shaping method based on Gaussian derivatives is presented. Firstly, sub-pulses are designed by optimal combination of Gaussian derivatives over specific sub bands with the condition of maximizing the PSU allowed by emission mask. Secondly, the full band UWB pulse is shaped by the combination of the outputs of parallel band-pass filters (BPFs) bank with the sub pulses as inputs to these BPFs. Simulation results show that the UWB pulse shaped not only meets the FCC emission mask in full band, but also uses the limited power capacity more effectively, improving the PSU rate to enhance the performance of received UWB signal processing possibly. The proposed idea of sub band pulse design may be useful in narrow band interference mitigation as well in application of UWB technology.",

        "abstract": "The accurate modeling of transients in underground cables requires the use of proper time domain models, as no reliable and efficient frequency dependent model exists. Proper frequency selection is crucial for the calculation of underground parameters in time domain modeling, especially when studying transient phenomena. In this paper, the spectrum context of various transient responses in underground cables is analyzed in order to calculate the dominant frequency. A thorough investigation on the source type, cable length, cable terminations and representation of the imperfect earth is implemented so as to determine their influence on the dominant frequency. The validity of empirical rules for the determination of the dominant frequency is also investigated. Results obtained in the time domain, using the proposed frequency, are compared with those obtained from a recently developed frequency domain model, leading to significant remarks.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an improved current controller to achieve a high current performance in grid connected converter under distorted grid voltage condition. The proposed control scheme is employed in synchronously rotating reference frame that consists of a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller plus a resonant (R) controller tuned at six times of grid frequency. The complexity of the proposed control algorithm is greatly reduced because a single resonant controller is enough to eliminate effectively both negative fifth and positive seventh harmonic components in current, which are caused by distorted grid voltage. The control strategy is analyzed and design of resonant controller in discrete form will also be presented. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed control algorithm.",
