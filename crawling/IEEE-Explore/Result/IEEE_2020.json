The proposed technique comprises a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the range-Doppler ambiguity function serving as its input. A radar simulator is developed to generate range-Doppler data for a single target with an isotropic antenna. The method is compared with the classical Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) detector, and it is demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms CFAR approximately by a factor of 2 terms of probability of detection (Pd) and by a factor of 100 in terms of probability of false alarm (PFA), at a minor cost of computational complexity."

Valasek[1] which can be used in non-volatile memory applications based on two energetically stable distinct electric polarization states. The conventional perovskite based ferroelectric materials suffer from CMOS incompatibility and scalability issues, hence cannot be used in state of the art scaled CMOS technologies. In 2011, ferroelectricity was reported in CMOS compatible scaled doped HfO2 films [2-3], which can solve the integration issues of perovskites based ferroelectrics. Among the HfO2 based ferroelectric materials, the mixed oxide of HfO2 and ZrO2 (Hf0.5Zr0.5O2) exhibits good ferroelectric properties with a wide process window and CMOS back-end compatible thermal budget."

An analytical expression is derived by using Chernoff approximation for the error probability of the considered system. Then, an asymptotic error expression is also proposed for the considered system. The results obtained from the derived expression are presented in comparison with exact results. Numerical results are shown for different configurations in order to analyze the effects of different values of fading parameter, antenna number and modulation type. In conclusion, it is observed that the approximate results are close to the exact results."

In this context, Ankara University Turkish Sign Language dataset is used to synthesize new sign videos using a given signer frame as a reference and a skeleton stream. To solve this challenging problem, a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed, where skeletal data is used as a condition. Using the trained model, we are able to generate sign video streams with the given signer, where the motion dynamics are successfully and fluently encoded in the video. Moreover, we evaluated the quality of the generated images using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric; the FID score is 26."

In our method, the two-dimensional histogram of Weber’s features and LBP for camera identification are investigated. For this purpose, experiments were conducted on Dresden database. The proposed method has reached the accuracy of 99.52% on nine digital cameras of different models. In compressed JPEG images with the compression quality factor of 70% the method reached the accuracy of 89.04%. The results indicate that the proposed method has a high degree of accuracy in comparison to other proposed method and exhibits relatively good robustness to compression."

        "abstract": "For businesses, retaining a customer's interest is more advantageous when compared to winning over a new customer. Identifying churned and churn-risk customers allow businesses to change strategies beforehand fort the best possible outcome. In this study, a new method is suggested to be used in non-contractual businesses. One of the widely used methods for these types of businesses in the literature is modeling customer behavior using Beta-geometric Negative Binomial Distribution (BG/NBD). While this method performs favorably on predicting the total churn rate in a population, it is also known to perform poorly on labeling individual customers. This study aims to improve BG/NBD model by incorporating machine learning into its decision process. In the suggested method, the mathematical definition of BG/NBD model is used for feature extraction and utilized using decision trees. When tested on two data sets with different characteristics, it is observed that the suggested method improves performance by a significant amount."

Then, since such a method is very sensitive to the state space dimension, I will give some insights on how to lighten the computational burden of the hierarchy while maintaining numerically certified approximations."

Novel 3D heterogeneous integration technologies using self-assembly have been developed to achieve high-throughput and high-precision multichip-to-wafer stacking. Many known good dies (KGDs) are simultaneously self-assembled on a carrier wafer with a high alignment accuracy making use of liquid surface tension. The self-assembled dies on the carrier are simultaneously transferred to another wafer or interposer wafer by electrostatically de-bonding the carrier wafer after Cu nano-pillar hybrid bonding of self-assembled dies. These liquid surface tension technologies have been also applied for massively parallel self-assembling of known good dies (KGDs) on large-area substrates such as glass panels and rigid/flexible organic substrates. Three kinds of 3D heterogeneous integration technologies with large-area substrates, face-down self-assembly/direct stacking with via-middle TSVs, face-down self-assembly/direct stacking with via-last TSVs, and face-up self-assembly/transfer stacking with via-last TSVs, are demonstrated. In addition, a new TSV formation methodology based on advanced Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) with nanocomposites consisting of nano metal particles and block-co-polymers is proposed. Cylindrical nano-ordered structures with metal which act as nano-TSV are formed in Si deep holes through phase separation of polystyrene-block-poly methyl methacrylate polymers (PS-b-PMMA). These new self-assembly technologies have been applied to develop new heterogeneous 3D LSIs for AI including neuro LSIs. New cyclic neuro LSI will be presented."

Record high remnant polarization (Pr) on FE HZO and record high saturation polarization (PS) on AFE HZO are achieved with WN electrodes, especially in ultrathin sub-10 nm regime. [1, 2] A high dielectric constant of 30.4 is achieved on AFE HZO. The polarization switching speeds of FE and AFE HZO are also systematically studied. For the first time, it is found polarization switching speed is faster in AFE HZO than FE HZO.

        "abstract": "In recent years, demand for energy and Distributed Generation (DG) resources has been increasing due to developing technology, increasing population density and environmental factors. Energy management, which is becoming more complex especially during the transformation process that renewable energy based DG units play an active role in, has revealed the smart grid concept. Thanks to this concept, consumers can both realize their consumption optimally with the smart home structure and actively participate in energy production with their own DG investments. In the last few years, one of the advantages offered by smart grid and smart home energy management to end consumers is the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading market, which means interpersonal. With this new energy market that has emerged, the participants who can make their own generation can sell their excess energy to other participants or to the power grid. In this paper, it is aimed to minimize the electricity bills of the end consumers by modeling the P2P energy trading structure in which the demand-side management is also taken into account. The proposed model was carried out in GAMS environment with CPLEX solver."

        "abstract": "To deploy the AI to the edge, compute-in-memory (CIM) with emerging non-volatile memory technologies is a promising solution with improved throughput and energy efficiency. First, DNN+NeuroSim benchmark framework is presented to assess the pros and cons of various device technologies for implementing C1M. Second, the grand challenges associated with inference engine design are discussed with the lessons learned from the XNOR-RRAM prototype chip. Third, the grand challenges associated with on-chip training are introduced and algorithm-level mitigation techniques are developed. To enable the on-chip training and subsequent inference in an integrated platform, a hybrid precision synapse combined with non-volatile memory and volatile memory (e.g. capacitor) is proposed. A 2-transistor-1-FeFET design is presented as a compact solution of the hybrid precision synapse."

However, at the sensor there are often stringent constraints on energy consumption and cost in addition to the throughput and accuracy requirements of the application. In this talk, we will describe how joint algorithm and hardware design can be used to reduce energy consumption while delivering real-time and robust performance for applications including deep learning, computer vision, autonomous navigation/exploration and video/image processing. We will show how energy-efficient techniques that exploit correlation and sparsity to reduce compute, data movement and storage costs can be applied to various tasks including image classification, depth estimation, super-resolution, localization and mapping."

Therefore, the algorithm used for the hardware to be designed and the number format in which this algorithm operates are quite important. In this study the hardware that calculates the cosine and sinus trigonometric functions commonly used in digital applications is designed in FPGA with Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm which combines the three feature mentioned. The designed hardware operates in a two-complement signed integer format and the bit length is adjustable by the user. Thus, a design with the advantages of high speed and usage area efficiency as well as flexibility has been created. Simulation and implementation of the design is done for the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA model in Vivado software."

Activity learning success was tested using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, SVM, Linear SVM, KNN and MLP machine learning methods. The methods were applied to different types of activities consisting of the BEHAVE dataset commonly used in surveillance video event recognition literature. The study shows the comparative performance of the machine learning methods used. Experimental results show that classification procedures have been achieved successfully. Although the percentages of performance obtained by the methods are approximately close to each other, SVM method yields the best activity recognition result."

In this talk I will discuss recent research on the fast and accurate analytical models that can replace slow cycle-accurate models of the NoCs in system-level models.

In this way, engine efficiency was improved by reducing engine losses. While designing, Ld / Lq ratio, which has an effect on engine performance, was taken into consideration. As a result of the parametric analysis made on the rotor lamination, it was decided to use the structure with 4 barriers. With the newly designed SynRM, it has been observed that the efficiency class of the asynchronous motor with IE1 efficiency class according to IEC standards has increased to IE4."

The number of renewables is increasing with the help of various support policies. Wind energy constitute a significant part of this increase. Besides, in many countries, it mandatories for these sources to participate in electricity markets. These stochastic sources may experience imbalances in real-time power delivery. In this respect, it seems reasonable that wind energy sources should be gathered under portfolio manager so that eliminate imbalances. In this study, a structure is proposed that the wind energy portfolio manager aims to maximize total profit by participating in the day-ahead and balancing market, considering the risk. To prove effectiviness of the proposed structure, several case studies were carried out with Turkey and Sweden electricity market prices."

        "abstract": "Cu is used as the interconnect material in IC chips because of its superior conductivity. However, the diffusion of Cu into the dielectric between two interconnects can cause shorting and create chip failures, while the diffusion to transistors can introduce deep-level traps to Si and affect the transistor performance. Ta/TaN bilayer stacks have been used as diffusion barrier/liner materials to isolate Cu from surrounding intra/inter-layer dielectrics. Along with the scaling of VLSI, the dimensions of interconnects and vias need to be scaled as well. To maximize Cu volume for lower line resistance and reduce the via resistance, the thickness of the barrier/liner bilayer should be scaled accordingly. However, these materials lose their capability of blocking Cu diffusion as their thickness is extremely reduced. In this talk, I will give an overview of diffusion barrier and liner properties of several 2D materials for comparison, then focus on 2D layered tantalum sulfide (TaSx) with $\\sim$1.5 nm thickness that we believe has the potential to replace the conventional TaN/Ta bilayer. The TaSx ultra-thin film is industry-friendly, BEOL-compatible, and can be directly prepared on dielectrics. Our results show superior barrier/liner properties of TaSx compared to the TaN/Ta bilayer. This single-stack material, serving as both a liner and a barrier, will enable continued scaling of interconnects beyond 5 nm node."

        "abstract": "In the recent years, with the development of neural network based models, ASR systems have achieved a tremendous performance increase. However, this performance increase mostly depends on the amount of training data and the computational power. In a low-resource data scenario, publicly available datasets can be utilized to overcome data scarcity. Furthermore, using a pre-trained model and adapting it to the in-domain data can help with computational constraint. In this paper we have leveraged two different publicly available datasets and investigate various acoustic model adaptation approaches. We show that 4% word error rate can be achieved using a very limited in-domain data."

In the past decade Hadoop Distributed FileSystem (HDFS) has become the de facto storage choice for large scale analytics. Growing data storage needs at Twitter has forced us to solve multiple scalability, reliability, hardware layout and performance problems in HDFS. At Twitter we have scaled HDFS storage across multiple clusters by incrementally consuming new features and contributing scalability fixes to open source community. In this presentation we lay out our architecture for scaling HDFS for Exabyte storage, share our learnings managing such large scale distributed system and note few changes for future."

The cascaded Rayleigh fading channels are considered since investigations have shown that cascaded channel structure agree better with mobile network models such as inter-vehicular communication systems. A cooperative network where a source terminal communicates with a destination directly and through a selected relay among K relays is considered and the achievable average rate of this system using NOMA is found by computer simulations. The obtained results for cascaded Rayleigh fading channels in case of decode and forward protocol have shown that the average rate is decreased as the cascading degree increases. It has been also seen that for a given cascading degree the average rate performance of the system is increased when the number of total relays is increased."

In this study, a new approximated DCT architecture is proposed to reduce the complexity and energy consumption of DCT hardware used in image compression by high efficiency video coding (HEVC) intra prediction method. This architecture is based on the use of shift and add operation instead of multiplication, and the use of approximate 5:3 compressor chains for addition operations. ."

Also details of the proposed method are explained. Although there are various direction finding methods in the literatüre, no mature studies performing sirection finding using an autoencoder have been found. an encoder have been found. In the study shown in [1], the autoencoders designed for different spatial regions were used to filter the received signal into spatial subregions before the deep neural network making direction prediction. In the proposed study, direction estimation is made only by using deep ecoder networks over the reconstruction errors that result from encoding and recoding of signals reaching multiple antenna arrays. For every azimuth direction in the region of interest, there exists a unique otuencoder which has been trained by signals with constant SNR. Proposed direction finding method that looks at the reconstruction errors produced by these autoencoders for the impinging signal has been compared with the currently known and widely used MUSIC algorithm and the performances of both algorithms have been examined in detail."

Given that cars today have over 100 ECUs (ECU - control unit), communication and management of all these ECUs become a challenging task. This paper focuses on the control units used to display the content and process the data of each screen in the car. The number of control units for data processing and display of content can be reduced by using SoC (SoC - System on a chip) with a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a concept that allows us to run two operating systems on one SoC in real-time. The proposed system consists of one SoC with two operating systems running on a hypervisor and having the ability to display content on three different screens. The proposed solution covers the simultaneous display of content from both operating systems on one screen as well as the display of visual warnings on all screens in the digital cockpit, regardless of the operating system that hosts that screen. Alerts are displayed from a higher security operating system regardless of the content currently displayed from a lower security operating system. This approach has led to the certification of operating systems in terms of security."

The classifier/model designed in this way, with possible small changes, can be applied in practice, that is, realized and installed in the stoves of future generations. In addition to practical applications, the paper indicates the fusion potential of the areas mentioned here as well as a wider range of applications of mel coefficients than the standard one."

        "abstract": "There has been a growing trend in recent years to outsource various aspects of the semiconductor design and manufacturing flow to different parties spread across the globe. Such outsourcing increases the risk of adversaries adding malicious logic, referred to as hardware Trojans, to the original design. The increased complexity of modern microprocessors increases the difficulty in detecting hardware Trojans at early stages of design and manufacturing. Therefore, there is a need for run-time detection techniques to capture Trojans that escape detection at these stages. This talk will introduce a machine learning-based run-time hardware Trojan detection method for microprocessor cores. This approach uses Half-Space trees and changepoint-based anomaly detection algorithm to detect the activation of Trojans that introduce abnormal patterns in the data streams obtained from performance counters. It does not modify the original microprocessor design to integrate on-chip monitoring sensors. We evaluate our method by detecting the activation of Trojans that cause denial-of-service, the degradation of system performance, and change in functionality of a microprocessor core. Results obtained using the OpenSPARC T1 core and an field-programmable gate array (FPGA) prototyping framework show that the Trojan activation is detected with a true positive rate of above 99% and a false positive rate of 0% for most of the implemented Trojans."

Developing high-performance parallel CAD software is extremely challenging, as CAD algorithms consist of a broad mix of domain knowledge and computing components that are not part of regular software development. This talk addresses a long-standing question: How can we make it easier for CAD software developers and researchers to rearchitect existing software to parallel targets with high performance scalability and simultaneous high productivity? We will cover both algorithm and system aspects that can help streamline the creation of large parallel CAD tools scalable to manycore CPUs and GPUs."

The magnets in the investigated brake topology are placed into slot openings of the structure so as to increase the braking torque. This differs the design from conventional magnet-free brake structures. The proposed brake is modeled by a reluctance based network and Newton-Raphson approach is used as nonlinear solver. A multiobjective particle swarm optimization is created and used in the design case, which aims to have 28 Nm of braking torque. The optimized model is obtained by nondominating results in three-dimensional Pareto surfaces and analytical results are compared with finite element analyses. The results obtained from the analytical approach and the FEA agree well and it is shown that the investigated design methodology is an effective and fast approach so as to obtain the optimized design parameters in such eddy current brake structures."

Many of the problems in our daily life, such as weather forecasting, medical diagnostics, speech recognition, and etc. are the classification problems. That's why, these problems have often been addressed with classification algorithms in the literature. In this study, the use of electric fish optimization algorithm together with artificial neural networks is explored for solving classification problems, and the performance of the algorithm has been investigated by comparing it with popular heuristic algorithms in the literature. The findings show that electric fish optimization algorithm performs classification with less error on average than its competitors."

        "abstract": "Human society is witnessing a wave of machine learning(ML) driven by dep learning techniques, bringing a technological revolution for human production and life. In some specific fields, ML achieved or even surpassed human-level performance. However, most previous machine learning theories have not considered the open and even adversarial environments, and the security and privacy issues are gradually rising. Besides of insecure code implementations, blased models, adversarial examples, sensor spoofing can also lead to security risks, which are hard to be discovered by traditional security analysis tools. This talk reviews previous works on ML system security and privacy, revealing potential security and privacy risks. Firstly, we introduce a threat model of ML systems, including attack surfaces, attach capabilitiesand attack goals. Second, we analyze security risks and countermeasures in terms of four critical components in ML systems: data input (sensor), data preprocessing, machine learning model and output. Finally, we discuss future research trends on the security of ML systems. The aim si to arise the attention of the computer security society and the ML society on security and privacy of ML systems, and so that they can work together to unlock ML's potential to build a bright future."

Si doping in HfO2 to form a ferroelectric material was discovered by Qimonda AG in 2010; recently, ferroelectric Hf-based oxide materials have been used in many applications, such as memory, negative capacitance, passive component, and solar cells. For the Al (Artificial lntelligence) and loT (lnternet of Things) era, the requirement of scaling down supply voltage VDD and power consumption for low power devices is the pursued goals for CMOS and memory applications. The ferroelectric gate stack is integrated into FETs with NC effect for subthreshold swing (SS) improvement. The feasible concept of coupling the polarization Hf-based oxide is practicable to following current CMOS architectures."

        "abstract": "The main problem of radiation-based flame detection systems is false alarms. The common reasons for false alarms of these systems are noise as interference on channel and environment, and other non-flame source's radiation that comes to the system. The aim of that study is to design a software-based filter that detects “fire” for incoming signal in the range of 5 Hz - 10 Hz and lasts at least 0.5 seconds. For processing the signal and decision-maker, Wavelet Analysis and Fuzzy Logic Algorithm has been used. The test was completed by using flame data on Simulink and applying the filter on Matlab & Simulink. The experiment results show that by using Wavelet Analysis, it is possible to extract signals within the specific frequency range from the original signal by decomposing it and after processing part, classifying the inputs for flame detection purposes."

Rogers RT5870 was chosen as the dielectric substrate which has 2.33 dielectric constant, 0.787 mm dielectric thickness, 35..m copper thickness and 0.0005 loss tangent. According to the simulation results, Gysel power combiner has a maximum power loss of 0.1 dB, maximum 0.1 dB amplitude unbalance, maximum 1 degree phase imbalance across the 2.3-2.6 GHz band. Since the layouts of microstrip lines were created by paying attention to high frequency design principles, no significant difference was observed in the circuit and electromagnetic simulation results. When the actual circuit was measured, the results of maximum 0.2 dB power loss across the 2.3-2.6 GHz band, maximum 0.1 dB amplitude imbalance between the inputs, maximum 1 degree phase imbalance results were obtained."

A total of two cable groups was used, and each group consists of five different cables with five defects. Each cable has one defect. 120 partial discharge patterns were acquired for each defect (1200 patterns in total). One group of cables was used in the training phase and the other in the testing phase. Residual neural networks, one of the deep learning algorithms, were used in the analysis and classification of the data. The results show that the residual neural network algorithm can be used as an efficient diagnostic tool for classifying poor workmanship defects in cable termination, and partial discharge measurements provide valuable information in classifying defects."

Respiratory signals, such as airflow, mouth pressure, lung volume comprise the complex relationship which has not been inspected and how it is linked to the fractal structure of the lung has not been scrutinized. Thus the aim of this study is to determine the mono or multifractal property of the respiratory signals by using well known method, Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA). Real signals were analyzed by utilizing already proposed MF-DFA algorithm and generalized Hurst exponent values were shown for different scales. In the results, it was shown that respiratory signals are fractional Brown motion type signals and fractal properties exhibit less inter- subject change. Finally, it was proved that apart from the airflow and lung volume, respiratory sounds and signals are multifractal signals. It appears that the presence of long-memory property of the lung is the primary reason of the multifractality."

        "abstract": "To protect the SoC supply chain from such vulnerabilities, academic and industry researchers have proposed many design for security and hardware Trojan detection techniques. However, these techniques either rely on RTL verification methods which may not be applicable to netlist/layout level designs or leverage testing/measurement results to indirectly identify possible hardware vulnerabilities. There lacks a CAD tool based deterministic process which can convert layouts/netlists into RTL code for design verifications. In this talk, I will introduce our recent effort in building such a CAD toolchain through which a layout in GDS-II format can be de-syntheiszed and converted to the high level description, e.g., RTL code, for security analysis. The CAD toolchain includes a series of circuit reverse engineering tools which can also be applied individually for specific tasks such as design deobfuscation, hardware Trojan detection, etc. This toolchain fits in an even larger concept of CAD for Security, a recent trend for SoC/IC protection and trust verification."

        "abstract": "DSAs for machine learning (ML) such as Google TPU, Microsoft Brainwave, Xilinx xDNN are becoming prominent because of high energy-efficiency and performance. These DSAs perform dense linear algebra efficiently by minimizing data movement, exploiting high data reuse, regular memory access pattern and data locality (temporal and spatial). DSAs for domains like graph analytics and HPC are emerging at at rapid pace as well where most of the computations revolve around sparse linear algebra, specifically Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV). SpMV refers to the multiplication of a sparse matrix A by a dense vector x to produce a result vector y. Designing high performance and energy efficient DSs for SpMV is challenging due to highly irregular and random memory access patterns, prro temporal and spatial locality and very low data reuse opportunites. SpMV DSs explorit distributed onchip memory blocks to store vector entries for avoiding off-chip random memory access. However, a switching network architecture or a crossbar is usually required as a building block for routing matrix no-zero elements to on-chip memory blockjs. In thus presentation, we will discuss about the network architectures and switches employed in most of the SpMV DSAs, our SpMV DSA based on 2D-mech network, design choices for the FPGA implementation of the DSA, and scalability aspects. In more detail for our use-case, we will highlight the importance and challenges of achieving energy efficient data movement using scalable on-chip network architectures."

        "abstract": "Optimization problems are ubiquitous in scientific research, engineering as well as daily lives. However, solving a complex optimization problem often requires excessive computing resource and time, and faces challenges in easily getting trapped into local optima. Here, we propose a memristive optimizer hardware based on Hopfield network, which introduces transient chaos to simulated annealing in aid of jumping out of the local optima while ensuring convergence. A single memristor crossbar is used to store the weight parameters of fully-connected Hopfield network and adjust the network dynamics in situ. Furthermore, we harness the intrinsic nonlinearity of memristors within the crossbar to implement an efficient and simplified annealing process for the optimization. Solutions of continuous function optimizations on sphere function and Matyas function as well as combinatorial optimization on Max-cut problem are experimentally demonstrated, indicating great potential of the transiently chaotic memristive network in solving optimization problems in general."

The availability of relatively low cost, reliable, long-endurance underwater acoustic recorders has meant that an increasing amount of acoustic data is being collected. One of the key motivators for this technology is to study marine mammals, be that to: monitor for them to activities (e.g. sonar transmissions) to mitigate impacts, explore animal distributions or to estimate species abundance. Having collected the large datasets there is a need to develop tools to assist with the analysis - traditional analysis methods rely upon manual inspection of data in near-real time, which becomes unfeasibly demanding when deployments can last months."

High precision sensors have been designed over the last decade using photonic crystals. These sensors are mainly based on physical parameters such as refractive index, temperature, and pressure variation. In this study, a sensor is designed using a two-dimensional photonic crystal with a triangular lattice structure. This sensor consists of holes placed periodically on a silicon wafer and deliberate defects formed on the photonic crystal. The defect modes obtained with this sensor design enabled the targeted samples to be detected."

With the wide/rapid spread of distributed systems for information processing, such as cloud computing and social networking, not only transmission but also processing is done on the intemet. However, cloud environments have some serious issues for end users, such as unauthorized access, data leaks, and privacy compromise, due to unreliability of providers and some accidents. Accordingly, we first focus on compressible image encry ption schemes, which have been proposed for encryption-then-compression (EtC) systems, although the traditional way for secure image transmission is to use a compression-then encry ption (CtE) system. EtC systems allow us to close unencrypted images to network providers, because encrypted images can be directly compressed even when the images are multiply recompressed by providers. Next, we address the issue of leamable encryption. Huge training data sets are required for machine leaming and deep leaming algorithms to obtain high performance. However, it requires large cost to collect enough training data while maintaining people's privacy."

We have utilized the analog and non-volatile nature of memristors to build a Classical Annealer for solving optimization problems more rapidly and at lower energy than current digital systems or Quantum Annealers under development. The presence of intrinsic analog noise in the circuits can be effectively harnessed and dampened as needed in the computing. In another work, we have developed new circuits and assembled architectures that accelerate Finite Automata, enabling rapid pattern matching used in applications from network security to genomics.

One way is to make electronics to be wearable, but it would not be pervasive enough; on the other hand, ifwe make the wearables (such as textile, hydrocolloid patches) to be integrated with electronics, then the pervasive healthcare becomes a reality. However, such a wearable environment is challenging for circuit designers due to unstable skin-electrode interface, huge mismatch, and static/dynamic offset. Wet and dry electrodes have very different electrical characteristic that needs to be addressed. Also, in wearable environment, trade-off between available resource and performance among the components (analog front-end and digital back-end) is of crucial. This talk will cover the design strategies of wearable healthcare sensor SoC. We will cover various circuit topologies and their key metrics to deal with such non-ideal wearable environments. Finally, an on-chip patient-specific epilepsy detection System-on-Chip (SoC) for wearables will be presented, which integrates all the components covered during the talk. The talk will conclude with interesting aspects and opportunities that lie ahead."

Novel 3D heterogeneous integration technologies using self-assembly have been developed to achieve high-throughput and high-precision multichip-to-wafer stacking. Many known good dies (KGDs) are simultaneously self-assembled on a carrier wafer with a high alignment accuracy making use of liquid surface tension. The self-assembled dies on the carrier are simultaneously transferred to another wafer or interposer wafer by electrostatically de-bonding the carrier wafer after Cu nano-pillar hybrid bonding of self-assembled dies. These liquid surface tension technologies have been also applied for massively parallel self-assembling of known good dies (KGDs) on large-area substrates such as glass panels and rigid/flexible organic substrates. Three kinds of 3D heterogeneous integration technologies with large-area substrates, face-down self-assembly/direct stacking with via-middle TSVs, face-down self-assembly/direct stacking with via-last TSVs, and face-up self-assembly/transfer stacking with via-last TSVs, are demonstrated. In addition, a new TSV formation methodology based on advanced Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) with nanocomposites consisting of nano metal particles and block-co-polymers is proposed. Cylindrical nano-ordered structures with metal which act as nano-TSV are formed in Si deep holes through phase separation of polystyrene-block-poly methyl methacrylate polymers (PS-b-PMMA). These new self-assembly technologies have been applied to develop new heterogeneous 3D LSIs for Al including neuro LSIs. New cyclic neuro LSI will be presented."

        "abstract": "Future nano-electronics circuits will critically require the ability to fabricate materials with precise, atomic-level control over structure and properties. Traditionally, fabrication of atomic-scale materials has been achieved through vapor-phase atomic layer deposition (ALD); however, this process has several drawbacks such as the use of unstable gas-phase precursors which may decompose yielding contaminated deposits. An alternative electrochemical approach, using liquid-phase precursors, called electrochemical atomic layer deposition (e-ALD) will be outlined in this talk. Through self-limiting surface electrochemistry coupled with electrode potential manipulation, electrochemical growth of metals (such as Cu and Co) one atomic layer at a time can be achieved. Attractive features of our electrochemical ALD approach include the use of benign, stable and low-cost precursors, high-purity deposits, versatility in terms of deposited materials and operating conditions, and scalability to large-area wafers. Extensions of the e-ALD process chemistry to achieve atomic layer etching (e-ALE) will also be demonstrated."
