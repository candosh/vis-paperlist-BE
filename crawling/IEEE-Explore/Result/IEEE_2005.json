The approach has been applied to rural and urban distribution systems. In particular, a functional relationship between failure rate and maintenance measures has been developed for a cable component. The results show the value of using a systematic quantitative approach for investigating the effect of different maintenance strategies."

Users look through a head mounted display (HMD) and the object being modeled appears as a 3D augmentation in the real world. This object can be manipulated using a tangible interface of marker panels that correspond to the modeling tools in 3D Studio Max, and a wireless pointer device. Unlike virtual reality which brings the user into the virtual world, this system places the 3D model in the user's world while allowing the use of a large range of complex 3D polygonal modeling tools provided by 3D Studio Max."

To harness these capabilities, we need to move to peer-to-peer networks of smart cameras. Such systems perform distributed video analysis without a central server. Peer-to-peer systems save bandwidth and energy, are cheaper to install, and are more fault-tolerant. The Embedded Systems Group at Princeton University is developing smart cameras and peer-to-peer networks. After describing the application demands, we briefly describe architectures for embedded real-time video processing in smart cameras. We then describe video algorithms and network architectures for peer-to-peer gesture recognition and tracking."

With regard to the existence of bounded and expectedly repetitive initial condition, the convergence and robustness of the learning algorithm are discussed. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to show the algorithm's efficiency."

Refactoring is usually described as a way to keep software as simple as possible, or as a way to reuse parts of a software system that were not designed to be reusable. But it has other uses. One of the problems with using software components is that new versions of the components require changes in the systems that use them. If the change from one version of a component to another is described as a set of re factorings then the parts of the system that use them can be automatically changed to use the new versions of the component. This makes it much easier for developers to use the latest versions of components."

This paper covers the graphics capabilities of modern mobile devices, their limitations, and graphics APIs designed for these devices. We will also discuss what is unique with mobile graphics compared to desktop graphics."

There has been several decades of work in AI in defining conversational agents that based on agency, that model dialog in terms of reasoning about goals, plans, and intentions. While theoretically powerful, these projects have not resulted in dialogue systems with the level of robustness attained using statistical information extraction approaches. Because it uses deeper understanding of language and can involve reasoning processes, however, the agent-based approach has the potential for handling much richer applications than the statistical approaches. For the past decade we have been working to develop models that find a good balance between generality and robustness. I would describe these efforts and propose some ideas on further bridging the gap between the two technologies"

A method is proposed for estimating the measurements that becomes unavailable due to metering problems. To address the low redundancy associated with the load monitoring scheme, the method uses a regression-based model and makes use of the strong correlation between the loads that are geographically close to each other. The method was tested with actual field data. The results indicate that the method has the acceptable performance for measurement loss of up to a week. The average estimation error varies 2-7.5%, depending on which measurement is lost and how up-to-date the historical data is."

It is known that an untransposed open-ended line causes a negative sequence component in the current and the generator reacts through third and higher harmonic voltages. The currents and voltages can be greatly amplified by resonance to any of these harmonics. The phenomenon of machine-line interaction has traditionally been explained as a sequence of interactive events between the line and the machine. This paper presents a unified non-iterative mathematical representation of this interaction. The analysis is formulated in the harmonic domain abc-frame to detect resonance conditions and for the assessment of their stability."

The PHDE method utilizes pixel histograms of the halftone rather than the block histograms used by the previous full-dot pattern (FDP) approach. It is then less affected by the growing of the dither size than the FDP approach. The PHDE approach also explores the component structure of clustered-dot dither to suggest an averaging operation over the neighboring histograms, which can reduce considerably the number of missing dither components. The experimental results show our PHDE method was very effective and much better than the FDP approach."

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. In addition to single event upsets during read and write operations, like many other digital devices with internal state machines and operating modes, NAND flash devices are also susceptible to single event functional interrupts (SEFI). Due to the increasing complexity of device architectures, the ability detect and characterize the SEFI events is emerging as the primary challenge in SEE testing. At JPL we have developed testing algorithms and hardware which specifically addresses this issue. We have taken SEFI and read/write upset data on devices which is presented here"

The great logician Alfred Tarski played one of the leading roles in the development of mathematical logic in the twentieth century, as much for the programs he promoted and the conceptual organization of the subject as for his many important results. Except for his fixed-point theorem, Tarski's influence on computer science has been largely indirect but nevertheless substantial. The author surveys this influence through his work in the areas of decision procedures, semantics of formal languages, model theory, and algebraic logic."

This paper deals with the process of achieving zero mitigated magnetic field at any point of consideration from center of right-of-way by implementing an auxiliary loop beneath the outer phases of an existing active conductors. For numerical demonstration, a flat configuration of 750 KV transmission line is utilized. Flux induced by the active conductors in the loop is calculated and henceforth the obtained current flowing along the auxiliary loop causes magnetic field, which fully opposes the one originated by the conductors. At the same time, interaction of magnetic field originated by the transmission line at other points with that of the loop also results in noticeable mitigation at the points."

I also review some results in human abilities to understand sound mixtures, and what these may be able to tell us about promising automatic approaches"

For any given filter, averaging a large amount of SCs defined by replacement of an observation, yields the ODIF for the expectation."

This search for organization can focus on the data itself, on the source of the information, or on the sink, or user of the information. Analogous approaches can be used to identify how information is organized in the DNA sequence. In this talk we describe how techniques which have proven useful in developing compression algorithms are also capable of helping uncover organizational structures in DNA sequences. We also show how this process of discovery can lead to the development of tools which are useful in investigating and perha ps understanding genomic sequences."

This paper presents two methods to estimate the mean life and its standard deviation of a power system equipment group with limited end-of-life or aging failure data. One is for the normal distribution model and another for the Weibull distribution model. Unlike the conventional sample mean technique which only uses ages of died components, the presented methods are based on all the information in an equipment group including both died and surviving components and provide a more accurate estimation. In the method for the normal distribution, the estimate is obtained from a set of simple calculation formulas while for the Weibull distribution, an optimization technique is used to obtain the estimates of the mean and its standard deviation as well as the shape and scale parameters. An equipment group containing 100 reactors with only four retired units was used as an application example to illustrate the procedure."

The different nature of such I/Os from the lower-speed parallel ones, high volumes, and deployment of hundreds of these I/Os on a single chip pose new test and yield challenges for cost-effective production of many today’s and future ICs. Such challenges include testing signal integrity parameters, i.e., jitter, voltage, and impedance, especially in the presence of pre- or de-emphasis and receiver equalization. The \"high-speed I/O test\" innovative practices track includes three presentations to discuss such challenges and provide solutions. First presenter will discuss SUN Microsystems approach for yield enhancement and test of devices with tens and hundreds of high-speed I/Os. The second speaker will address signal integrity test issues, and the third contributor will provide an ATE perspective of test challenges and possible solutions."

In this study, we develop a low-complexity, generalized low-rank LMMSE channel estimator for MIMO-OFDM systems using comb-type pilots. The estimator utilizes the relationship between the sub-spaces of the frequency domain channels at the pilots and non-pilots subcarriers. By then using subspace tracking, if is observed that practical LMMSE channel estimation of MIMO-OFDM systems can be feasible."

The tracking trajectory is composed of a set of sequentially-operated piecewise continuous sliding surfaces which the system's state can follow to the equilibrium in phase plane. The algorithm using the boundary layer technique is capable of handling the reaching phase (RP) of the trajectory and chattering effects inherent to the VSC easily and effectively. By using distance-based two-layer fuzzy sliding mode controller, the state would follow the sliding surfaces in turn, and the parametric uncertainties or disturbances can be reduced effectively and the response of the tracking error will be small than that of the distance-based single-layer fuzzy sliding mode control. It is shown that the stability of the control system is guaranteed in the Lyapunov sense. Finally, an inverted pendulum control problem subject to external disturbance is simulated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm"
