        "abstract": "Urban traffic congestion is a major nuisance for residents' daily commute, but few studies have focused on the effective combination between urban traffic condition visualization and hybrid traffic travel route recommendation. In this paper, the visualization exploration of urban transportation patterns is realized by multilayer complex transportation networks, which are constructed by taxi transportation network, bike-sharing transportation network, and urban transportation community network. Based on multilayer complex traffic networks, a genetic algorithm modified by A * search algorithm is used to generate multi-modal travel routes. The case studies prove that this method can effectively reduce the time cost of commuting between congested areas by generating hybrid traffic routes."

We extend a recent incident report summarization method by training a Bayesian hierarchical model to optimize the summarization algorithm's weights. We also train a flat model and a neural network as alternative models to compare against our hierarchical model. Summaries generated by our hierarchical model achieve higher accuracy than the other methods, with an AUC 0.2 higher than the unweighted method while achieving comparable summarization size. We further demonstrate that visualizations of the hierarchical model's summaries are at least as useful the unweighted method's summaries, and possibly more useful."

Given multivariate or ensemble scalar field volumes and their velocity vector field counterparts, Scalar2Vec first identifies suitable variables for scalar-to-vector translation. It then leverages a k-complete bipartite translation network (kCBT-Net) to complete the translation task. kCBT-Net takes a set of sampled scalar volumes of the same variable as input, extracts their multi -scale information, and learns to synthesize the corresponding vector volumes. Ground-truth vector fields and their derived quantities are utilized for loss computation and network training. After training, Scalar2Vec can infer unseen velocity vector fields of the same data set directly from their scalar field counterparts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Scalar2Vec with quantitative and qualitative results on multiple data sets and compare it with three other state-of-the-art deep learning methods."

Unfortunately, the black box nature of RL agents, combined with legal and ethical considerations, makes it increasingly important that humans (including those are who not experts in RL) understand the reasoning behind the actions taken by an RL agent, particularly in safety-critical domains. To help address this challenge, we introduce PolicyExplainer, a visual analytics interface which lets the user directly query an autonomous agent. PolicyExplainer visualizes the states, policy, and expected future rewards for an agent, and supports asking and answering questions such as: “Why take this action? Why not take this other action? When is this action taken?” PolicyExplainer is designed based upon a domain analysis with RL researchers, and is evaluated via qualitative and quantitative assessments on a trio of domains: taxi navigation, a stack bot domain, and drug recommendation for HIV patients. We find that PolicyExplainer's visual approach promotes trust and understanding of agent decisions better than a state-of-the-art text-based explanation approach. Interviews with domain practitioners provide further validation for PolicyExplainer as applied to safety-critical domains. Our results help demonstrate how visualization-based approaches can be leveraged to decode the behavior of autonomous RL agents, particularly for RL non-experts."

However, there is still a lack of under-standing of how misinformation can be introduced when text and visualization are combined to tell data stories, not to mention how to improve the lay public's awareness of possible misperceptions about facts in narrative visualization. In this paper, we first analyze where misinformation could possibly be injected into the production-consumption process of data stories through a literature survey. Then, as a first step towards combating misinformation in data stories, we explore possible defensive design methods to enhance the reader's awareness of information misalignment when data facts are scripted and visualized. More specifically, we conduct a between-subjects crowdsourcing study to investigate the impact of two design methods enhancing text-visualization integration, i.e., explanatory annotation and interactive linking, on users' awareness of misinformation in data stories. The study results show that although most participants still can not find misinformation, the two design methods can significantly lower the perceived credibility of the text or visualizations. Our work informs the possibility of fighting an infodemic through defensive design methods."

However, this complexity makes qualification of the parts, determining whether a part is within some margin of error from the initial design, difficult. To inspect and qualify complex internal geometries that are not accessible with an external probe, parts are typically scanned with computed tomography (CT), and manually compared to the computer-aided design (CAD) model using visual inspections. Matching the CAD model to the 3D reconstructed object is challenging in a traditional desktop environment due to the lack of depth perception and 3D interaction. An additional challenge comes from the geometric complexity of CAD meshes and large-scale CT scans. We present a virtual reality (VR) system for manual qualification, providing a novel defect visualization method. First, we describe a semiautomatic CAD-to-Scan Registration approach in VR using a finite element mesh. Second, we introduce the Defect Box, which enables full-resolution inspection for massive scans and CAD-CT comparison of local defect regions. Finally, our system includes intuitive 3D Metrology methods that enable natural interactions for the measurement of features and defects in VR. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data and discuss feedback from four expert users in nondestructive qualification."

        "abstract": "High-dimensional imaging is becoming increasingly relevant in many fields from astronomy and cultural heritage to systems biology. Visual exploration of such high-dimensional data is commonly facilitated by dimensionality reduction. However, common dimensionality reduction methods do not include spatial information present in images, such as local texture features, into the construction of low-dimensional embeddings. Consequently, exploration of such data is typically split into a step focusing on the attribute space followed by a step focusing on spatial information, or vice versa. In this paper, we present a method for incorporating spatial neighborhood information into distance-based dimensionality reduction methods, such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We achieve this by modifying the distance measure between high-dimensional attribute vectors associated with each pixel such that it takes the pixel's spatial neighborhood into account. Based on a classification of different methods for comparing image patches, we explore a number of different approaches. We compare these approaches from a theoretical and experimental point of view. Finally, we illustrate the value of the proposed methods by qualitative and quantitative evaluation on synthetic data and two real-world use cases."

        "abstract": "In an era of quickly growing data set sizes, information reduction methods such as extracting or highlighting characteristic features become more and more important for data analysis. For single scalar fields, topological methods can fill this role by extracting and relating critical points. While such methods are regularly employed to study single scalar fields, it is less well studied how they can be extended to uncertain data, as produced, e.g., by ensemble simulations. Motivated by our previous work on visualization in climate research, we study new methods to characterize critical points in ensembles of 2D scalar fields. Previous work on this topic either assumed or required specific distributions, did not account for uncertainty introduced by approximating the underlying latent distributions by a finite number of fields, or did not allow to answer all our domain experts' questions. In this work, we use Bayesian inference to estimate the probability of critical points, either of the original ensemble or its bootstrapped mean. This does not make any assumptions on the underlying distribution and allows to estimate the sensitivity of the results to finite-sample approximations of the underlying distribution. We use color mapping to depict these probabilities and the stability of their estimation. The resulting images can, e.g., be used to estimate how precise the critical points of the mean-field are. We apply our method to synthetic data to validate its theoretical properties and compare it with other methods in this regard. We also apply our method to the data from our previous work, where it provides a more accurate answer to the domain experts' research questions."

This study explores an affect-centered narrative to convey data-driven messages regarding contact tracing apps (CTAs) using video as a medium (i.e., data video). A between-subjects online study compared the effect of three storytelling approaches on viewers' perception. A video developed by Google was selected as the baseline video (Control Condition; 2min 23s) due to its high quality and relevance to CTAs. The central messages of this baseline video were; a) how CTAs work, and b) how safe and effective CTAs are. Infographics supporting these messages were then added to the baseline video (the second condition; 3min 19s); this was a simple data video (DV), and it did not intend to induce specific emotional experiences in participants (i.e., cognition-centered video). Finally, an affect-focused DV (AFDV) was also created by emphasizing the emotion-based narrative aspect of the message (the third condition; 4min 6s). In this video, three cute human-like cartoon characters were introduced. Viewers in this condition needed to process both cognitive and affective information. Note all three videos (i.e., control video, DV, and AFDV) conveyed identical messages. Participants watched one of these three videos only once, and we explored the video effect on their perception. Our results repeatedly indicated the potential benefits of including affect in data storytelling."

Thus, our previously developed visual analytics system, entitled StackGen Vis, was designed to monitor and control the entire stacking process visually.

Notably, News Kaleidoscope is tailored for visualization non-experts, and adopts an analytic workflow based around subselection analysis, whereby second-level features of articles are extracted to provide a more detailed and nuanced analysis of coverage diversity. To robustly evaluate News Kaleidoscope, we conduct a trio of user studies. (1) A study with news experts assesses the insights promoted for our targeted journalism-savvy users. (2) A follow-up study with news novices assesses the overall system and the specific insights pro-moted for journalism-agnostic users.

Our solution suggests to delegate the detailed data representation to other views and to concentrate in the presented overview on the organization of the focus regions. The approach consists of three parts: a collection of strips where the annotations are represented in a condensed form and where sibling- and child-foci are manipulated, a map of the resulting tree of foci for direct access, and a work bench that allows to compare deliberate nodes of the tree on a flat layer. We discuss our approach by comparing it with other state-of-the-art multifocus techniques and describe two use cases that deal with relational annotation and with the analysis of annotations on hierarchical text structures respectively."

Though unstructured grids allow for the flexible representation of this geometry and the refinement of the grid resolution, they suffer from high storage cost, non-trivial spatial queries, and low reconstruction smoothness. On the other hand, rectilinear grids do not have these drawbacks, but they cannot represent complex boundaries. We present in this paper a technique for the high-quality approximation of large unstructured datasets with solid boundaries onto modified rectilinear grids that we endow with boundary handling capabilities. The resulting data representation can accommodate challenging boundaries while supporting high-order reconstruction kernels with a much-reduced memory footprint. As such, our data representation enjoys all the benefits of conventional rectilinear grids while addressing their fundamental geometric limitations. We demonstrate the proposed approach on several CFD datasets and show that our method achieves an accurate and high-quality approximation of simulation datasets."

Parallel Sets and Parallel Coordinates are two well-known techniques to visualize categorical and numerical data, respectively. A common strategy to visualize mixed data is to use multiple information linked view, e.g., Parallel Coordinates are often augmented with maps to explore spatial data with numeric attributes. In this paper, we design visualizations for mixed data, where the dataset may include numerical, categorical, and spatial attributes. The proposed solution SET-STAT-MAP is a harmonious combination of three interactive components: Parallel Sets (visualizes sets determined by the combination of categories or numeric ranges), statistics columns (visualizes numerical summaries of the sets), and a geospatial map view (visualizes the spatial information). We augment these components with colors and textures to enhance users' capability of analyzing distributions of pairs of attribute combinations. To improve scalability, we merge the sets to limit the number of possible combinations to be rendered on the display. We demonstrate the use of Set-stat-map using two different types of datasets: a meteorological dataset and an online vacation rental dataset (Airbnb). To examine the potential of the system, we collaborated with the meteorologists, which revealed both challenges and opportunities for Set-stat-map to be used for real-life visual analytics."

        "abstract": "The annual incidence of head and neck cancers (HNC) worldwide is more than 550,000 cases, with around 300,000 deaths each year. However, the incidence rates and disease-characteristics of HNC differ between treatment centers and different populations, due to undetermined reasons, which may or not include socioeconomic factors. The multi-faceted and multi-variate nature of the data in the context of the emerging field of health disparities research makes automated analysis impractical. Hence, we present a visual analysis approach to explore the health disparities in the data of HNC patients from two different cohorts at two cancer care centers. Our approach integrates data from multiple sources, including census data and city data, with custom visual encodings and with a nearest neighbor approach. Our design, created in collaboration with oncology experts, makes it possible to analyze the patients' demographic, disease characteristics, treatments and outcomes, and to make significant comparisons of these two cohorts and of individual patients. We evaluate this approach through two case studies performed with domain experts. The results demonstrate that this visual analysis approach successfully accomplishes the goal of comparing two cohorts in terms of different significant factors, and can provide insights into the main source of health disparities between the two centers."

        "abstract": "Scientific datasets are often analyzed and visualized using isosurfaces. The connected components at or above the isovalue defining these isosurfaces are called superlevel-set components. The vertex set of these superlevel-set components can be used to compute local statistics, such as mean temperature or histogram per component, or to segment the data. However, in datasets produced by acquisition devices or simulations, noise induces many spurious components that clutter the visualization and analysis results. Many of these spurious components would disappear if the data values were slightly adjusted. The notion of persistence captures the stability of a component with respect to function value changes, and so we are interested in computing persistence quickly. Locality of computation is critical for parallel scalability, minimization of communication in a distributed environment, or an out-of-core processing. The recently introduced merge forest attained high performance by exploiting locality, thereby avoiding communication until needed to resolve a feature query. We extend the merge forest to support persistence-based queries and study the locality of these queries by evaluating the traversals of regions of data during a query. We confirm that the majority of evaluated datasets have the property that the noise is mostly local, and thus can be efficiently eliminated without performing a global analysis. Finally, we compare the query running times with those of a triplet merge tree because a triplet merge tree answers all proposed queries in constant time and can be constructed from a merge tree in linear time."

        "abstract": "Ranking the node importance in complex networks has been widely applied for different purposes, such as web search, resource allocation, and network security. However, existing node ranking methods are almost single network ranking using only one relationship, or aggregate the node ranking scores on multiple networks with equal weight, which are insufficient to construct reasonable multiple network rankings, since the association information among multiple networks is largely ignored. Thus, we propose a multiple network visualization framework by fusing multiple networks to obtain credible node ranking scores. After measuring the scores of nodes in each single network by the classic PageRank, a network weight self-adjustment model based on structural similarities between pair-wise networks is designed to strengthen the common features of multiple networks or their distinct characteristics. Then, a combined score for each node is computed by a weighted sum of its individual ranking scores on multiple networks. Besides, we provide a set of visualization and interaction interfaces, enabling users to intuitively explore, optimize and compare the multiple network rankings. Case studies on real datasets show that our system is flexible to adapt to different application scenarios, and users can successfully solve multiple network ranking tasks efficiently."

        "abstract": "Given images of a person, person re- identification (Person ReID) techniques aim to find images of the same person from previously collected images. Because of large data sets of person images and the advance of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) successfully boost the accuracy of Person ReID algorithms, but it can be difficult to explain and to troubleshoot issues due to the complexity of CNNs. In this paper, we present a visualization-based approach to understand a CNN-based Person ReID algorithm. As Person ReID algorithms are often designed to map images of the same person into similar feature vectors, given two images, we design an algorithm to estimate how much each element in a CNN layer contributes to the similarity between their feature vectors. Based on the estimation, we build a visualization tool to interactively locate and visualize the activation of highly-contributing elements, other than manually examining all. Our visualization tool also supports various user interaction widgets to explore a Person ReID data set, locate difficult cases, and analyze the reason behind their similarities. We show a use case with our tool to understand and troubleshoot issues in a CNN-based Person ReID algorithm."

Various approaches for refining parallel corpora have been introduced, but there is still much room for improvements, such as enhancing the efficiency and the quality of refinement. We introduce VANT, a novel visual analytics system for refining parallel corpora used in training an NMT model. Our system helps users to readily detect and filter noisy parallel corpora by (1) aiding the quality estimation of individual sentence pairs within the corpora by providing diverse quality metrics (e.g., cosine similarity, BLEU, length ratio) and (2) allowing users to visually examine and manage the corpora based on the pre-computed metrics scores. Our system's effectiveness and usefulness are demonstrated through a qualitative user study with eight participants, including four domain experts with real-world datasets."

        "abstract": "Shape-based metrics measure how faithfully a drawing D of a large graph G shows the structure of graph, by comparing the similarity between G and a proximity graph S computed from D. Although these metrics can successfully evaluate drawings of large graphs, they are limited to relatively sparse graphs, since existing metrics use planar proximity graphs GG (Gabriel Graph) and RNG (Relative Neighbourhood Graph). This paper presents new shape-based faithfulness metrics for evaluating drawings of large and complex graphs, using high-order prox-imity graphs k-GG and k-RNG. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our new shape-based metrics using degree-based proximity graphs dGG and dRNG can more accurately measure the faithful-ness of drawings of large and complex graphs, with a significant improvement of over 100% better, on average, than the existing shape-based metrics using GG and RNG. Moreover, we present a new shape change faithfulness metric DSC for evaluating drawings of dynamic graphs, by measuring how proportional the geometric shape change in the drawings of dynamic graphs is to the ground truth change in dynamic graphs. Validation using deformation experiments support that DSC can accurately measure shape change faithfulness in dynamic graph drawing. Furthermore, we present extensive comparison experiments of ten popular graph layouts using our new shape-based metrics dGG, dRNG and DSC, to recommend which layouts can give a better shape-faithful graph drawing for large and complex graphs."

        "abstract": "Multi-agent systems require coordination among the agents to solve a given task. For movement on fixed-track networks, traditional scheduling algorithms have dominated so far, but the interest in autonomous and intelligent agents is growing as they promise to react to unexpected and exceptional situations more robustly. In this paper, we study data from the Flatland 2020 NeurIPS Competition, where trains move through a virtual rail network. We developed a timeline-based visualization that provides an overview of all train movements in a simulated episode, clearly hinting at different phases, non-optimal routes, and issues such as deadlocks. This view is complemented with a map view and a graph view, interactively linked through highlighting and synchronous animation. Defining regions of interest in the map builds an analysis graph for detailed inspection. A comparison mode allows contrasting two different episodes regarding the same rail network across all views. We have conducted this application study in close collaboration with the Flatland community. Identified analysis goals stem from interviews with key persons of the community, while the approach itself was developed in two iterations based on feedback from experts with diverse backgrounds. This feedback, together with an analysis of the winning submissions from the competition, confirms that the initial analysis goals can be answered."
