The system dependency is illustrated in a parameter study."

In other words, a BCI allows users to act on their environment by using only brain activity, without using peripheral nerves and muscles. The major goal of BCI research is to develop systems that allow disabled users to communicate with other persons, to control artificial limbs, or to control their environment. To achieve this goal, many aspects of BCI systems are currently being investigated. Research areas include evaluation of invasive and noninvasive technologies to measure brain activity, evaluation of control signals (i.e. patterns of brain activity that can be used for communication), development of algorithms for translation of brain signals into computer commands, and the development of new BCI applications. In this paper we give an overview of the aspects of BCI research mentioned above and highlight recent developments and open problems."

This paper analyzes in detail analysis the unambiguous spectrum reconstruction of the nonuniform sampling SAR signals and multi-channel SAR imaging; Based on the difference and correlation between the multi-channels signals and single channel signal, we resolve the multi-channels SAR imaging, the simulate results prove that the theoretic analysis is correct."

Compared to Si devices, the mobility limited by NA is enhanced in strained Si whereas the mobility limited by Nit is degraded. These new findings are explained through valleys population and scattering rate considerations. It is also found that the interface state generation in strained Si is smaller than in Si. This fact is beneficial to the device performance as well as the MOS device reliability."

Two examples of spatio- temporal results representative of the street guided propagation and diffraction over rooftop mechanisms, are analysed. Thereafter, the study focuses on the polarization analysis. The average polarization matrix is computed and compared with previously published results. The polarization dependency with the physical propagation parameters is also investigated."

Ontogenesis is the process that allows living beings to develop by means of mechanisms as growing, selfüreplication, and selfürepair. During the last few years, such ontogenetic mechanisms have been presented as a solution for the design of complex electronic circuits, with the goal of coping with the increasing complexity envisioned for future nanoütechnology devices. This paper presents an ontogenetic mechanism that allows a system, implemented in a reconfigurable device, to selfüreplicate, generating an identical copy of itself, by partially selfüreconfiguring the device containing it in a dynamic way."

First, the advancing front mesh technique is used to cover the hole with newly created triangles. Next, the desirable normals of the new triangles are approximated using our desirable normal computing schemes. Finally, the three coordinates of every new vertex are re-positioned by solving the Poisson equation based on the desirable normals and the boundary vertices of the hole. Many experimental results and error evaluations are given to show the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm."

To enable software developers to work more effectively, software engineering researchers often deliver tools, which produce even more information. The effect of more and more tools producing more and more information is placing developers into overload. It would be reasonable to here a software developer utter, \"Houston: We are in overload\"! In this talk, I will discuss the quagmire in which software developers are finding themselves, discuss how they are coping based on data collected from the activity of developers, and suggest ways of helping developers regain control."

Three machine types are tested under various load conditions using the proposed technique. The first machine type are a three-phase 2.24 kW and a 3.73 kW induction motors. The second is a 4.5 kW synchronous generator. The last is a 5 kW dc machine which is operated as both motor and generator. The results show that the machine power losses calculated from the proposed technique has an error less than 4 % comparing with power losses from the experiment. Therefore, the technique can be acceptable for the estimation of power losses in electrical machine. The main advantage of this method is that the machines need not to stop or to be removed from their operation process in order to measure their losses."

The method is simple and can be easily applied to complex surface modeling. With the method, spline surfaces can be constructed efficiently and adoptively to fit genus-zero meshes after their spherical parameterization is obtained, where only small sized linear systems of equations are involved."

This paper proposed a new research approach, which was to use information fusion technology to process the detected information of tunnel equipments, take the tunnel's characteristics into consideration, and then apply intelligent control technology to the formation of whole control plan."
