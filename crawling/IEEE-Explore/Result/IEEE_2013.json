        "abstract": "The research presented in this paper is aimed at the higher frequency (HF) voltage distortion in public low voltage (LV) grids in the range between 2 kHz and 40 kHz. The particular focus lies on the emission caused by modern photovoltaic (PV) inverters. Based on laboratory measurements, the general characteristics of the emission spectrum of these inverters are discussed and a suitable evaluation method is proposed. The next part presents the results of a long term measurement campaign recording voltage distortion levels at 25 sites up to 40 kHz. Grids without PV installations show very low distortion levels. In grids with PV the level is closely linked to the location of the inverter in relation to the measurement site. In general, the lowest distortion levels were recorded at the transformer LV bus bar. The highest levels were reached at the point of connection (POC) of an inverter. At all sites no customer complaints are known due to HF voltage distortion. The last part of the paper presents a case study, where the connection of a machine with inverter technology caused HF distortion levels, which led to multiple device malfunction and noise in household appliances and subsequently to customer complaints.",

        "abstract": "Resource Allocation (RA) in cellular networks is a challenging problem due to the demanding user requirements and limited network resources. Moreover, mobility results in channel gains that vary significantly with time. However, since location and received signal strength are correlated, user mobility patterns can be exploited to predict the data rates they will experience in the future. In this paper, we show that with such predictions, long-term RA plans that span multiple cells can be made. We formulate an optimal Predictive Resource Allocation (PRA) framework for a network of cells as a linear programming problem for three different objectives. Presented numerical results provide a benchmark of the PRA performance in realistic and random user mobility scenarios. Significant network and user satisfaction gains are observed compared to RA schemes that do not utilize any predictions.",

By applying controlled torques to the reaction wheels the Cubli is able to balance on its corner or edge. This paper presents the development of the Cubli. First, the mechatronic design of the Cubli is presented. Then the multi-body system dynamics are derived. The parameters of the nonlinear system are identified using a frequency domain based approach while the Cubli is balancing on its edge with a nominal controller. Finally, the corner balancing using a linear feedback controller is presented along with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Synchrophasor systems will play a significant role in next generation Smart Grid monitoring, protection and control. However, these systems also introduce a multitude of potential vulnerabilities and cyber threats from malicious attackers or disgruntled employees, which may cause erroneous situational awareness or severe damage. This paper proposes a Synchrophasor Specific Intrusion Detection System (SSIDS) for malicious cyber attacks and unintended misuse. The SSIDS involves a heterogeneous whitelist and behaviour-based approach to detect known and unknown attacks. The paper investigates and simulates reconnaissance, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks against a practical synchrophasor system that is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SSIDS detection tool. In contrast to previous research in this area that generally has investigated known attacks, this research actively considers the operational features of the IEEE C37.118 protocol and presents a more comprehensive and general solution to deal with not only known attacks but also unknown attacks.",

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the propose method, it is applied to IEEE 14-bus test system using a binary artificial bee colony algorithm (BABC) and compared with genetic algorithm (GA).",

        "abstract": "The face expression recognition problem is challenging because different individuals display the same expression differently [1].Here PCA algorithm is used for the feature extraction. Distance metric or matching criteria is the main tool for retrieving similar images from large image databases for the above category of search. Two distance metrics, such as the L1 metric (Manhattan Distance), the L2 metric (Euclidean Distance) have been proposed in the literature for measuring similarity between feature vectors. In content-based image retrieval systems, Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance are typically used to determine similarities between a pair of image [2]. Here facial images of three subjects with different expression and angles are used for classification. Experimental results are compared and the results show that the Manhattan distance performs better than the Euclidean Distance.",

However, the existing LTE uplink scheduling algorithms can't be applied to M2M services. It is necessary and urgent to optimize the LTE uplink scheduling algorithms. In this paper, we propose a LTE uplink scheduling algorithm named M2MA-SA under massive M2M and H2H arrivals. M2MA-SA differentiates between M2M and H2H services. For massive M2M services, a compound 2-phase scheduling mechanism is presented, which combines maximum-utility scheduling with round robin scheduling. For H2H services, an algorithm named Iternative Maximum Expansion (IME) is used which satisfied the contiguity constraint of LTE uplink resource allocation. The simulation results show that M2MA-SA not only guarantees the QoS of H2H communication, but also improves the system throughput and the capacity of H2H users.",

Electric vehicles (EVs) are thought to be a good solution to these problems. With EV adoption, energy flow is two way: from grid to vehicle and from vehicle to grid, which is known as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) today. This paper considers electric power systems and provides a review of the impact of V2G on power system stability. The concept and basics of V2G technology are introduced at first, followed by a description of EV application in the world. Several technical issues are detailed in V2G modeling and capacity forecasting, steady-state analysis and stability analysis. Research trends of such topics are declared at last.",

Models for the energy consumption of the RF and decoding stages are discussed and included in the design of the proposed resource allocation policies. The allocation is performed discretely over subcarrier, bit loading, and power by means of practical greedy-like algorithms and considering energy-related constraints in order to increase the duration of the batteries and, thus, the network lifetime. Simulation results show that not only the usage of battery is improved when compared with other traditional allocation policies, but also the average bit-rate is enhanced.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic exploration techniques play a significant role in automated web application testing and analysis. However, a general web application crawler that exhaustively explores the states can become mired in limited specific regions of the web application, yielding poor functionality coverage. In this paper, we propose a feedback-directed web application exploration technique to derive test models. While exploring, our approach dynamically measures and applies a combination of code coverage impact, navigational diversity, and structural diversity, to decide a-priori (1) which state should be expanded, and (2) which event should be exercised next to maximize the overall coverage, while minimizing the size of the test model. Our approach is implemented in a tool called FEEDEx. We have empirically evaluated the efficacy of FEEDEx using six web applications. The results show that our technique is successful in yielding higher coverage while reducing the size of the test model, compared to classical exhaustive techniques such as depth-first, breadth-first, and random exploration.",

The trial involves three stages, each of which are described in this paper. The first stage investigated the potential impact from electric vehicle charging on the operating conditions of existing residential network. During the trial, electric vehicles were driven and charged by typical residential electricity customers. The data recorded during the trial details the charging patterns of the vehicles and the associated effects on the network. Stages 2 and 3 of the trial, which are currently ongoing, will involve examining basic control charging techniques and the effects of network reconfiguration respectively.",

This paper introduces a three phase load flow method that can handle both passive and active unbalanced radial distribution networks. The proposed method combines the direct-ZBR method (Forward-Backward based method) and Modified Lambda iteration. The direct ZBR load flow [1]is known as a fast and accurate method for solving passive radial three phase distribution systems. The Modified Lambda approach is chosen because of its simple algorithm that can be easily combined with direct ZBR method in handling DG'swhich are operated as voltage controlled(PV) buses.",

With the number of EVs gradually rising, problems may occur in technical characteristics of the network, like bus voltages and line congestion [1]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop EV management systems so as to prevent such phenomena. The effectiveness of such systems is heavily depended on the early knowledge of future demand. This knowledge can be provided by accurate EV load forecasting techniques. In this paper, the use of various data mining methods is examined and their performance in EV load forecasting is evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Due to the increasing use of modern technologies (e.g. PWM inverters in PV installations, equipment with active power factor correction circuits, PLC, ...) the emission levels in the frequency range between 2 kHz and 150 kHz are rising continuously. In the recent time the number of reported disturbances (e.g. malfunctions of coffee machines, audible noise of electronic ballasts) caused by this emission is growing. Beside these obvious interferences the question arises, if electronic mass-market equipment is affected by this higher frequency (HF) emission as well. Especially in shunt elements with low impedance at higher frequencies, like DC-link capacitors in rectifier circuits, larger high frequency currents can occur, which may result in additional thermal stress and lifetime reduction. Based on a laboratory setup the paper analyses the impact of HF components in the supply voltage on the operating temperature within different lamps with electronic ballast. Using a laboratory setup the frequency-dependent input behaviour of different electronic equipment was measured up to 50 kHz. For selected lamps detailed temperature studies were carried out.",

The algorithm employs three models a physical model, energy model and State of Charge (SoC) model. The outputs of the models are averaged using a weighted average. This approach provides redundancy and more importantly availability of the function. Methods are employed to provide the driver with an accurate initialisation range value when the ignition is switched on. This utilises past driving history data and determines an output value based on the previous drive cycle. The work describes the flow sequence of the EV range function. Results for several drive cycles are analysed and show that accurate EV range prediction is achieved using the algorithm.",

The impacts of the measurement device placement on the state estimation accuracy and on the bad data detection capabilities are illustrated. To ease the comparison of different measurement sets, a visualization method of the expected performances of the state estimator is presented. The paper finally gives measurement placement recommendations based from a literature review and our experience gained from simulations.",

The concern related to global energy crisis and climate change threats from conventional sources of energy leads to look for alternate sources of energy. Solar energy is seen as a potential alternate source of energy as it is available globally in abundant. To develop an efficient and stable solar PV energy conversion various analysis are done by the researchers. It is analyzed at various facets like PV module characteristic and its arrangement, Power Electronics converters topologies, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm, stability of the system etc. This paper present an overview of the research going on in this area, focused on aspects mentioned above. This overview may be useful for further investigation to improve the system.",

        "abstract": "Powertrain size optimisation based on vehicle class and usage profile is advantageous for reducing emissions. Backward-facing powertrain models, which incorporate scalable powertrain components, have often been used for this purpose. However, due to their quasi-static nature, backward-facing models give very limited information about the limits of the system and drivability of the vehicle. This makes it difficult for control system development and implementation in hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test systems. This paper investigates the viability of using forward-facing models in the context of powertrain component sizing optimisation. The vehicle model used in this investigation features a conventional powertrain with an internal combustion engine, clutch, manual transmission, and final drive. Simulations that were carried out have indicated that there is minimal effect on the optimal cost with regards to variations in the driver model sensitivity. This opens up the possibility of using forward-facing models for the purpose of powertrain component sizing.",

Modelling efforts were focused on diffusion as the predominant dynamic process relevant to battery management systems. An equivalent circuit model approach was adopted with parameters dependant on temperature and state of charge (SOC). The model was parameterised at 50°C, 20°C, 0°C and -30°C and between 10% and 100% SOC. Initial parameter estimations for the model identification procedure were informed by EIS. The model was validated (at constant SOC), for the entire temperature range and at C-rates between C/2 and 9C, by voltage simulation based on a dynamic drive cycle profile. Maximal residuals did not exceed 68 mV or 2% of the nominal cell voltage (Vnom) and root-mean-squared deviations remained within 28 mV or 0.8% of Vnom at all temperatures and C-rates.",

The relative effectiveness of these different codes is then measured with specific factors of merit, designed for radar performances evaluation. These factors of merit, easily extracted from the ambiguity functions, are shown to allow operational consequences to be drawn from space-time codes characteristics.",

SCADA systems have inherent cyber vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with limited consideration of cyber attacks or threats. There is little published literature which rigorously considers SCADA-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the IEC 608705-104 protocol. This paper presents a rule-based IDS for IEC 60870-5-104 driven SCADA networks using an in-depth protocol analysis and a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method. The proposed SCADA-IDS involving signature-based and model-based detection is exemplified using a protocol traffic case-study.",

        "abstract": "In the high-resolution, wide-swath imaging application of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Digital Beam-Forming (DBF) technique can be employed to receive and handle echo data with multiple channels in elevation, for the purpose of increasing the receive gain and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). According to the geometric relationship among these channels, this paper analyzes the impulse response function of arbitrary elevation channel, and derives its explicit expression. Based upon this, an improved DBF processing scheme, which combines the time-variant weighting and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering, is presented. Additionally, the block diagram of this DBF configuration is given. Compared with other echo-receiving methods, this approach can maximize the receive gain and optimize the system performance for the case of long pulse, without much increase of the system complexity. Simulation results indicate that it enables the system to achieve its theoretically optimal receiving performance.",

The behaviour of the HVDC system during a permanent line-to-line fault is analyzed in details at each stage of the fault timeline. Operation of the proposed system under a specific earthing configuration i.e. converter unearthed /AC transformer secondary side and DC cable solidly earthed, is also analyzed. Simulation studies are provided to assist the analytical analysis. It is observed that both faults leads to substantial AC and DC over-current and result in DC side oscillations.",

The impacts of PV location are analysed through two scenarios based on location: closer to and further from the distribution transformer. Voltage impacts are measured using EN50160 and the thermal capabilities are examined through a utilisation factor. Additionally, the effects of higher LV busbar voltages are also investigated. Results indicate that voltage issues are more constraining than asset utilisation, particularly with clusters closer to the transformer.",

        "abstract": "In a smart grid environment, economic operation means not only to economic scheduling of generation, but also to scheduling the load. In a Microgrid (MG), which comprises of intermittent Distributed Generators (DGs) (eg. solar and wind energy sources), the need of Demand Side Management (DSM)/ Demand Response (DR) becomes significant. The key point in DSM is to shift the load to some other point in time, this causes inconvenience to the customer and therefore it should be minimized. Minimizing the cost of generation and also minimizing the inconvenience caused due to shifting of loads is a multiobjective optimization problem. In this work the authors consider an industrial/ commercial MG with one solar source, two diesel generators and one battery, with the assumption that the utility grid uses dynamic pricing. The objective function contains discontinuous functions which will be difficult to solve using conventional optimization techniques and hence a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based solution is proposed.

CGS are defined in a way that no dangerous voltages occur [2], which might be a weak or incomplete definition. In this paper results from own and published earthing measurements [4], [5], [7], [8] (especially touch voltages) in different areas (city, villages, rural areas) are analyzed and compared to simulation results [6], [9] of global earthing systems. Additionally these results are compared to values of earthing systems of large substations and power plants. Measurements of touch and step voltages inside global earthing systems show that these values are far below given limits in standards. The question arises if this is true in all cases or if there are exceptions.",

Google and other search engines deal only with the indexed surface web. The deep-dark web hosts illegal markets, such as the Silk Road, malware emporiums, illegal pornography, and covert meeting places and messaging services. The pervasiveness of the Internet provides easy access to dark-web sites from anywhere in the world. The growth of the dark web has been paralleled by an increasing number of anonymity web-overlay services, such as Tor, which allow criminals, terrorists, hackers, paedophiles and the like to shop and communicate with impunity. Law enforcement and security agencies have had only very limited success in combating and containing this dark menace. The aim of this talk is to present a systems analysis view of the dark web in order to identify possible approaches to controlling illicit activity.",

Furthermore, the integration of e-mobility will have a significant effect on distribution grids. Smart distribution systems are one way of handling these new supply scenarios. Hence, a self-sustaining monitoring and control system for LV-grids has been developed. It monitors the power flow situation and is able to control the grid if necessary.

The core idea was to build a “high versatility system” able to collect data representative of most of ongoing radar projects, but also to prepare future developments. Within this context, we have defined and built a system that can address studies such as the use of new waveforms, multi function's scheduling optimisation, the benefit of using high bandwidths for recognition, the advantage of polarimetry for target or environment identification, beam sharpening, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations, etc...The system, named HYCAM, was delivered late 2011 and this paper presents its main features and components.",

The proposed technique consists of the coordinated action of on-load tap changer (OLTC) of transformer and reactive power compensation by D-STATCOM. Managing the system voltage using the action of OLTC is one of the most common ways for voltage regulation of MV systems. However, OLTC cannot be used for voltage regulation of long radial distribution feeders as it changes the sending point voltage of the feeder. In this study, the problem of using OLTC for the voltage regulation of a radial distribution feeder will be solved by using reactive power compensation at the DG connected bus. Simulation results reveal that the proposed control method is capable of maintaining the system voltage within the permitted range in the worst scenarios of the test system.",

In the second step, a backup capacitor is connected to the fault loop and the Prony algorithm is used to extract the characteristic frequency of fault loop which is used to calculate the fault distance. A ring DC distribution system is modelled in Simulink/Matlab. The accuracy and speed of the fault location approach are verified.",

The subject addressed in this paper, is proposing a practical demand response program for industrial load management in smart power grids. The main focus of the paper is modelling industrial loads and proposing a novel load scheduling algorithm to achieve an near optimal scheduling by taking into account industrial users satisfaction, dynamic electricity pricing, and constraints regarding to electricity generation capacity. An industrial plant containing 17 devices in its production line is used for simulation studies. The high convergence speed and the appropriate results are also clarified by comparing the proposed algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.",

LVDC distribution being a novel approach to public electricity distribution, a research platform is realised to enable practical studies. The goal of the setup is to combine the requirements of the fully functional LVDC system and a flexible research platform. The scope of the paper is to discuss experiences from first six months of continuous use of the setup. The paper focuses on comparing how expected and realised results meet and how the setup has been operating in real public network. On the other hand, design flaws and challenges are covered. Finally, future research tasks and the development of the setup towards LVDC smart grid are presented.",

        "abstract": "Increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) is one of the characteristics of smart grids. The conventional distribution grid was not designed for the integration of DGs. Hence the integration of DGs into the distribution grid presents a few challenges to the operation of distribution network. This paper addresses some of these challenges and uses the concept of reconfiguration as a solution to meet these challenges. By reconfiguration, the maximum voltage at each node of the test network was kept within limits, thus mitigating the over voltage problem due to increased DG penetration. Since the reduction in number of switchings due to reconfiguration will help reduce the operation cost, this paper incorporates the objective of minimizing switching as well. The number of switchings could be reduced from six to two for the test network under consideration. Also it has been shown in this paper that reconfiguration can help in deferring the investment required in a transformer like adding on load tap changer.",

The algorithm resorts to model predictive control to smoothly bring unsatisfactory voltages inside the desired range of values. Using a sensitivity model, the controller calculates optimal power output changes of distributed generators to correct the network voltages, giving priority to reactive over active power. Simulations results are presented on a 32-bus test system and three variants of the optimization problem are compared.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the need and requirements for advanced decision support tools in future network planning from a distribution network operator perspective. The existing tools will no longer be satisfactory for future application due to present developments in the electricity sector that increase uncertainty. Advanced decision support tools can help network planners to select among the numerous alternatives for the optimal future distribution network layout and expansion schedule. This in contrast to the existing method, whereas the generation of planning alternatives is carried out heuristically by network planners based on design directives and experience. Advanced decision support tools require the most efficient optimization techniques, must be able to find the optimal investment path considering multiple scenarios, and should not only consider classic expansion strategies but also intelligent ones (e.g. energy storage and controlling active demand). Advanced decision support tools would greatly help network operators to make better decisions under uncertainty, which contributes to an affordable, sustainable, and reliable electric energy supply.",

However, it is acceptable to generate jamming signal in real-time but in low precision.

The impact of the EMC filter, either LCL or CLC configuration, has been considered from a simplified model. The high frequency current emission, produced by a large device, can potentially cause a relatively large current flowing through a nearby small device. An important conclusion from the study is that current amplification can occur due to harmonic resonances between different types of filters.",

But most of it has the problems of low recognition rate and not adapting to low SNR environment. In the paper, a novel method is proposed. The approach utilizes time-frequency analysis methods and singular value distribution(SVD) to extract the singular values of signal, making it be the feature vector., and neural network based classifiers were designed to identify radar emitter signals automatically. The experimental results show that it can achieve a satisfying accurate recognition rate when signal-to-noise rate varies in a large range. It is proved to be valid and practical approach.",

More than 900MW of photovoltaic (PV) plants were connected to this distribution grid. It was detected the problem with overvoltage in approximately 20% low voltage distribution grids with connected PV plants and this problem has to be solved. The problem with high voltage variance is caused partially due to the operation of PV plants connected into the MV distribution grid and partially due to the operation of PV plants connected into the LV distribution grid. It is supposable, that the problem with overvoltage will occur when PV plants are connected both into the MV and into the LV distribution grid in the same part of the grid. In order to cope with the increased level of distributed generation new solutions for grid operation and new technologies are needed. In the paper are described three solutions for voltage stabilization. These proposed solutions prevent nonconforming voltage quality (overvoltage) according to the EN 50160 standard and following investments.",

The aim of these advanced methods is the realisation of a cost-effective integration of high shares of distributed generation by an optimal utilisation of already available network capacities. Newly developed components (a MV/LV transformer with OLTC, adjustable PV-inverters and an intelligent control unit of the LV network) required for this active, intelligent LV network are described. The components are integrated in a rural LV network with an already high penetration of PV. Different system concepts and operating modes will be tested within this setup. First results are shown and discussed.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of wireless data demands and saturation of radio frequency (RF) capacity, visible light communication (VLC) has become a promising candidate to complement conventional RF communication, especially for indoor short range applications. However the performance of the system depends on the propagation and type of system used. We study four cells optical system where the intensity modulated beam from light sources can be concentrated in specific areas to serve multiple mobile devices with low interference and hence increase system capacity. We then compare the performance of asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM), direct current biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) and single carrier (SC) modulation schemes in single and multiuser systems.",

Since 2009, EPRI has been facilitating a collaborative initiative to develop standard functions and a standard language for grid integration of smart solar and storage inverters along with the US DOE, Sandia National Laboratories, and the Solar Electric Power Association. The initiative was designed around an open process and a large interest group became engaged, including inverter manufacturers, system integrators, research organizations and utilities. This paper illustrates three of the advanced inverter control standard functions that were identified using simulation of a distribution system containing large solar PV installations.",

In this paper, we have used video file as the cover file and embedded the information in the frames where the scene has changed in the video sequence using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) replacement technique. For additional security we have randomized the pixel positions where the information bits are embedded by generating an indexed based chaotic sequence and arranging the pixel position according to the sequence. The experimental result shows that the original cover video and stego video are visually identical i.e. there is no perceptual difference between the two videos.",

        "abstract": "This paper compares two methods that result in a more balanced operation of the electricity grid. A balanced distribution grid results in improved voltage profiles, a lower voltage unbalance and lower losses. The first method discusses the changing of the phase connection of single-phase customers. Optimization techniques with a constrained maximum number of changes show that this passive solution may be suitable for unbalanced grids. Secondly the effect of balancing three-phase PV-inverters is investigated. The proposed control consists of injecting the majority of the produced power in the phase with the highest power consumption, based only on local voltage information. Both methods are evaluated with extensive load flow simulations with real data.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and reliable state estimation is the core stone for flexible operation and control of active smart grids. Through the current expansion of integrating DG units in low voltage networks, the network operation is becoming more complex than before. However, real-time monitoring and control through state estimation is a routine task for the transmission system operators (TSO's) due to the availability of measurement data. The distribution system operators (DSO's) are trying to extend their monitoring and control for medium and low voltage network in order to enable smart grid applications. With the current rollout of smart meters, which are considered as a key component of future smart grids, there would be enough metering data in the distribution networks (voltage, current, active and reactive power consumption and generation) available at every customer connection point. This paper aims to develop a method to solve the problem of meter placement for low voltage system state estimation through deciding which measurement data from the installed smart meters should be considered in the state estimation algorithms in order to improve on the uncertainty of the estimated voltage and its phase angle at every node in the network.",

Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) has proven to be a very promising solution to cope with this issue. However, few experiments so far have addressed ampacity forecasting, which is critical to allow the integration of DLR in the electricity market processes. To tackle this gap, we developed an algorithm based on real-time DLR measurements and weather forecasts, which provides ampacity forecasts up to two days ahead. This paper describes the results of the EU-funded TWENTIES Demo led in Belgium on two 150kV lines. Currently, the DLR system used provides a two-day ahead ampacity forecast with more than 10% average gain over static rating (dynamic gain forecast varying roughly between 0% and 30%) with 98% confidence. Operational gains allowed by this increase of flexibility are still being assessed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an effective fault location technique is proposed. Using the current samples of the distribution feeder measured at the substation, the proposed technique first determines the type of fault. Furthermore, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained for each type of fault. The ANNs are trained to estimate the fault distance to the substation (FDANN).The Inputs of the ANNs are data of 3 phase voltages, currents and active powers of the feeder are measured at the substation in pre-fault and fault stages. The proposed method does not need data of loads of consumers. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 34-bus test feeder. Each ANN is trained by operating patterns. In order for ANNs cover the total operating space of the radial distribution network; fault location, fault resistance and loads are changed in each pattern. The outputs of ANNs for the operating test patterns, not presented in the training stage, are shown the accuracy of the ANNs. The trained FDANNs can estimate fault distance to the substation; even the structure of the distribution network is changed. Proposed method is effective while the input data are contained errors of measuring.",

This paper proposes a selective particle swarm optimization (SPSO) to solve the optimal capacitor placement problem, the optimal feeder reconfiguration problem, and the problem of a combination of the two. The problem is posed as an optimization problem with an objective to maximize the loss reduction and improve the voltage profile. The optimization procedure is subject to some technical (maximum permissible branch current, maximum and minimum voltage limits and maximum permissible size of capacitors) and operational constraints (load connectivity and radial network structure). The proposed algorithm has been implemented and tested on two test systems from the literatures. The results obtained using the proposed algorithm are compared with the results obtained using different methods given in literature. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In addition, simulation results show that the results of simultaneous capacitor placement and DNR is more effective than considering them separately.",

        "abstract": "Machine-to-machine (M2M) or Machine-type Communication (MTC) is expected to significantly increase in future wireless networks. It exhibits considerably different traffic patterns than human-type communication, thus, claims for new traffic models and simulation scenarios. The challenge in designing such models is not only to accurately capture the behavior of single MTC devices but also to handle their enormous amount (e.g., up to 30 000 devices per cell) and their coordinated behavior. Source traffic models (i.e., each device is modeled as autonomous entity) are generally desirable for their precision and flexibility. However, their complexity is in general growing quadratically with the number of devices. Aggregated traffic models (i.e., all device are summarized to one stream) are far less precise but their complexity is mainly independent of the number of devices. In this work we propose an approach which is combining the advantages of both modeling paradigms, namely, the Coupled Markov Modulated Poisson Processes (CMMPP) framework. It demonstrates the feasibility of source traffic modeling for MTC, being enabled by only linearly growing complexity. Compared to aggregated MTC traffic models, such as proposed by 3GPP TR37.868, CMMPP allows for enhanced accuracy and flexibility at the cost of moderate computational complexity.",

These sensors, based on alternative principles, have been introduced as successors to conventional instrument transformers and in connection with microprocessors based Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) enable many benefits for both users and applications. However, to be able to fully utilize all advantages of MV sensors in MV Switchgear at primary distribution level, the way in which the voltage signal can be distributed in the switchgear has to be found. The IEC 61850-9-2 offers the solution. The combination of digitalization by use of IEC 61850-9-2 and MV Sensors brings a significant change to the way in which MV Switchgears and networks can be built.",

        "abstract": "The concept of Demand Response (DR) has been growing strongly in the last few years. Many projects have been deployed as well in an attempt to push customers and loads to participate more in the power system. One of the most ambitious projects in that area is the EU FP7 project named EcoGrid EU. In this project, it is attempted to use close to real time market prices in order to provide additional balancing resources from flexible consumption. This paper presents the work developed in that project regarding price elasticity and availability of process loads with internal relations and saturation restrictions. An industrial compressed air system, equipped with a compressed air storage unit and an electrical water heater are used as examples of flexible loads. The paper discusses how the volatility in the real time price and the quality of the price forecast consequently affects the energy costs and efficiency of this group of flexible consumer loads. Simulation results, which show the benefits of such system and possible threats to those benefits, are presented.",

        "abstract": "Traditional, largely passive operating paradigm of distributed networks is being challenged by expectations of load growth. As a response, distribution networks operation is moving towards a more active and dynamic approach, in order to enhance security of supply, improve utilisation of existing network assets and to minimise the need for network reinforcements. A spectrum of enabling technologies such as Demand Side Response (DSR) and Energy Storage (ES) can be used to provide distribution network support services, for example voltage and load flow control. In this paper, a methodology for assessing the potential benefits of using ES and DSR to postpone reinforcements of the existing network assets is presented. The methodology is based on a nonlinear multi-period optimal power flow (OPF), where DSR and ES are modelled as a part of the optimisation constraints. DSR is built on a shifting algorithm applied to wet appliances. Storage model optimizes size and location of the ES. The approach is tested on a 11kV distribution network. The obtained results show that DSR and ES may be used for network assets investments deferral, thus more efficiently using the existing network capacity.",

        "abstract": "Onshore wind farms can now be regarded as a mature technology, capable of providing increasing levels of clean energy. The development of offshore wind technology will provide the ability to harness much larger wind energy resource. Offshore wind arrays present many new challenges including the electrical power system which provides the internal collection system and the connection to the on-shore power network. For remote offshore wind farms, high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission will be required to transmit power from the wind farm to the shore. The use of HVDC has the effect of decoupling the wind farms internal collection network from the rest of the power grid, thereby removing the requirement for a conventional alternating current (AC) network. This paper discusses the use of a direct current (DC) collection system for offshore wind farms, with particulars emphasis of DC-DC converter requirements. The proposed converter is validated by the simulation model and the performances e.g. switching losses, conduction losses are investigated.",

This paper investigates modelling the temperature dependence of equivalent circuit parameters. Experiments have been performed on an induction machine to characterise its impedance response (up to 10 MHz) over the temperature range (22.4-210) oC. Using these measurements non-linear parameter estimation is performed using the Nelder-Mead method to derive temperature-dependent models, with an average absolute magnitude error of 270 Ω. The accuracy has been evaluated over the frequency range for the different temperatures and highlights where improvements are needed. This work has important applications in electric machine design and condition monitoring. Also it provides a valuable precursor towards developing age-dependent models for traction based applications.",

This is achieved by 1) Taking a nonlinear approximation of a sparse real-valued dataset at a given tolerance-to-error constraint, c; Choosing an arbitrary lectic ordering on the rows or column entries; And, then systematically applying a closure operator, so that all closures are selected. Assuming a nonnegative hierarchical closure structure (a Galois lattice) ensures the data has a unique ordered overcomplete dictionary representation. Parts-based constraints on these closures can then be used to specify and supervise the form of the solution. We illustrate that this approach outperforms NMF on two standard NMF datasets: it exhibits the properties described above; It is correct and exact.",

The assessment is based on results from Danish failure statistics. It is concluded that there are no significant signs of an increasing failure rate for dry-cured XLPE cables after a service time of a least 30 years. It is also shown that a large part of the failures take place while the system is operated at elevated phase-to-earth voltage on sound phases due to an earth fault somewhere in the system. An analysis also shows that the systems often are operated with an earth fault in 30 minutes or more before the XLPE cable failure occurs, which is interesting when comparing to recommended test duration for power frequency testing of MV cables.",

Two methods are introduced, utilized and compared for power loss calculations: \"Field measurement\" and \"Simulation study\". Afterward some techniques are utilized to minimize technical and non-technical power loss of the studied section. Technical loss is minimized by complete removal of low voltage network and non-technical loss is minimized by Implementation of AMI system. Finally the results of power loss reduction indicate proper planning of this project.",

        "abstract": "Solar energy as a clean and renewable energy gets more and more attention by the international community. Photovoltaic (PV) power generation connected grid is the main development tendency for utilizing solar energy in recent years. Due to discontinuity of PV conversion technology, stability of grid -connected PV power generation is challenged and PV power prediction becomes an effective way to solve these problems. Because the prediction accuracy for solar radiation is the first key problem for the PV power prediction, a solar radiation prediction method based on support vector machine (SVM) with similar data was proposed in the paper. Similar data was extracted from historical data by using pattern recognition with Euclidean distance to create the training samples. Employing to wavelet decomposition, the original solar radiation signal was decomposed into trend signal of low frequency band and random signal of high frequency band. Different SVM radiation prediction models were trained respectively and combined to obtain the final forecasting results. The simulation results show that similar data enhance the relevance of the data and improve the model prediction accuracy Wavelet decomposition reduces the non-stationary parts of solar radiation signals. Different SVM models better approximate the solar radiation characteristics of low and high frequency band and good prediction accuracy is obtained.",

In this paper, economical operation of energy hub including, stochastic wind generation, Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit, boiler, and heat and electricity storages are modelled and analyzed. Responsive loads are used for more flexibility of the studied energy hub.

Its objective is to enable field-testing and research of advanced smart storage technologies in low voltage (LV) distribution grids. The SSS was installed in the LV distribution grid for the purpose of enabling applications such as, but not limited to: the increase of local PV consumption, improvement of reliability and flexibility, reduction of losses, and maximizing the utilization of local infrastructure. In this paper a detailed technical description of the SSU and its subsystems will be presented.",

        "abstract": "Vacuum circuit breakers can cause repetitive transient overvoltages with steep fronts in some cases, depending on the combination of the system configurations and type of circuit breaker operations. Laboratory testing has been performed to improve the understanding of the high frequency system interaction between vacuum circuit breaker, transformer, and cables. A dry type medium voltage transformer has been energized and disconnected in a 20 kV medium voltage laboratory cable system using a vacuum circuit breaker. The transformer is a standard transformer, equipped with additional voltage measuring taps along the disks of one of the high-voltage windings, enabling the measurement of the voltages in the winding when exposed to transient overvoltages. The results show that normal no-load energizing and disconnection of the transformer do not cause any high overvoltages. Disconnection of the transformer with an inductive load or a trip on inrush current during energizing can cause transient overvoltages. Surge arresters, both phases to ground and phase to phase, are recommended for a transformer exposed to these types of circuit breaker operations.",

On the other hand, Renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar power, are becoming significant power generation technologies around the world. However, the intermittency and inherent stochastic nature of renewable resources becomes the major obstacle for reaching a large benefit of them. In this paper, therefore, an operational planning model of a Micro Grid (MG) which considers multiple demand response (DR) programs is proposed. Operation cost and emission are two objectives function in this model that are minimized by epsilon constrain multiobjective optimization. The proposed model has been tested on a typical microgid network over a 24-hour horizon.",

Most of the time, the assumptions are based on measurements taken only at the distribution substation bus or at the feeder head. With widespread application of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) technologies, loading estimates for distribution system analysis can now be based on actual measurements taken at individual loads. This can result in greatly improved accuracy in distribution power flow analysis. Three techniques for load allocation are analyzed and compared to the case with actual AMI data for all customers. Selected details of the test circuit and analysis process are provided.",

        "abstract": "The use of solar panels is becoming more popular in Sweden. Parts of Scandinavia have many sun hours and the cold temperatures are advantageous as they lead to higher efficiencies and longer lifetimes of the solar cells. Except during the darkest time of the year (Nov-Feb) PV is a suitable complement for power production also in the northern parts of Scandinavia, especially when using a proper tracking system In this paper power quality issues concerning the connection of photovoltaic systems will be discussed. Emission up to 25 kHz will be presented as well as voltage variations caused by the production. Measurements from three phase connected plants (20 kW) and from smaller (up to 2.5 kW) single phase connected plants are shown. The harmonic emission from PV-plants is reasonable low and somewhat constant with regards to the production. Some residue from the switching of the inverter can be found typical at a few kHz.",

In Italy this process has already started, the first results show that the grid parity could be achieved in a few years, even if the presence of possible barriers could be delayed or accelerated the grid parity.",

Hence, there is a need for additional response and reserve services. Previous research has shown that frequency-responsive thermostatic loads would be able to support the system, but the proposed control methods typically suffer from undesirable side-effects at the device or system level. We propose a hybrid controller that addresses the observed shortcomings and illustrate its effectiveness using simulations in a model system. Quantitative comparisons are made with two control schemes from the literature.",

In previous works it has already been shown that Compressive Sensing (CS) detectors are capable of jointly detecting both activity and data in Multi-User Detection (MUD). To date, the investigations on CS based MUD have omitted the channel estimation and assumed perfect channel knowledge. However, in practical applications the channel also has to be estimated, such that the joint detection of activity and data has to be extended by channel estimation. Therefore, in this paper we investigate how to adapt several approaches to channel estimation, such that they are suitable for this joint detection and estimation. Further, we provide simulation results, showing that low overhead channel estimation can be achieved, with only a small loss in detection accuracy compared to CS based MUD for perfect channel state information.",

To deal with the problem of extracting radar words from stream of pulse description word(PDW), an extracting method at data level is presented. Firstly, TTP(TOA to PRI) transform method, a pulse sequence analysis method, is improved and expanded. By combining TOA and the other parameters in PDW, multidimensional figure is obtained for joint identification of radar words. Simulation results show that the intuitive method can reduce the effect of drop pulses and false pulses, and extract the radar words of MFR availably.",

Specifically, we investigate and resolve TCP issues that pertain to handovers between wireless networks with varying data rates. New adjustments to TCP's round trip time, congestion window, and acknowledgment mechanism are proposed to ensure seamless handoff. The performances of the proposed cross-layer assisted handoff TCP (TCP-CLAH) are evaluated and compared to those of TCP NewReno (TCP-NR). Our results show that TCP-CLAH outperforms TCP-NR significantly in terms of jitter, round-trip time, and queue size, thereby reducing service disruptions and glitches of ongoing communications substantially during a handoff.",

        "abstract": "Environmental considerations demand alternatives for the current mineral oils used in many electrical equipment, such as transformers. Because of their excellent biodegradability and non-toxicity, relative to petroleum derived products, the use of the vegetable oils is on the rise as insulating and heat transfer liquid in electrical devices. In addition such natural esters have a favourable lower flammability, but their viscosity and low temperature behaviour is not well suited to applications in cold climate and/or with natural cooling system. That is why a new insulating composition, based on modified vegetable oil, has been developed to present very similar properties to those of the standard insulating mineral oils and to meet the specific needs of current distribution transformers. This article presents the formulation of this low-viscosity ester fluid, and it reports the results of the tests carried out to assess its performance in laboratory and real conditions.",

        "abstract": "Power consumption is a critical issue in Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN) applications and typically the energy consumed by the wireless communication dominates. Reducing the WSN node activity and the communication energy can extend the lifetime of the node considerably. This work presents a direct application approach to extend the lifetime of a wireless senor node using a MEMS piezoelectric energy harvesting device in combination with a nano-Watt wake-up radio receiver, in order to build an efficient power device. The design of the power device will be connected to each node as a normal battery bringing the wake-up radio capabilities. Two scenarios were implemented to use the power unit as a wireless switch with harvesters, or to use the power management wake up polices while the MEMS piezoelectric harvester was designed as a power supply directly to the wake up radio receiver. The experimental results and characterization of the muW-MEMS harvester are presented. Finally, measurements on a generic node present the benefits of this approach bringing the power consumption in low power mode down to nano-Watt level (zero power) when the node is not needed in the application.",

        "abstract": "A micro-grid is an autonomous system which can be operated while connected to an external system or isolated with the help of energy storage systems (ESSs). While the daily output of distributed generators (DGs) strongly depends on the temporal distribution of natural resources such as wind and solar, unregulated electric vehicle (EV) charging demand will reduce the imbalance between the daily load and generation curves. In this paper, a statistical model is presented to describe daily EV charging/discharging behaviour. An optimisation problem is proposed and verified to obtain economic operation for the micro-grid based on this model. In day-ahead scheduling, with estimated information of power generation and load demand, optimal charging/discharging of EVs during 24 hours is obtained. A series of numerical optimisation solutions, in different scenarios, is achieved by serial quadratic programming. The results show that with optimal charging/discharging of EVs network losses can be decreased.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the fault characteristic and its formation mechanism of double-fed induction generator (DFIG) are studied, from the point of view of power system relay protection. A new method of analyzing and calculating fault current of DFIG is presented, which combines the advantages of physical process analysis and frequency domain analysis. According to the physical process analysis, the frequency domain equation of DFIG is divided into several equations about zero state and zero input response. By separately solving the several equations, formulas for calculation of the fault current are deduced. These formulas are not only applicable to calculation of short circuit current under symmetrical fault but also unsymmetrical fault. Based on this method, the fault current characteristics of DFIG under symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault are compared. Comparison result shows that AC component of fault current of DFIG under symmetrical fault soon decays end. But AC component under unsymmetrical fault is stable at the end. These new characteristics have an effect on the applicability of the traditional relay protection, and provide a theoretical basis for new methods of relay protection. At the end, simulation results show validity of the proposed formulas under symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault.",

Amid eco-friendly based renewable energy, wind and photovoltaic play a vital role in power generation. Nonetheless, this form of power generation needs more advancement to retrieve optimal power flow under economical conditions. This paper aims to predict optimal sizing for hybrid wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation under minimized cost. This optimal sizing of hybrid Wind-PV is accomplished by satisfying the average annual load demand. This process happens via opposition based genetic algorithm with Cauchy mutation (OGA-CM) and the proposed OGA-CM performance measure is compared with Opposition based Genetic Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm. The result shows that our proposed OGA-GA produces superior result than those of the other two. The overall computation process is done in the working platform of MATLAB R2013.",

These techniques in forecasting aim to help wind producers face the competition in deregulated electricity markets, and in this field the short-term tools are one line of defence for all market players to make acceptable bids, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the electricity system. This paper aims to present a review of the state-of-art reported by the scientific community over the last few years. This is based on forecasting wind power approaches in the short-term, in different regions of the world, with a particular focus on statistical, hybrid, intelligent, and time-series approaches, and reports on the most significant findings reported in journals within this field of knowledge.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents impact of seasonal variation of soil resistivity on performance indices of grounding system. The grounding system initially designed for uniform soil, may become two layer or multilayer soil structure due to seasonal variation such as rainy, early spring and winter season. The formation of low or high resistivity soil layers leads to change grounding grid resistance and affects the most stringent safety criterion like step and touch voltages on the ground surface. The grounding system is extensively analysed for various seasons like raining and freezing in winter considering two layer soil model due to formation of low or high resistivity soil layers. Moreover, safety is analysed using multilayer soil model for some cases. The study reveals that the grounding grid designed for uniform soil may becomes unsafe during freezing and early spring. Therefore, grounding system must be designed very carefully. Use of long vertical ground rods can effectively attenuates the seasonal influence and improves the safety of grounding system. The simulation has been carried out by using Autogrid-Pro grounding software of SES & technology, Canada.",

        "abstract": "Active In-feed Converters (AIC) generate harmonics with frequencies up to 100 kHz resulting in power losses over the distribution lines, transformers and consumer loads, and interferences with control signals. The value of the harmonic voltage at an In-plant Point of Coupling (IPC) depends on the grid impedance at the harmonic frequency. As the spectral impedance of a distribution grid section cannot be estimated by calculation, it has to be measured. This paper presents the “on-line” grid impedance meter designed for spectral impedance measurements of low voltage distribution grids over the frequency range between 2 and 150 kHz. A useful application of spectral grid impedance measurement is presented at the end of this paper, with the analysis of interferences between two photovoltaic inverters.",

        "abstract": "Data transfer is a big overhead for cloud workflows due to pay-as-use business model of cloud environment. In such environment, the cost arising from data transfers between resources as well as execution costs must also be taken into account during scheduling based upon user`s Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. In this paper, we present Priority based Genetic Algorithm BCHGA to schedule workflow applications to cloud resources that optimize the total cost of workflow within the user`s specified budget. Each workflow`s task is assigned priority using bottom level (b-level) and top level (t-level). To increase the population diversity, these priorities are then used to create the initial population of BCHGA. The proposed algorithm is simulated in java and evaluated with synthetic workflows based on realistic workflows from the different areas by considering the pricing model of cloud service provider like Amazon. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has a promising performance as compared to Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA).",

        "abstract": "Based on the distributed energy technology, MicroGrid has caused wide attention. It is of great significance to solve the problem of electricity generation in rural areas by establishing an independent MicroGrid system, which mainly consists of solar energy and wind energy. It becomes crucial to find a way to optimize the structure of MicroGrid according to various energy situations. Based on the analysis of the general structure and operation modes of MicroGrid, a hybrid power model, which containing photovoltaic power system (PV), wind power system (WT) and energy storage battery (BATT), has been established in this article. The optimization model and corresponding calculation method not only provide an innovative research method, but also contribute to the further research and application on design methods and operation modes of the distributed MicroGrid system. According to the model established in the article, a MicroGrid system of a village scale has been analysed as an example. With the help of MATLAB Software, the branch and bound algorithm is used in order to minimize the cost of MicroGrid. The optimal installed capacity of PV, WT and BATT is presented. The generating cost per kWh and power supply reliability are demonstrated in this article as well.",

This system adopts the DDWS method, based on FPGA parallel theory and high-speed DAC framework, to generate the broadband linear frequency signal with bandwidth of 500MHz. The principle of filter-based pre-distortion compensation presented in the paper is used for the amplitude and phase compensation of system, and the ration of the main lobe to the side lobe after pulse compression has a significant improvement. Detailed steps about the implementation are given in this paper.",

Tests by the pilot implementation in Elenia Oy have given promising results. The power transfer capacity of the system has been calculated in the paper using voltage drop and maximum load of cable as boundaries. The branches of the MV network, which can be replaced by LVDC distribution, are determined based on the calculations and mass computation of the whole distribution area of Elenia Oy. Based on the done analysis, it can be inferred that LVDC distribution has a good utilization potential.",

This paper presents a novel data-based phase bias estimation method in time-domain. Firstly, the echoes in time-domain received by the adjacent channels are processed to get interferometric phases, which consist of the Doppler centroid information and the difference of the phase biases between the adjacent channels. Then, the Doppler centroid can be extracted by circular integral of the adjacent interferometric phases. Finally, the phase bias between each channel and the reference one can be obtained by integral of the interferometric phase subtracted by the phase of the Doppler centroid. Using the presented method, both the phase bias and the Doppler centroid of the raw echoes can be effectively estimated. The performance of presented method is validated by the experiments of simulated spaceborne multi-channel SAR data.",

        "abstract": "In this study, crimping factors that have possibilities to affect the contact resistance of medium voltage cable ferrule and lug had been determined and further verified in laboratory experiments. A good crimping is important in order to achieve a very good contact resistance for cable joint (Below 50micro-Ohms). Other than that, good contact resistance between cables joint can reduce the chance of having hotspots that are commonly caused by overheating in cable joint. It was found in most situations that the measurement of contact resistance at site is not possible due to insufficient access to make a measurement. Most of cable failure cases were caused by failure of cable joints. Hence, a better crimping or cable connection method is needed to ensure a good contact in every cable joint. There are few crimping factors that have been pondered in this study and the factors are; (1) Crimping pressure, (2) Number of crimp indents, (3) Location of crimp indents, and (4) Shape of crimp indents. Twenty eight different configuration of compression connectors and bolted connectors for 240 mm2 stranded aluminium cable conductors have been examined in order to identify and clarify the correlations between the designs characteristics, applied pressure, configurations, crimp numbers and other possible parameters to the quality of the connection of ferrule and lug. The quality is assessed with the basis in contact resistance measurement and tensile strength after sample preparation. The results showed that applied pressure does not necessarily contributed to increase of contact resistance, but configuration and crimp numbers does. These results also showed that deep indent crimp is better than hexagonal crimp for 240 mm2 stranded aluminium cable conductors and how different deep indent crimp in terms of quality compared to the inc",

        "abstract": "One challenge facing the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is the reduction of the impact of running out of fuel. An EV, with its limited charging point infrastructure and long charge times, is not seen as being as reliable as a conventional car in this respect. To make EVs more acceptable, forward-looking predictive methods of calculating range need to be developed which also take into account opportunities to conserve or harvest energy, as well as environmental factors such as terrain and weather conditions. Using a well-established EV range simulator, this paper describes scenarios showing the limitations of relying on such an approach and the potential detrimental results to both the driver and vehicle's ability to start and complete a journey. It provides an overview of the research being undertaken by the authors to address these problems, including a description of `Electrikitty', a road legal pure EV that will be used to gather data to verify the development of novel range estimation algorithms.",

Since the entire conventional transistor have junction, which limits it's scaling as it requires very abrupt junction, high concentration gradient and become challenging with every technology node. The problems comes when there is a junction in such a device like MOSFETs which has source junction and drain junction formed with oppositely doped substrate. A junctionless transistor is a uniformly doped nanowire without junction and no doping concentration gradient exist. It shows better short channel effect and less degradation in mobility with temperature, small DIBL, subthreshold swing and higher voltage gain which shows good scalability below 10nm and reduces the fabrication complexity. Junctionless transistor is a very promising candidate for future nano scale MOSFET device.",

This paper first introduces the basic principle and structure of SFCWGBSAR (Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave GBSAR) developed by IECAS (Institute of Electronics Chinese Academy of Sciences), followed by the analysis of imaging principle and performance of SFCW (Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave). Frequency sampling of SFCW utilizes IDFT to realize range compression without match filtering, which simplifies the imaging algorithm, lowers the sampling rate of AD converter and reduces the data size in imaging. A simulation of SFCW range compression is conducted and the result is consistent with the analysis of SFCW's imaging performance. Finally, an experiment is presented and the result verifies the imaging ability of SFCWGBSAR.",

An energy storage device with a bidirectional dc-dc converter connected to the dc link of a fully rated converter based wind turbine is proposed. Different control methods for emulating inertial response to reduce both the rate of change of frequency and frequency nadir are proposed for variable speed turbines. The energy storage is used to smooth the transition of the wind turbines rotor from deceleration to acceleration after inertial response. Matlab/Simulink simulations based on a simple power system have demonstrated the frequency support effect of the proposed methods.",

To reduce the risks of these attacks, various security mechanisms such as encryption and authentication have been proposed. But as we cannot completely eliminate such risks there is a strong need for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). So, in this paper we propose a neural network method based on MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) for detecting normal and attacked behaviour of the system. The method was tested for black hole and gray hole attacks. We have implemented these attacks using NS2 simulator. The method successfully detected these attacks. This paper presents a graphical representation of the results.",

        "abstract": "To satisfy customer's growing service quality expectations and to support, as well, a wide array of additional new services, utilities need to provide high quality power over a complex and interactive grid with greater reliability, efficiency and security. To achieve this complex task, they need to implement new technologies in their power systems, including accommodating distributed generation (DG) and integrating the latest information technologies (IT) including acquisition and communication. This paper presents a new concept of feeder level universal Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED), based on a modular structure, compatible with all major distribution equipments and complying with international standards. Characteristics like interoperability and plug-and-play offered by this IED as default standardized features will allow improvement in the efficiency of existing Smart Distribution applications and will open the gate for the development of new ones. The results of IREQ's project related to the concept and design of such IEDs and their implications are discussed in support of this vision.",

        "abstract": "In a wireless heterogeneous network (HetNet), picocell base stations are deployed by the operators to enhance the network capacity and coverage area. From the perspective of the operators, deployment of the picocell base stations needs to consider minimizing the backhaul cost without degrading the service to users. Multiple picocell base stations can be deployed in areas where signal from the macro base stations does not reach well and backhaul (such as wired or microwave link) links can be established between the picocell base station and the macrocell base station. In case wireless links between picocell base stations are to be established, a careful design is required for both channel allocation and placement of the pico cell base stations. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to analyze the placement of the picocell base stations so that the minimum data rate requirement is guaranteed in the worst-case scenario of interference in the wireless links between the picocell base stations. The model is validated through simulations considering both fading and non-fading channel conditions.",

Second, control system including maximum power point tracking control, voltage and current double-loop control and relay protection control was modelled. Finally, based on a 10MW grid-connected PV power station in the northwest of China, simulations were given to verify the dynamic model and control strategy of PV power station.",

The prototype presented in this paper, consists in automatically running a “playback”, day after day, of the system.

The tool builds dashboards and “snapshots” of each LV network element enabling network resizing or phase-balancing for voltage quality enhancement purpose. The system was used during the 2012 winter on 350 LV networks processing 11 000 individual load curves. Phase-balancing operations are currently being handled on the field.",
