We choose Plucker lines to represent spatial lines and derive a novel fast line projection function based on the relationship between Pl̈ucker line and Plucker matrix. During normal SLAM procedure, the Near by Line Tracking (NLT) method is adopted to track lines and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to predict and update the state of the camera and line landmarks. After each update step, a robust spatial line reconstruction algorithm is used to find new line landmarks and to add them into the map. The SLAM procedure is under supervision and when failure is detected, a recovery method based on the angle histogram of key frames is adopted to relocalize the camera and re-start the SLAM procedure. We demonstrate that our monocular SLAM system is robust to illumination change, partial occlusion and fast camera motion."

It is strong at the center and weak at the terminating ends. To homogenize the B1+ field, it is required to modify the traditional MSR. Recently, an approach based on alternating impedance MSR has been presented. Another configuration of alternating impedance MSR is proposed. Results indicate that, the alternating impedance MSR with circular elements is the best coil in terms of B1+ field homogeneity."

Body-centric wireless communications has abundant applications in personal healthcare, smart home, personal entertainment and identification systems, space exploration and military. The human body is an uninviting and often hostile environment for a wireless signal. In general, antennas suffer from reduced efficiency due to electromagnetic absorption in human tissues, radiation pattern fragmentation and variations in impedance at the feed. Typical geometries of wireless wearable and implantable devices, vary from millimetric to centimetric sizes and, hence, compact yet efficient antennas need to be fully characterized and integrated with the RF transceiver. As well as size there are other significant challenges in the design of antennas for body-centric wireless communications. The objective of this talk is to highlight current and emerging research in antennas and propagation for body-centric wireless communications, as well as applications of this technology."

EMD can self-adjust according to the characteristics of the signal itself, and decompose the signal into IMFs, so that the disturbance can be separated and studied. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), which improved the performance of EMD, overcomes the mode mixing phenomena which restrain the usage of EMD. This paper did a contrast study on power quality detection using EMD and EEMD. It is concluded that EEMD has better effect on detecting some of power quality disturbances."

Detection performance is sensitive to noise. To the characteristic, new energy detection algorithms based on cooperative and dynamic threshold are presented. Simulations show that the proposed schemes outperform traditional algorithms, and cooperative detection is optimal.

This paper presents a novel dual-band bandpass filter (BPF) using half-mode substrate integrated waveguide (HMSIW) technology for the first time. The proposed filter is at least six times smaller than its conventional substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) counterpart. A three-pole dual-band Chebyshev BPF with center frequencies of 1.05 GHz and 1.3 GHz is implemented on RT/Duroid 6010LM substrate. To our knowledge, this filter is the state-of-the-art in dual-band BPFs using SIW technology."

A face detection method based on corner verifying is presented. Firstly, most of the background area is quickly filtered out by skin color detection. Then faces are detected by AdaBoost face detection algorithm combination with skin color detection, but there are some non-faces to be detected. Finally, the faces are verified by corner distribution of human face after Harris corner detection to further reduce the error rate. Experimental results show that this method can efficiently and accurately detect the faces with multi-feature fusion."

I will illustrate each case study with examples and data."

An adaptive extended Kalman filter is proposed, which can filter the random drift error from inertial sensors, and also adaptively compensates external acceleration. External acceleration, which affects attitude estimation based on accelerometers, is a major source of attitude estimation error. The external acceleration error is compensated by adjusting the measurement noise covariance adaptively. The proposed algorithm is verified through experiments."

Nuclear power plants will have fatigue cracks and stress corrosion crack which need of welding repair after long-term running. To reduce the hazards of nuclear radiation on the welding operator and surrounding environment, underwater welding repair must be carried out.

A kind of target recognition system model with three-level data fusion was proposed. In the model, the basic probability assignment function is constructed by neural network and the neural network's outputs as evidence. Evidence combination rules and decision-making rules are used to realize target recognition. The simulation to aircraft target proves that the new designed system model has higher recognition rate and has a certain anti-interference ability."

It could deduce the upper approximation and the lower approximation of image edge sets. And at last, the edge image was obtained using the difference between the two approximation sets. The experimental result shows that the method can successfully preserve the image edge details, make the edge image meticulous and vivid, and have powerful ability in its resistance against noise pollution and better continuity and closure."

Many methods that reduce speckle noise while preserving texture and detail have been developed for SAR and presented in the literature. In this paper, some speckle reduction techniques from SAR images are adapted and applied to SAS high resolution images. A comparison of different methods is performed and new improvements for traditional methods are introduced, considering image quality and better Speckle Suppression Index (SSI). These methods include mean adaptive filter, anisotropic diffusion, Lee filter, Kuan filter and a wavelet-based methodology, which are applied to real SAS high resolution (HR) data collected by NATO Underwater Research Center (NURC) during the COLOSSUS measurement campaign."

A classic design of 1–18 GHz DRHA with exponential ridges is modelled and the antenna pattern deficiencies are detected at frequencies above 12 GHz. The antenna pattern is optimized by modification of the antenna structure. However, the impedance matching is affected and the VSWR is increased at the frequencies below 2 GHz. The matching problem can be resolved by adding lossy materials to the back cavity of antenna. We have shown reduction of the antenna efficiency by 15% over the whole frequency range, except at the lower frequencies."

Unlike previous electronic image stabilization systems, the developed system can divide the global translational vector into dither vector caused by pavement irregularity and vehicle's motion vector. According to different dither vectors, the size of output images will be designed differently. Finally, the experiment indicates that a smooth video can be reached. This is a feasible method with high accuracy."

The proposed structure of the filter is able to achieve 60% size reduction comparing to the traditional structure. In the second, there are a pair of transmission zeros closely to every pass band. Therefore, the selectivity of the filter can be improved. The transmit performance of this filter is simulated by a high frequency full-wave simulator (Ansoft HFSS). It is shown that this structure can generate two operating modes, i.e., the even mode and the odd mode. Finally an experimental filter was fabricated and measured to demonstrate the design. The measured results agree well with the simulated one."

This kind of LQR control method based on genetic algorithms, which can obtain satisfying control results at first hand, is presented for double inverted pendulum system. The method optimizes the Q-matrix by using genetic algorithms, selects trace of the result of Riccati equation as the objective function. The control problem of double inverted pendulum is resolved successfully. The simulation results prove that the control effect by this method is better than the other methods mentioned in the references."
