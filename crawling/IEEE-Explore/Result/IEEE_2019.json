In the experiments using Cityscapes dataset, the images are scaled by various rates and the CNN architecture named DeepLabv3 is trained with different hyperparameters using these images. After the training phase, the success rates of the trained models were compared. The most successful DeepLabv3 model has achieved a success rate of 78.83% on Cityscapes test set. Afterwards, an ensemble of two different DeepLabv3 models and the Extended DeepLabv3 model is tested. In test results, while the success rate remains nearly the same, an increase in classes such as road and sidewalk is observed.",

        "abstract": "Cyberbullying is a rising problem in worldwide and also Turkey is suffering from this problem dramatically. According to researches, the rate of children that are victims of cyberbullying actions in Turkey was tripled in the last seven years and increased to 20%. On the other hand, considering literature there are only a few studies about the detection of cyberbullying in Turkish contents. Thus, we designed eight different artificial neural network models to detect cyberbullying in Turkish social media contents automatically in our study. These models along with various text mining techniques were experimented in the dataset that includes 3000 Turkish tweets. According to the evaluation results, the most successful model for predicting cyberbullying content is YSA2 with 91% F-measure score. Additionally, YSA2 gives better performance than the experimented machine learning classifiers in our previous study.",

A module rated for 10 kA against 40 kV transient interruption voltage has been built and tested at an independent test laboratory, and some test results are presented.",

Integration of the TeraPHY optical technology with open source advanced interconnect bus interface enables communication between chips at board, rack, and row level at the energy and latency cost of in-package interconnect. This enables the design of logically connected but physically separated large-scale and high-performance digital systems. The copackaging integration approach is demonstrated by integrating the TeraPHY die into the Intel Stratix10 FPGA multichip package.",

The background harmonics at either end of the MVDC link is analysed to identify dominant harmonic components. The ac to dc conversion is evaluated with focus on the dc link topology and its harmonic behaviour. This is followed with a detailed power electronic converter switching model implementation for harmonic transfer studies. The modelling aspects resemble the proposed Angle DC converters as close as reasonably practicable. To align with this objective cascaded three level Neutral Point Clamped (NPC)-based MVDC link has been implemented in the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform. The MVDC link is in symmetrical monopole configuration capable of operating at bipolar voltages, resembling the Angle DC link operation. Furthermore, the analysis focused on the different dc link configuration and their behaviour to ac system background harmonics. The results show potential harmonic transfer through the MVDC link.",

        "abstract": "Wireless medical sensor networks are now widely used to make people's lives easier in the healthcare field. Early diagnosis and treatment of diseases before reaching the utmost level is of great importance. In this context, the use of medical sensing devices to prevent diseases is increasing day by day. In this study, a fuzzy logic based coordinator node selection approach is recommended for patients who should be monitored with health data sensor nodes in the hospital environment. The task of a node is to collect data (blood pressure, temperature, etc.) from the sensor devices located on a patient. The task of the coordinator node is to collect the health data of different patients and forward them to the collector station with the aim of monitoring and following-up. If the coordinating node is not selected well, there may be a risk that some of the health data may not be transmitted to the collector station or transmitted incorrectly. For fuzzy logic based coordinator node selection; input parameters such as node energy, node mobility, and data density were taken into account. When the simulation results obtained are analyzed, it is seen that the proposed approach is quite successful in the selection process of coordinator nodes. Besides; compared to arbitrary coordinator node selection systems, it is seen that the probability of incorrect data transmission is greatly reduced.",

Up to now, the VF-control represents a challenge due to static and dynamic limits. This paper provides a dynamic performance, during AC faults, of HVDC link in VF-control connected to an islanded grid. The islanded grid is based on the Northern France network and includes synchronous generator and wind farm. The EMT-type simulations provides an insight on dynamic network behavior when HVDC is operating in VF-control.",

One of these procedures is the segmentation of cell nuclei in digital images obtained in the field of pathology. For the segmentation process, deep-learning can be performed with local small patches obtained from the digital image, and pixel-based systems can be developed by using semantic segmentation technique. In this study, histopathological images obtained from hematoxylin and eosin staining are used for biopsy samples taken for diagnosis of breast cancer. The studies were performed in Matlab environment by using SegNet and U-Net algorithms and the accuracy of semantic segmentation was evaluated comparatively.",

A parallel operation of DRU and VSC topology was modelled in PSCAD/EMTDC in order to assess its behavior in normal as well as transient operation modes. Two active power flow control schemes were developed to control the active power sharing between the DRU and VSC converters. The results show that the VSC provides ancillary services and supports the DRU which makes this concept technically feasible. Moreover, the cost analysis showed a cost reduction potential for this hybrid topology of 8–20 % depending on the scenario over a lifetime of 30 years.",

        "abstract": "The digitization of industrial automation processes calls for flexible, adaptable, and scalable communication solutions in order to enable the vision of a truly \"cyber-physical system\". In this context, IEEE Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), developed by the TSN task group of the IEEE 802.1 working group, receives particular interest as it defines mechanisms for the time-sensitive (i.e., deterministic) transmission of data over Ethernet networks. In order to enable novel use cases and further improve the efficiency of industrial automation, mobile communication solutions are needed. Here, the time-sensitive communications (TSC) service in 3GPP Release 16 aims to support applications requiring deterministic or isochronous communication with high reliability and availability, such as IEEE TSN and IETF DetNet, over 5G mobile networks. This paper briefly depicts the favorable deployment scenarios for an integrated 5G/TSN system in Industry 4.0 environments. It further describes the requirements in integrating a 5G system (5GS) with an IEEE TSN system and depicts the 3GPP integrated system architecture, which foresees to present the 5GS to the TSN system like any other TSN-aware bridge. Subsequently, the focus of this paper lies on presenting remaining challenges as well as solutions to a subset of these challenges, particularly focusing on radio access, core, and network management aspects as well as QoS mapping framework.",

However, testbeds and especially those which are built using real-world infrastructure are expensive to develop and maintain. Moreover, such testbeds tend to be representative of a single industry vertical (often based upon the skill set or research focus) and built in isolation. In this paper we present a reference architecture, developed whilst designing and building the Bristol Cyber Security Group ICS/IIoT testbed for critical national infrastructure security research.",

Portfolio optimization problems offer minimum risk and maximum profit-based solutions to help investors on optimal investment. Current researches have focused on PSO and GA algorithms based on Markowitz's mean variance method. This paper examines the implementation of PSO and GA algorithms to solve the optimization problem of two portfolios, Borsa Istanbul (BIST) and Cryptocurrency Exchange (KPB). This study also uses Markowitz mean variance method, that is, variance method for risk minimization and mean method for profit maximization. PSO and GA varying coefficients are compared in terms of sharpe risk percentage and portfolio profit. The comparison result is in favor of PSO algorithm.",

        "abstract": "HVDC grids are expected to be a solution to upgrade the existing AC system. However, their development presents several technical challenges like power flow control, grid protection and interconnection of grids with different technology or voltage levels. One required technology for the development of such grids is the DC-DC converter capable of operating at hundreds of kilovolts and hundreds of megawatts. While different DC-DC converter topologies have been proposed in literature, most studies focus on the topology itself and there is a lack of studies that deal with their grid integration. This paper studies the role of DC-DC converters in the protection of HVDC grids acting as firewalls to stop the propagation of faults. The effects of blocking the converter or actively controlling its operation during faults are presented. The results demonstrate the capabilities of DC-DC converters beyond DC voltage transformation.",

        "abstract": "In today's world, time is the most valuable asset and this paper focuses on developing a smart parking system for smart cities. Its main objective is to assist users to find a vacant location of car parking in a shorter time. The system displays occupied and vacant parking spots on LCD, making it convenient for the users to park. This parking system is based on sensors and cloud server integration. The working principle is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the ultrasonic sensor is used to detect vacant or occupied car parking space and display it on the screen using cloud technology. In the second phase, the improper parking of the car is detected by IR sensors. It alerts the driver with a buzzer if the car is not parked in the parking boundary. Moving further, some important features of this parking system are also discussed followed by, components required and their description. Towards the end of the paper, this parking system is compared with other alternative smart parking systems, the comparisons prove the correctness of our system over others.",

The stability limit of the system as a function of the Power Ratio (PR) between the CCI and ESM and the electrical distance between both was identified using a method proposed in this paper. Furthermore, the impact of the operating point of the CCI on the stability limits of the system was also investigated.",

One of the most important roles in ensuring energy efficiency for the WSN is creating clusters between sensor nodes. Choosing the most appropriate sensor node as Cluster Head (CH) among the clustered sensors according to the predetermined criteria decreases the energy consumption. In this study, the most frequent clustering algorithms in the literature are included and these algorithms are compared based on certain metrics. As a result of the comparison, advantages and disadvantages of clustering algorithms are indicated.",

However, in experimental realization axial junction solar cells have shown better performance as compared to their core-shell junction counterpart, at least in the case of III-V materials. Herein, we demonstrate nanowire solar cell utilizing a p-type InP as core and ZnO/AZO as shell in excess of 15% efficiency. We show that AZO/ZnO provides passivation to InP while ensuring electron selectivity and thus leads to the highest ever reported external quantum efficiency for InP-based nanowire solar cells.",

Haar, which is frequently used for vehicle detection in literature and tail lights or rear vision of vehicles are used for detection. However, these algorithms are mostly for daytime vehicle detection. In this paper, we present an algorithm and experimental results for, Haar cascade classifier and rule based image processing combination for nighttime vehicle tail light detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method detects with high accuracy than most of vehicle tail light detection algorithms that using a single classifier.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a comprehensive Model-Predictive-Control (MPC) controller that enables effective complex track maneuvering for Self-Driving Cars (SDC) is proposed. The paper presents the full design details and the implementation stages of the proposed SDC-MPC. The controller receives several input signals such as an accurate car position measurement from the localization module of the SDC measured in global map coordinates, the instantaneous vehicle speed, as well as, the reference trajectory from the path planner of the SDC. Then, the SDC-MPC generates a steering (angle) command to the SDC in addition to a throttle (speed/brake) command. The proposed cost function of the SDC-MPC (which is one of the main contributions of this paper) is very comprehensive and is composed of several terms. Each term has its own sub-objective that contributes to the overall optimization problem. The main goal is to find a solution that can satisfy the purposes of these terms according to their weights (contribution) in the combined objective (cost) function. Extensive simulation studies in complex tracks with many sharp turns have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller at different speeds. The analysis shows that the proposed controller with its tuning technique outperforms the other classical ones like PID.",

In this study, using data from 1 January 2016 to 9 May 2019 date and some bank stocks have been tried to predict the closing prices of the next day. The decision tree and multiple regression methods were used in developing the estimation model due to finding linear patterns in stock movements. Two different sets of input variables were used for the models created with these methods. There are 50 indicators consisting of 46 techniques and 4 fundamental indicators in the first input variable set. The second input variable set, as a result of the reduction in technical indicators there are a total of 33 indicators consisting of 29 technical indicators and 4 basic indicators. For these two different input variable sets, the estimation performance of both models was evaluated by the R2 criteria. When the R2 results were analyzed, it was seen that the reduction in the technical indicator had a positive effect on the predictive performance of the models.",

The validity of the PML formulation is demonstrated on a canonical case of a metal waveguide and compared with an existing PML TLM scheme.",

        "abstract": "The scarcity of clean water resources in the world requires the optimum use of these resources. Intelligent management of water plays an important role in improving irrigation efficiency and improving efficiency for quality. Irrigation is often done by conventional methods. However, traditional methods cannot ensure that the soil has the same humidity. As a result of the use of technology in the field of irrigation, the multidisciplinary concept Internet of Things (IoT, Internet of Things) closes this gap in the physical world. In this paper, an IoT based irrigation system consisting of two sub-systems as control and cloud system has been designed and realized for the pilot area. Environmental conditions in the irrigation system has been monitored using temperature, soil moisture, and rain sensor. The sensor node data are gathered wirelessly via cloud using ThingSpeak. Then, data collected in the cloud are processed instantaneously and according to the commands transmitted by the cloud system, the control system provides to water as much as the plant needs.",

Some of intelligent edge devices also become equipping ASIC or IP cores including such massively parallel multiply-accumulators optimized for specific machine learning applications at low-power consumption. This presentation introduces our current research activities in analog-based machine learning accelerators and analog-based spiking neural network processors aiming at high performance per power in machine learning applications by taking advantage of high-speed and low-power analog multiply-accumulation arithmetic over densely-packed synaptic non-volatile memory (NVM) resistive device arrays.",

        "abstract": "We use technological developments in education and adapt technology to education. Educational computers, tablets, smart phones and other technological devices that integrate with these devices aim to increase the quality of education within the scope of computer-aided training. At the same time, with the development of the Internet, it has become much easier to access resources. The environments where the hardware and software technologies used in education are used together can be considered as intelligent classes. Video conferencing and live broadcasts used in the first smart classrooms have now turned into different applications. Intelligent classes that support learning with robotics, mobile learning, virtual reality and augmented reality applications, and different learning environments and materials are used today to improve the quality of education. The Individualized Smart Class (BAS) application proposed in this study is designed in two steps, hardware and software. It is envisaged to use laptop computers, microphones, headphones, tablets and virtual reality glasses in the classroom as hardware. At the same time the broadband of the classes will be ensured to have the internet. Even in this class, wireless network systems such as infrared, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi can be used. As a software, a class that can be included in the virtual classes with cloud architecture and can use the increased reality applications is considered. In addition, mobile applications that provide virtual reality will enrich the course materials. With this application, equality of opportunity will be provided for disadvantaged students in education and training, quality of education will be improved and it will be beneficial for the development of our country in this context.",

Indeed, many IoT devices have been found collecting consumers' personal data without their knowledge or consent. While frameworks for identifying and mitigating security concerns of IoT devices and services are available, there is a lack of frameworks that address privacy issues for IoT applications. In this paper we lay the foundations for the future development of such a framework, based on both the experimental analysis of data flows on an IoT Smart Home testbed and a systematic analysis of other frameworks.",

This is especially valid, if bipolar schemes with dedicated metallic return or rigid bipolar configurations are utilized. In case of the latter configuration a floating neutral bus between positive and negative converter exists at one terminal. Therefore, new challenges in control and system design arise. While bipolar configurations with dedicated metallic return are well studied, investigations on the rigid bipolar configuration have been rarely addressed in literature. This paper presents the main differences as well as characteristic control and balancing aspects of the rigid bipolar configuration.",

In order to carry out the measurements in the laboratory environment, a model silo corresponding to 8% of the actual commercial silo was produced by a 3D printer and the radar measurements were performed in the frequency band of 18 - 40 GHz. In the proposed method, 2000 back scattering information belonging to different levels of grain were collected and they were used as input data to the extreme learning machine (ELM). The accuracy of the algorithm was obtained by K-fold cross validation technique. As a result, the ELM algorithm was determined the grain amount with an accuracy rate of 84%. The results show that the measurement system based on machine learning is more practical than traditional methods.",

MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) is a light weight protocol used for communication between IoT devices. It is being extensively used in a low bandwidth environment (e.g. smart cities, home automation, etc.). There are multiple vendors for clients and brokers which are used for publishing/subscribing to topics and which act as an intermediate server respectively. As different brokers are developed by different developers, it may have different implementation flaws which impact the security of the communication between IoT devices in various ways. In this paper, we analyze various brokers available on internet from security point of view by performing DoS attack and information gathering techniques on the broker, compare the outcomes and try to find out the least vulnerable broker that can be used for secure communication between IoT devices.",

To determine the character and emotion of people by analyzing their behavior is already an important task for especially human resources. If a person's body language is adequately analyzed, much information can be obtained about that person's personality traits. The main task of this study is to predict the five factor model personality dimensions from video images by using machine learning techniques and artificial neural networks. In this study, video images and the emotional states of the person obtained from videos were utilized and an artificial intelligence based system was developed to be able to predict automatically the personality traits of a person from videos with 0,8951 accuracy by using artificial neural networks, machine learning and image processing techniques. Within the scope of the study, prediction of 5 important personality traits, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness were emphasized.",

In this paper it is explained how the FMEA can be used to define and assess the impact of the failure modes (FM) of a protection strategy for High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) grids. The risk assessment of HVDC protection strategies is important because, despite of being very unlikely, the occurrence of failures during the fault clearing can cause impacts of great severity to the system. Equations for the likelihood and methods to measure the severity of FMs are discussed in the paper. A non-selective protection strategy is used to illustrate the method and the meaning of the risks assessed are discussed.",

Generally, supervised learning methods are used for information extraction and classification. Supervised learning is based on the training set that classification algorithms are trained. In the proposed approach, keyword extraction solution is proposed to classify text data more convenient. The developed solution is based on the Word2Vec algorithm, which works by taking into consideration the semantic meaning of the words unlike general approaches that based on word frequency. A new approach, word embedding algorithm named “Word2Vec”, works by calculating the word weights, semantic relationship, and the final weights of vectors. The obtained keywords are trained with Naive Bayes and Decision Trees methods and the performance of the proposed method is shown by classification example.",

        "abstract": "The challenges in industrial settings have remained the same for the last 50 years. Operations leaders are being asked to deliver more across KPIs—such as throughput, costs, efficiency, quality, and sustainability—and asked to deliver incremental improvement every year.The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has brought much promise: more sensors, more connectivity, more data, better controls, more tools and methods to make sense of the data, and a greater understanding of consequences. But for all its promise, results have been stubbornly slow. Assets are increasingly complex, inter-dependencies are difficult to understand and real-time externalities are impacting these systems--often with unforeseen consequences.The confluence of AI and advanced analytics, however, can get business leaders the transformational results they desire. These technologies can break through data silos and analyze your operations holistically to provide deeper insights that humans and advanced controls can act on. And it can all happen in real-time. AI and advanced Analytics can help you better visualize the butterfly effect, understand how decisions about maintenance of one asset will impact another, and help business leaders to obtain the agility their businesses so desperately need.",

It is difficult to identify fraudulent transactions among the vast amount of credit card transactions. Although credit card fraud is limited in number of transactions, it causes serious problems in terms of financial losses for individuals and organizations. Even though large number of studies has been conducted to solve this problem, there is no generally accepted solution. In this paper, a publicly available data set is used. The unbalance problem of the data set was solved by using hybrid sampling methods together. On this data set, comparative performance evaluations have been conducted. Different from other studies, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric, which expresses the success in such data sets, has also been used in addition to standard performance metrics. Since it is also important to quickly detect credit card fraud transactions; the running time of different methods is also presented as another performance metric.",

The method extracts the thermal-impedance frequency response function of power modules over a wide bandwidth in real-time without interrupting normal converter operation. The obtained thermal-impedance information allows identifying different degradation mechanisms of power modules, e.g. delamination of the power devices and the DCB as well as a deterioration of the convection process. Thus, this method serves as a sensor for remote state-of-health monitoring of power modules enabling predictive maintenance for safer and more reliable future converter systems.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the influence of cutting edges on the core losses and magnetizing demand is illustrated. First, measurements are done of the magnetic properties of electrical steel test strips with different widths in the Single Sheet Tester (SST). The cutting techniques water jet cutting (WC) and wire eroding (WE) are investigated in order to receive reference meas-urement results. Guillotine shearing (GS) is considered because it is the standard method to produce test strips for the SST at the electrical steel sheet producers. Laser cutting (LC) is examined in face of prototyping of electrical machines. The focus of the measurements are test strips stamped with an industrial cutting tool (IC). The results from the measure-ments are integrated in an analytical and numerical electromagnetic model in [1]. The results of this paper are a part of [2].",

        "abstract": "In operation and planning of electrical grids, it is essential to account for temporal fluctuation of produced and consumed electric energy. Time series based studies often use standardized load profiles for this, which, however, cannot accurately represent the individual peak patterns in load and demand and their random combinations. As part of the SimBench project, we developed a dataset of energy time series to be assigned as individual profiles to grid nodes in high voltage (HV), medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) grids to calculate local power flows in a more realistic way. Load profiles are classified and assigned to categories on the basis of similarity to standard load profiles to represent a broad range of energy users and generation profiles were created using weather data and an agent-based simulation tool. The subset presented in this paper comprises different 77 one-year-profiles with a 15 minute resolution, containing commercial consumers, household consumers, storage, and production units based on real measurements from Germany with a focus on MV and LV levels.",

As result, we are moving from a classical electromechanical system to a fully electronic driven system. This change is significantly affecting the dynamics of the power system but also opening completely new opportunities. The presentation will introduce recent studies in the field of dynamic integration of inverters in power grids showing that power electronics can be seen more as opportunities than as a problem. While a full concept of automation for future power system is still part of research, interesting options are emerging showing how the future power electronics-based power system could be actually more reliable than the classical power system.",

        "abstract": "High voltage direct current (HVDC) cable systems are used as long distance electric energy transport solutions, when HV powerlines are not applicable, e.g. in urban or offshore scenarios. The thermal material characteristics of the surrounding environment show an influence on the temperature distribution inside the cable insulation. With a constant applied voltage and due to a nonlinear electric conductivity of the cable insulation space charges accumulate inside the cable insulation. The nonlinear electric conductivity depends on the temperature and on the electric field, resulting in a stationary electric field inside the cable insulation depending on the material characteristics of the surrounding environment. Numerical simulations are used to solve the coupled electro-thermal field problem. Due to neglected insulation losses and different dimensions of the cable and the environment and thus, different spatial resolutions, the temperature and the electric field are computed in weakly coupled simulations. Simulation results show an increasing temperature gradient inside the cable insulation with increasing humidity and thus, with increasing thermal conductivity. With increasing humidity, the electric field increases at the sheath and decreases at the inner conductor of the cable. The change in the electric field contributes to an increased space charge density.",

Given the cost and accuracy of these systems, BLE technology is low in cost and easy to locate in the environment. However, accuracy is lower in server-based systems. In order to solve this problem, the system we propose is based on filtering the data, performing RSSI-distance estimation and estimating the position using WCL algorithm. In the system, positions were obtained with an average error of 0.5 m near the gateway, 2.42 m between the gateways and 2.29 m in the middle of the plan.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. Photonic integration on membranes is a promising solution to heterogeneously combine electronic and photonic functionalities in a single chip. The InP membrane on Silicon (IMOS) platform is an advantageous solution for this, since it can integrate all active and passive devices, such as lasers, detectors and high-index-contrast waveguides, in a single membrane layer. One of the most important components of the platform is the low noise single mode laser. In this work we present a quarter-wavelength shift single mode distributed feedback (DFB) laser with high side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) for the IMOS platform. The DFB grating is defined on top of the semiconductor optical amplifier and has pitch of 240 nm for 1550 nm lasing wavelength. Refractive index difference in single pitch is Δn = 0.1%. In order to the kL=4, the length of the laser should be 1 mm. The laser has a 50 mA threshold current and 2.5 kA/cm2 threshold current density. The laser is featuring very high SMSR of 60 dB. The maximum output power in the cavity is estimated to be 20 mW. High SMSR and low noise of the laser opens a number of potential applications for coherent communication, spectroscopic sensing and optical metrology.",

It argues that in the more recent nodes, the total chip power (energy-per-operation) has scaled much less than that of earlier CMOS nodes. If the present trends continue, it will spell challenge in continuing Moore's Law. Improving the chip power scaling in the future nodes is critical, especially as it relates to high performance microprocessors.",

Yet, the SCADA system is often affected by various factors, such as the sensor failure and network congestion, resulting in the data loss. In this paper, a statistical learning framework is developed to intelligently impute the SCADA missing data of an offshore wind farm, which is of a high dimension and a long time span. The framework mainly consists of three parts: (1) the data pre-processing based on correlation analysis; (2) the model training and verification based on a novel integration of the feature selection, candidate models, and virtual sensor principles; as well as (3) the missing data estimation and data post-processing. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality as well as the industrial application value of the developed statistical learning framework.",

The application of Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) ensures a controlled power exchange between both systems. This enables a combined system operation and therefore a combined security assessment of both systems. This work proposes a Preventive Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow (PSCOPF), which adapts VSC set-points (pVSC and uDC) and their droop gain of the DC voltage control in order to increase the overall system security by minimizing the number of critical contingencies. Thereby, all possible equipment outages are considered in the N-1 analysis. The PSCOPF method is based on a Differential Evolution algorithm. Furthermore, it is investigated if VSC set-points and droop gains can be optimised simultaneously or in a staggered approach.",

Artificial intelligence is more and more responsible for decisions that have a huge impact on our lives. But predictions made using data mining and algorithms can affect population subgroups differently. Academic researchers and journalists have shown that decisions taken by predictive algorithms sometimes lead to biased outcomes, reproducing inequalities already present in society. Is it possible to make a fairness-aware data mining process? Are algorithms biased because people are too? Or is it how machine learning works at the most fundamental level?",

        "abstract": "This study reports the development of an ac current sensing technique using a capacitance sensing UHF RFID tag which is integrated with a current transformer (CT). A new tag antenna design is created to integrate with the CT housing while maintaining the tag link. The terminals of the capacitance sensing RFID chip are connected to a tuning circuit with a reactance controlled by the current flow in the primary of the CT. A prototype tag was tested to validate the battery-free compact tag that streams current measurement data over a read range of about 5 m using the European RFID UHF band at 868 MHz. The tag could be used for wirelessly sensing the load current of an individual domestic appliance and where a single reader could simultaneously monitor multiple tags, enabling smart reading of electricity consumption across multiple devices in smart homes.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method to represent transmission lines and cables in state space. The method accounts for the frequency dependency of line parameters and essentially translates the state of the art time-domain universal line model into state space. The proposed model is compared against the latest state space model for single DC cable and a bipolar DC cable and it shows certain advantages. DC cables are represented without applying Kron reduction which means that a higher accuracy can be achieved. Single DC cable is represented with a lower model order and higher accuracy for a wide spectre of upper frequency limits and cable lengths. The longer the cable and the higher the upper frequency limit, the more pronounced is the model order reduction. The two state space models are also compared for a 70km bipolar DC cable in the frequency range up to 1 kHz and the proposed model achieves higher accuracy with a slightly lower model order. More importantly, the proposed model succeeds at representing the effect of mutual coupling within the desired accuracy criteria. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the two-conductor DC cable (bipolar cable), it is shown that the proposed method overcomes the issue to represent unbalanced multi-conductor lines and cables in state space. The reason is that it avoids modal transformation. Moreover, in case of multi-conductor lines and cables, it is expected that the proposed method is beneficial for longer systems, higher upper frequency limits and for more mutually coupled conductors.",

The functioning of this communication system is possible thanks to various IoT protocols. In this study, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee and Z-Wave that wireless network protocols are described. Explaining the structure of these protocols, the features such as coverage area, data transmission speed, power consumption and usage areas are compared. At the same time, it is aimed that the study will be a general information source for researchers who want to learn about wireless network protocols.",

        "abstract": "Until a machine learning algorithm is finalized and can be used in an application or product, many development steps have to be performed. Same of the more time consuming steps are the preparation of data sets for training and testing and the optimization of the algorithms. Afterthese steps, the trained model only needs to be integrated into the application code in most cases. For self-learning systems the development process does not end at this point. The reason for that is the execution context. The environments, where self-learning systems are deployed, are often dynamic and, to a certain degree, unpredictable. Smart homes and road traffic are good examples of such environments. To ensure the proper functioning of machine learning models in such contexts, support from the systems is necessary. lt must be able to perform tasks like distribution of computation and verifying the predictions of the trained machine learning models. Furthermore, the support infrastructure of the system must deal with the incremental or on-site training of the models. In case of systems at the network edge, this means training and adapting models with limited resources. Organizing, maintaining and adapting this kind of support can be quite difficult. The microservice architecture has the potential to reduce these challenges for systems at the network edge. In this paper, we discuss this potential at the example of the OpenLicht system, a self-learning lighting system at the network edge. Furthermore, solutions based on micro services for machine learning support are presented and we evaluate the microservice pattern against other architectural patterns.",

Within the last few years, high-resolution medical imaging technologies have grown in popularity for research in software engineering in general and program comprehension in particular. New approaches such function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) complement more established approaches such as eye tracking and electroencephalograms (EEG), helping us to augment unreliable or subjective self-reporting with more objective measures of the neurobiological correlates of software engineering. This keynote summarizes recent exciting results using such techniques, from multiple authors, contrasting them to more traditional studies. We highlight the “game changing” areas of program comprehension that can be more rigorously targeted with these approaches (including expertise, efficiency, and problem difficulty, among others). We also lay out a number of the challenges associated with such studies (including experimental design, statistical analysis, regulatory compliance, reproducibility, and cost, among others). We conclude with a call to arms, surveying compelling ideas and experiments from psychology that have not yet been applied to program comprehension research.",

        "abstract": "The cellular industry has evolved to 5th generation (5G) since its first generation launched in 1978, Roughly, a generation of cellular system is created every 10 years. Since ITU officially defined service category and key performance indicators in 2015 (2-3 years after the concept was 1st brought up), the progress of the standard specifications and industrial development have moved fairly fast. 3GPP has released R15 5GNR technical specification for NSA (Non-Stand Alone) and SA (Stand Alone) by now and is expected to release R16 specification by the end of 2019. The industry is geared for 5G field trials, and launch ofcommercial services in 2019 and 2020. In the meantime, field trials/testbeds for non-traditional vertical applications are also being deployed worldwide to explore new services and to create new business models associated with these services. Though commercial launches of 5G services are expected in 2020-2021 time frame, it is a general consensus that eMBB service will be offered initially. It is also believed that 4G and 5G networks will likely co-exist and remain complementary for many years from operator point of view. Once 5G commercial system is launched, what will be next beyond 2020-21?In this talk, an overview ofworld-wide 5G activities including standardization, trials, spectrum policy will be presented first followed by summary of on-going/planned field trials/testbeds in Taiwan. We will then discuss \"what next\" from short term and long term perspective.",

The Altdorfer Flexmarkt - a smart market platform - is a concept for the utilization of flexibility, their efficient use and the assurance of a coordinated call-off. The paper starts with a meta-study of comparable smart market concepts and their basic principles. Combined with today's operational planning processes for grid operators the smart market concept used for the Altdorfer Flexmarkt is derived. Its functionality is afterwards described by an explanation of the basic structure and key modules.",

        "abstract": "Transients of a typical grid synchronizing VSC are closely associated with the over-current and over-voltage in circuits. Previous analysis in evaluating such transient phenomenon usually ignore the nonlinear control effects of the VSCs (e.g. phase-locked-loop, PLL). Although this assumption allows a simpler analysis of the transient process, it may overlook potential stability issues on which the nonlinear controls may a great impact and the consequence of which is easily confused with the passive circuit transients. Therefore, this work aims to achieve a good understanding of the nonlinear control dynamics of the VSC and their impacts on the stability provoked by the grid voltage sags. To better reveal the mechanisms, the power control loop (PCL) and the PLL-dominant dynamics are analysed separately with corresponding reduced-order nonlinear models. From which the grid synchronizing stability of the VSC is revealed, and a quantitative study of stability margin is presented through the calculation and evaluation of the critical clearing time (CCT). Based on this, CCT under various PLL bandwidths are evaluated, the results of which could facilitate the parameter design of PLL from a stability viewpoint. All the analyses are verified by time-domain simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC.",

However, the frequent use of this virtual environment generates in many cases negative outcomes that are created by malicious users who take advantage of the impunity and anonymity image that this network grants them. For this motive, WhatsApp has been involved as evidence in legal proceedings. When it is accepted as evidence in judicial proceedings it must be taken into account that it has been demonstrated that the messages of this social network can be manipulated without leaving no traces due to there are some vulnerabilities it the system. For the reasons describe before, the present paper is based in a bibliographical research in which the knowledge is broaden and the elements of analysis in order to verify that the sending and reception of messages are a valid evidence provide by a computer technician by delivering and expert report in a legal proceeding.",

        "abstract": "Visual impairment students become a challenge for teachers in different learning environment at university. This challenge increases when the teaching and learning process is related to the learning of a second language, due to the absence of educational resources available in any educative institute and the lack of knowledge of appropriate methodologies and didactic strategies to develop the different English linguistic skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing). According to this problem, the present research is proposed by a new methodology strategy, based on the usage of a meaningful learning and the emerging technologies to lead and encourage visual impaired students to learn the English language process, thus, a route map of an educational innovation is presented for teachers who run into visual impairment students in heterogeneous classroom environment, this will stablish a holistic communication allowing an active and students' autonomous participation.",

Dense network architectures with high dynamicity in its highly populated links call for a distributed rather than a centralized approach so that the respective monitoring functionality should be integrated in all network terminals. In order not to introduce additional cost, we propose to re-use a transmitter that is widely adopted in direct-modulation / direct-detection systems as a spectral monitor. We experimentally demonstrate that an externally modulated laser is offering the functionality of a continuously tunable coherent receiver in order to down-convert optical signals to the RF domain for subsequent narrowband slicing and power integration. Modulation spectra for on-off keyed signals at different data rates and pulsed signals can be correctly acquired over a spectral range of 320 GHz, in virtue of the high resolution that the proposed coherent spectrum analyser is offering. The errors in wavelength and magnitude are less than 36 pm and 4.6 dB, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The Zhangbei ±500kV DC pilot project is the world's first modular multilevel converter based DC grid project, which integrates large scale wind power over long distance using the overhead lines. Once DC fault occurs on the overhead line, fault currents rise rapidly with a large amplitude, which requires fast trip of DCCBs to isolate faulted lines. To suppress the fault current rise rate and leave more time for fault detection, the current-limiting reactors (CLR) are implemented on both polar and grounding poles in the Zhangbei project. This paper analyses the impacts of grounding pole (G-CLR) on the DC line protection and the fault characteristics of the voltage across G-CLRs under bus faults. In addition, a DC bus protection scheme using G-CLRs is proposed. In order to verify the correctness of analysis and effectiveness of the proposed scheme, extensive simulations have been conducted under PSCAD/EMTDC.",

        "abstract": "The transient overvoltage appears commonly in LCC-HVDC infeed power system and could lead to tripping of adjacent PV and cascading failures, especially in the peak stage. The current solutions mainly focus on improving short circuit capacity and the response of reactive power compensation devices. However, these solutions need extra devices or could not response rapidly to the voltage peak. Thus, this paper proposes an additional emergency control strategy of PV to suppress overvoltage peak, which utilizes PV's rapid adjustment capacity. The topology of a practical system and controls of key devices are introduced first. Then, the process of transient recovery overvoltage peak is analysed. Further, an emergency control strategy is proposed. An additional signal, which is formed by the error between terminal voltage measurement and its reference, is attached to the output voltage reference of PV to provide emergency reactive power support. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy are validated by simulation results.",

The proposed technique is well suited for use in Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) applications or Self-Driving Cars (SDC). The main emphasis of the proposed technique is the precision and the predictability in identifying the driving lane boundaries (linear or curved) and tracking it throughout the drive. Moreover, the technique provides fast enough computation to be embedded in CPUs with affordable GPUs that are employed by ADAS systems. The proposed technique is mainly a pipeline of reliable computer vision algorithms that augment each other and take in raw RGB images to produce the required lane boundaries, which represent the front driving space for the car. Moreover, some of the employed algorithms are working in parallel to strengthen each other in order to produce a sophisticated output. Each used algorithm is described in details, implemented and its performance is evaluated using actual road images and videos captured by the front mounted camera of the car. The whole pipeline performance is also tested and evaluated on real videos. The evaluation of the proposed technique shows that it reliably detects and tracks road boundaries under various conditions.",

        "abstract": "To solve the problem of excessive short-circuit current with the development of 500kV power grid, also the voltage drop and power loss caused by typical current limiting reactor, a novel fault current limiter, which combines highly coupled split reactor (HCSR) and paralleled circuit breakers, has drawn intense attention due to its superior properties of trigger-free, high current limiting ability and low normal operation loss. This paper mainly focuses on system working conditions of the novel fault current limiter in Guangdong Power Grid from the perspective of system analysis. For this, an electromagnetic transient model of 500kV fault current limiter with HCSR is built in EMTP, the key technical requirements such as electrical parameters, operating voltage, overvoltage level are clarified, the transient recovery voltage (TRV) of breakers are analysed. The results show that the TRV peak and the rate of rise of TRV are much higher than the allowable values of the circuit breaker test in the current standard. Suppression measures, such as installation of opening resistors or capacitances in parallel with circuit breakers, are proposed at last. Conclusions obtained in this paper can be used to guide the production and manufacture of 500kV fault current limiter.",

        "abstract": "The oscillation phenomena in the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) based HVDC system has caused severe damage to the related devices and grids. The fundamental causes of the oscillations can be very sophisticated depending on the configuration and control operation of the system. Therefore, an impedance model of the MMC was proposed while considering the dynamic characteristic of each control loop and the overall signal delays in the control scheme. The results have shown that, the current inner loop, active power control loop and the overall signal delays have great impacts on the impedance characteristics of the converter. The impacts of the control loops and the delay times have been demonstrated by deriving the impedance model of the MMC and compared to the measured impedance curve, which was obtained by frequency scanning method. The consistence between these two curves have proven the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed impedance model.",

Since the classification algorithms in the literature show bias according to the number of observations of the classes, various methods have been developed in order to solve this problem. Existing methods in literature can lead to various problems such as generation of noise while allowing the solution of this problem. In this study, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), which is widely used in imbalanced classification problems, is discussed with Boosting. Using the proposed approach, the noise problem after SMOTE is solved with the help of Boosting procedure. This approach was implemented using C4.5 decision tree method on 5 different datasets. As a result of the application, the average performance of F1 score, AUC and G mean increased.",

Factors such as system parameter changes, system operating condition changes, filtering, and delays in the measurements, may adversely affect the performance of a circuit in which the controller design is not immune to such disturbances. In this paper, the internal model design concept is explored as a viable approach for designing controllers with improved performance despite system variations. A new control strategy that improves the stability of a voltage source converter (VSC) using the internal model design concept is discussed. Conclusions show that the proposed control system can positively influence the overall dynamic response and offers better controllability despite unexpected system variations, compared to a classical decoupled control system.",

This paper discusses a SPICE-based simulation model for the 1200-V, 45-mOmega CoolSiCTM SiC MOSFET that is both accurate and, owing to its compact structure, fast and robust in convergence. This enables, besides traditional double-pulse, also multi-pulse simulations of entire power circuits at the system level. A thorough comparison between simulation and measurement data shows a very good agreement over a wide range of parameter variations in both static and dynamic behavior.",

By comparing the sequence metrics of M observation sequences to a 'no signal'- hypothesis the one which first crosses a termination threshold is selected. This amounts to a variable length test that adapts itself to an unknown SNR in contrast to a fixed length test. In this work we demonstrate that the average test length can be further reduced by eliminating stochastical paths (=competitors) already during the competition if these have become highly unlikely to be selected. In addition we investigate how the termination and elimination thresholds should be set in order to fulfill a given performance constraint defined as an average fraction of the maximum achievable rate.",

The optimal power flow (OPF) of the traditional AC grid can determine the safe and economic operation state of the grid. The existence of the nonlinear power flow equation makes OPF a nonlinear and non-convex optimization problem. In the AC and DC grids with power electronic transformer (PET), the operational constraints of PET further increase the non-convexity. This paper will focus on addressing the non-convexity of OPF in AC and DC grids. The objective function of OPF in AC and DC grids is to minimize the generation cost or the system losses. The constraints include node power balance constraints, voltage amplitude constraints, line capacity constraints, and operational constraints of PET. The convex relaxation technique is used to transform OPF into a semi-definite programming(SDP) problem, and the sufficient conditions for the zero relaxation gap are derived to obtain the global optimal solution. The simulation on the extended IEEE33 test system with PET proves that the global optimal solution can be obtained.",

The methods used in the data collection process are generally categorized by 3 main groups: 1- Manual 2-Half Manual 3-Auto. Statically coded data collectors (type 1 and type 2) are unable to collect healthy data in the long term and require continuous development and maintenance effort, as internet pages are dynamic and changes would happen frequently in their page designs. In this study, a data scraping application (type 3) which is not affected by structural changes in web pages was developed. This study aims to obtain data from images of web pages using Deep CNNs.",

IoT is a network of interconnected objects based on standard communication protocols. Today's wireless networks are characterized by a fixed spectrum assignment policy. In accordance with country policies and existing laws, wireless networks are configured to use the assigned frequency band. The limited available spectrum and inefficiency of spectrum utilization have created the paradigm of opportunistic spectrum idles in existing wireless networks. This new network paradigm has been called “x New Generation Networks (xG Networks)”, “Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)” and “Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN)”. The Internet of cognitive radio-based objects incorporates new methods in order to solve some problems such as spectrum usage, bandwidth and usage area of the objects using the internet, using the characteristics of cognitive radio networks. In this study, routing algorithms, which can be used for Cognitive Radio Based IoT objects, will be examined by considering channel switching cost, end to end delay cost, energy efficiency and bandwidth dependent cost.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) sets high service requirements for the fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) standard. Grant-free (GF) transmissions is considered a promising technique for reducing the latency in the uplink. To achieve efficient radio resources utilization, sharing of resources is required for sporadic uplink traffic. Repetitions based transmission schemes aims to enhance the reliability of GF transmissions. However, repetitions may also generate excessive interference and cause additional queuing, harming the reliability and latency. In this work, we explore radio resource management (RRM) configurations for repetition based transmission schemes. That includes the number of repetitions, the allocation size per transmission (sub-band), sub-band hopping and uplink power control. Evaluations are conducted in a 5G NR compliant multi-user multi-cell simulation scenario with sporadic uplink GF URLLC transmissions. Our findings suggest that repetitions based schemes can, with a careful selection of the sub-band size and uplink power control parameters, achieve comparable URLLC performance with retransmission based schemes when the effect of queuing is disregarded.",

The similar idea has been explored before; however, the salient feature of our proposed scaling bit-progressive method is we have further taken into account the use and training of weight scaling factor, which can significant improve the inference accuracy. Our experimental results show that our trained Resnet- 18 neural network can improve the top-1 and top-5 accuracies of Tiny-ImageNet dataset by the average of 11.02% and 9.21% compared with the previous work without using the scaling factor. The top-1 and top-5 accuracy losses compared with float-point weights are only about 0.5% and 0.31% under the truncated size of 5-bit. The proposed method can be applied for neural network accelerators especially for those which support bit-serial processing.",

Deep learning facilitates hierarchicical feature extraction automatically. However the optimization of deep nets and validation of extracted features is critical in neuroimage processing. In multiple sclerosis, detection of the lesion is quite important for diagnosis, treatment, and follow up. Changes in brain morphology and white matter lesions are most significant findings in MS, where this diagnose and follow up is done nowadays by experts in the field subjectively. In this study, 40 MS patients scanned twice with an interval of 6 months, earning 80 MR images, which are grouped into 2 and tagged as having an MS lesion or not, and examined through test images based on three different convolutional neural networks, and classification results and success rate are reported.",

        "abstract": "The model of modular multilevel converter (MMC) has attracted extensive research efforts in the last few years to analyze stability or to design controllers. Multi-dq frames and harmonic state space (HSS) are two major modeling methods to address the time-variance of MMC caused by the complex internal frequency coupling. However, no details are presented on essential relation of these two methods. In this paper, the mathematical essence and equivalence of the MMC model in multi-dq frames and in HSS are revealed by using Fourier series. On this basis, the transformation matrix connecting two types of models is developed, which increases flexibility in MMC modeling process. Finally, correctness of the theory and transformation matrix are verified by experimental and simulation results.",

        "abstract": "In more and more countries conventional power plants based on fossil fuels are being substituted gradually by renewable energy sources (RES) like wind turbines, photovoltaics, biogas power plants etc., which affects the other both sectors. Because of varying weather conditions, the feed-in of RES shifts temporally as well as geographically and makes a secure system operation more difficult. A second important aspect is that a significant number of those RES are predominantly connected to the distribution grid levels. The ratio of feed-in to load is very different in distribution systems so that the balancing usually takes place via the transmission grid. However, the increase in bottlenecks in the transmission grids is hindering the balancing. Frequent shutdowns of RES units are the result. This contribution represents a new approach to power balancing at the same voltage level. The objective is to integrate several point-to-point direct current (DC) couplings into the distribution system operation so that additional power transits between high-feed and high-load network groups are possible. The concept is shown in Figure 1. The DC links can be executed as DC-lines or as Back-2-Back converters, which is not further distinguished in this contribution.",

The increase of the dynamic on-state resistance in normally-off GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) related to charge trapping and hot electron injection directly affects conduction losses and reduces the achievable benefit of GaN devices in power electronics. This paper demonstrates that the extend of dynamic Ron-increase significantly depends on the operation conditions and exemplarily shows recent improvements of commercially available devices.",

        "abstract": "Investigating frequency issues of voltage source inverters (VSIs) integrating into weak grid, a quasi-virtual synchronous generator (VSG) droop controller is proposed in this paper. The review of traditional active power droop control and VSG given in the paper reveals drawbacks of these methodologies, especially with respect to microgrid application. Motivated by the limitations, the proposed controller is designed to be capable of providing virtual inertia in support of frequency response, buffering frequency violations upon disturbances and synchronising to the grid without engagement of phase locked loop. Furthermore, considering about system strength, as this has been a critical barrier preventing renewable energy from further penetration, characteristics of weak grid are analysed as preliminary in this paper. And then criterion of the controller connecting to weak grid will be introduced based multi-input multiple-output (MIMO) Nyquist theorem. Complex transfer functions for the proposed controller are developed to understand frequency-coupling issues in inverter-weak grid integrated system, which will reinforce feasibility of the controller in frequency domain. A single machine infinite bus (SMIB) model built in PSCAD/EMTDC software is adopted as a specific case to validate the control strategy in time domain.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we study the uplink (UL) of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN), under the consideration of information privacy. In particular, we consider a system where the UL communication takes place with the presence of idle users (IUs), which act as the undesired information receivers. Moreover, the central processing unit (CU) utilizes remote radio units (RU)s belonging to the same operator, i.e., the trusted RUs, as well as the RUs belonging to other operators or private owners, i.e., the untrusted RUs. In order to preserve information privacy, we propose a coordinated jamming strategy, where the trusted RUs are enabled with full-duplex (FD) capability and transmit a coordinated jamming signal towards the exotic RUs and the IUs, while receiving and forwarding UL signal to the CU. An optimization problem is then formulated to maximize the sum uplink private information rate by jointly designing the fronthaul compression, as well as the information and jamming transmission strategies. Due to the intractability of the resulting mathematical problem, an iterative solution is proposed with convergence to a point satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. Numerical simulations illustrate a notable gain obtained via the proposed sharing mechanism under the consideration of information privacy.",

Computers provide convenience in many areas of our lives. They can make automaticaly people's jobs done more easily and quickly. In addition to the development of computers, people have begun to store the information. They have accessed through the developing techonology. They are available for various databases to store information. Information must be stored in a categorized form to access easily was stored text in databases. At first people were doing the categorization manually. But nowadays, this process is made automatically through machine learning algorithms which are being developed and widely used today. In this study, eight of machine learning classification algorithms were studied on 5200 documents which were previously labelled. The accuracy, recall, precision and F-measure values of the algorithms on the data are compared. According to the test results, GradientBoostigClassifier algorithm has the most successful result.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, grid simulator based on two-level inverter is widely used in the grid integration testing for renewable energy system and motor driver. However, the traditional control strategy is difficult to achieve higher output voltage quality. This paper proposes a finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) based strategy for grid simulator. Compared with the traditional control strategy which is based on the linear control algorithm, the proposed algorithm eliminates the process of rotation coordinate transformation and avoids the coupling conditions in the current control loop. With the analysis of LC filter, the current prediction equations are obtained, and the cost function is also designed. Simulation test on a two-level grid simulator is carried out with the output voltage reference containing power quality disturbances like harmonics, voltage sag and voltage swell. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can improve the voltage response speed and simplify the process of parameter adjustment, and it has good application foreground in the grid simulator for the test of renewable energy system and motor driver.",

        "abstract": "Real-time systems with hard timing constrains require known upper bounds on each task's worst-case execution time (WCET) to determine if all deadlines can be met. One challenge in predictable execution is that Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) cells must be refreshed periodically to maintain data validity, yet memory remains blocked during refresh, which results in overly pessimistic WCET bounds. This work contributes \"Colored Refresh\" to hide DRAM refresh overhead while preserving real-time schedulability for cyclic executives, which are widely used in highly critical systems. Colored Refresh partitions DRAM memory at rank granularity such that refreshes rotate round-robin from rank to rank. Real-time tasks are assigned different ranks via colored memory allocation. By cooperatively scheduling real-time tasks and refresh operations, memory requests no longer suffer from refresh interference. This reduces memory access latencies for tasks irrespective of DRAM density and size. Hence, Colored Refresh reduces a task's WCET and makes its execution more predictable.",

A good material utilization is achieved by the segmentation of the rotor and stator of an electrical machine. The magnetic field calculation needs an accurate material model to consider the segmentation and anisotropic magnetic material behaviour. The basis of the model in this study are measurements of magnetic material anisotropy in a rotational single sheet tester. Finally, the model is applied to a finite element simulation of a segmented synchronous machine.",

        "abstract": "Code-switching is the alternation of two or more languages in a single utterance or a conversation and is prevalent in multilingual communities all over the world. Spoken Term Detection (STD) is the task of detecting a given word or phrase in audio. STD has applications in audio indexing and mining. In this work, we explore Spoken Term Detection for code-switched conversational Hindi-English speech. Code-switching provides various challenges to this problem, including, 1. lack of training data to build robust code-switched Automatic Speech Recog- nition (ASR) systems, 2. non-standardized transcription due to borrowing and cross-transcription, 3. presence of translated or code-switched variants of the terms. In this work, we assume that a code-switched ASR System for Hindi-English does not exist, and make use of only a monolingual Hindi ASR to retrieve audio containing Hindi and English keywords. We use various techniques to normalize the output of a monolingual ASR system. We evaluate our techniques using Term Weighted Value (TWV) and find that phonetic matching of the query and ASR hypotheses at the utterance level is the most promising approach.",

We also numerically presented that an InP-organic hybrid optical modulator shows clear eye opening at 100 Gbps NRZ owing to 10 dBm improvement in optical modulation amplitude.",

        "abstract": "The heterogeneous distribution of user's mobility and traffic profiles in mobile networks leads to challenges handling localized network congestions and radio links failures (RLF). Mobility Load Balancing (MLB) and Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) are two Self-Organizing Network (SON) use-cases designed to gain network's controllability for these challenges. In this paper we propose a scheme to control some parameters related to the A3 trigger event for handover management in order to deploy MLB and MRO independently. MLB modifies the Cell Individual Offsets (CIO) and is able to transfer the excess load from the overloaded eNodeBs to the less congested neighboring eNodeBs, whereas MRO adjusts the A3 event handover parameters - Hysteresis and Time to Trigger (TTT), autonomously based on the mobility of the UEs and reduces the Radio Link Failures due to too early or too late handovers. Simulations for MRO and MLB are conducted on NS-3 simulator and they are evaluated with optimized values of the handover parameters for different ranges of UE mobility speeds and load scenarios. The results show that MLB balances the cell traffic with the optimal configuration of CIO values and MRO improves the success rate of handovers with the optimal set of hysteresis and TTT selection based on UE mobility.",

The proposed control strategy can continuously update the network's parameters based on the gradient descent method, according to the operation information of ADN and then directly get the optimal strategy with high return value. The goal of return function is to minimize the total node-voltage deviation, line loss of distribution network, the regulation of microgrid (MG) and the power fluctuation of tie-line. The optimization model can improve the operation performance of the ADN and reduce the impact on MGs. Finally, the effectiveness of the real-time optimization of ADN based on DDPG is proved by an improved IEEE 13-node case-study.",

        "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) is one of the promising solutions to enable augment reality (AR) by processing computational-intensive tasks within short latency constraint. However, the quality of user experience of MEC-enabled AR will significantly degrade in mobile scenarios, as it is difficult to obtain accurate channel state information (CSI) to make optimal offloading decision. In this paper, we propose an online offloading algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization to dynamically optimize the selections of the transmission rate and edge server without prior CSI. The algorithm makes a tradeoff between the reliability and latency in the MEC-enabled AR system. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the scheme with outdated CSI and is particularly applicable to the mobile scenarios for AR applications.",

It is developed by properly applying the non-redundant sampling representations of electromagnetic fields to the voltage acquired by a non-directive probe and assuming, as required by the image principle, the considered AUT and its image as contained in a prolate spheroid. Once the non-redundant NF data over the lower hemisphere have been properly synthesized from the voltage samples acquired on the upper one, an efficient 2-D optimal sampling interpolation scheme is then used to reconstruct the NF data required by the standard spherical NF/FF transformation. Numerical simulations, assessing the accuracy of the developed non-redundant spherical NF/FF transformation, are shown.",

The proposed MDLL-based digital CDR uses 2x-oversampling technique to lower the bit error rate (BER) and achieves fast lock time using an initial tracking mode. A multi-phase MDLL is utilized to provide the 8- phase reference clocks needed for the PI-based CDR, thereby achieving the power reduction effect. A near-ground signaling (NGS) receiver with a passive CTLE is used for lower power operation at 20 Gbps/channel. The proposed 20 Gbps CDR with receiver equalization is implemented in a 40nm CMOS process, achieving a power consumption of only 25.0 mW (=1.25 mW/Gb/s).",

        "abstract": "We propose a semi-automatic progressive enhancement method for latent fingerprints. This method requires three inputs; a latent image, a manual segmentation, and an initial block location. The method starts enhancing the initial block using a matched filter in the frequency domain, then the enhanced block is padded back on the input latent image. The padded image is fed back as an input image and the surrounding blocks of the enhanced block are progressively enhanced. The proposed method performs iterative enhancement and feedback until the enhanced blocks fill the entire segmentation. The proposed method is benchmarked against several state-of-the-art methods with the NIST SD27 database. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of identification accuracy.",

And the multi-terminal hybrid UHVDC system which can provide a larger capacity, more economical and more flexible transmission mode, is a development trend of HVDC technology. The system proposed in this paper adopts VSC converters with the characteristics of DC fault self-clearing and high speed switch (HSS). The DC line protection scheme of multi-terminal hybrid UHVDC system is investigated. First, the configuration scheme of DC line protection and and coordination strategy are proposed. Then, aiming at the key problem of line fault isolation in this multi-terminal system, the fault line selection method is proposed. Finally, based on PSCAD/EMTDC simulation, the feasibility of the proposed fault line selection method is verified.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a 3D model of Partial Discharge (PD) phenomena, based on Finite Integration Technique (FIT), using the CST STUDIO¯ software. PD modeling is useful to study discharge event phenomena and to analyse the critical parameters that characterize its behaviour. The knowledge of PD phenomena inside electrical insulation is an important issue to assess the insulation condition and its degradation state, obtaining information about its defect types and the possible risk of failure that can occur. PD models based on numerical methods have the advantage to give an insight into the discharge events, to describe non-uniform E-field distributions inside the material and the charge distribution on the surface of the defects and on the electrodes. In this paper, a model of PD event inside an air disk inclusion within epoxy-resin dielectric of cables for distribution and transmission networks is presented. The E-field distribution is calculated in relation to two different positions of the defect inside the dielectric and the displacement current density on the electrodes is evaluated together with the conduction current density inside the void. The proposed study is the first step of a work in progress that aims to describe the propagation of PD signals in distribution and transmission networks.",
