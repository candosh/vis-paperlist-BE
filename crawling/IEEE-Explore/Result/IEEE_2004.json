Our system is a single-chip solution based on a special CMOS pixel structure that can extract phase information from the received light pulses. The sensor chip integrates a 64x64 pixel array with a high-speed clock generator and ADC. A unique advantage of the chip is that it can be manufactured with an ordinary CMOS process. Compared with other types of depth sensors reported in the literature, our solution offers significant advantages, including superior accuracy, high frame rate, cost effectiveness and a drastic reduction in processing required to construct the depth maps. We explain the factors that determine the resolution of our system, discuss various problems that a time-of-flight depth sensor might face, and propose practical solutions."

Statistical background-subtraction is first used to identify local regions-of-interest. Within each region, gradient information in the foreground and background are combined to form a contour saliency map. After thinning, an A* path-constrained search along watershed boundaries is used to complete any broken contour segments. Lastly, the contour image is flood-filled to produce silhouettes. Results are presented that demonstrate the robustness of the approach to detect people across a wide range of thermal imagery using a fixed set of parameters."

The height of a camera was set up so that people's head might be photoed by the vertical central part of images. In infrared images pedestrians belong to the upper range in the grey-level. Therefore, detects the core (especially face) of a head using the P-tile method. In this approach detects the head area candidate using binarization variable threshold in the search region around core, lowering a threshold. And it makes the search area for detection body and legs. Search area makes below head area candidate. And this method tracks pedestrian after first order prediction. First order prediction uses center of gravity each region and time series."

An equally correct statement is that we present a tree-growing method whose performance can be analysed in the framework of Adaboost. We argue that Adaboost can be improved by presenting the input to a sequence of weak classifiers, each one tuned to the conditional probability determined by the output of previous weak classifiers. As a result, the final classifier has a tree structure, rather than being linear, thus the name \"Adatree\". One of the consequences of the tree structure is that different input data may have different processing time. Early experimentation shows a reduced computation cost with respect to Adaboost. One of our intended applications is real-time detection, where cascades of boosted detectors have recently become successful. The reduced computation cost of the proposed method shows some potential for being used directly in detection problems, without need of a cascade."

Assuming a perfectly diversified bad before the price response, we show that TCA setpoint changes in response to the market price will result in a redistribution of TCAs in on/off states and therefore change the probabilities for a unit to reside in each state. A randomly distributed load can be partially synchronized and the aggregated diversity lost. The loss of the load diversity can then create unexpected dynamics in the aggregated load profile. Raising issues such as restoring load diversity and damping the peak loads are also addressed in the paper."

        "abstract": "Segmenting image sequences into meaningful layers is fundamental to many applications such as surveillance, tracking, and video summarization. Background subtraction techniques are popular for their simplicity and, while they provide a dense (pixelwise) estimate of foreground/background, they typically ignore image motion which can provide a rich source of information about scene structure. Conversely, layered motion estimation techniques typically ignore the temporal persistence of image appearance and provide parametric (rather than dense) estimates of optical flow. Recent work adaptively combines motion and appearance estimation in a mixture model framework to achieve robust tracking. Here we extend mixture model approaches to cope with dense motion and appearance estimation. We develop a unified Bayesian framework to simultaneously estimate the appearance of multiple image layers and their corresponding dense flow fields from image sequences. Both the motion and appearance models adapt over time and the probabilistic formulation can be used to provideasegmentation of thescene into foreground/background regions. This extension of mixture models includes prior probability models for the spatial and temporal coherence of motion and appearance. Experimental results show that the simultaneous estimation of appearance models and flow fields in multiple layers improves the estimation of optical flow at motion boundaries."

Amongst the several performance criteria considered for optimal network reconfiguration, maximizing loadability is an important one. Owing to the discrete nature of the solution space, a fuzzy adaptation of the evolutionary programming algorithm for optimal reconfiguration of RDS to maximize loadability is proposed in this paper. This method maximizes a fuzzy index developed using a maximum loadability index. A 33-bus RDS is optimally reconfigured by the proposed method and the results are presented."

The model was obtained via frequency domain measurements and rational approximation of the terminal admittance matrix Y. In the case of transformers with ungrounded windings, the model may produce erroneous results due to a near singular condition at low frequencies. This work shows that the problem can be overcome by explicit measurement and modeling of the zero sequence system. Blocks of Y which correspond to ungrounded windings are modified by removal of their zero sequence components. A new zero sequence system is obtained by dedicated measurements and the two functions are approximated with rational functions which are combined to produce the final model. Application to a wye-delta connected transformer demonstrates the validity of the approach."

The setup is demonstrated to give a consistent data set where the effect of the measurement cables can be eliminated. The accuracy of the data set is increased by using a combination of current measurements and voltage transfer measurements. A rational approximation of the admittance matrix is calculated in the frequency domain in the range 50 Hz-1 MHz and subjected to passivity enforcement, giving a stable model which can be included in EMTP-type simulation programs.

        "abstract": "Automatic image orientation detection for natural images is a useful, yet challenging research area. Humans use scene context and semantic object recognition to identify the correct image orientation. However, it is difficult for a computer to perform the task in the same way because current object recognition algorithms are extremely limited in their scope and robustness. As a result, existing orientation detection methods were built upon low-level vision features such as spatial distributions of color and texture. In addition, discrepant detection rates have been reported. We have developed a probabilistic approach to image orientation detection via confidence-based integration of low-level and semantic cues within a Bayesian framework. Our current accuracy is approaching 90% for unconstrained consumer photos, impressive given the findings of a psychophysical study conducted recently. The proposed framework is an attempt to bridge the gap between computer and human vision systems, and is applicable to other problems involving semantic scene content understanding."

Rechargeable batteries such as Redox flow, which are not aged by frequent charging and discharging, have a quick response equivalent to SMES and outstanding function during overload. The battery efficiency increases when the cycle period of charging/discharging becomes shorter. In addition to leveling load, the battery is advantageous for secondary control in the power system and maintenance of power quality of distributed power resources. In this paper, we study the control performance of RF battery systems in its application to LFC. Using dynamic simulation, we show that the LFC capacity of RF battery systems is ten times that of fossil power systems due to quick response characteristics."

We show that it is possible to assign physical meaning to DTSBN structures, such that root nodes model whole objects, while parent-child connections encode component-subcomponent relationships. Therefore, within the DTSBN framework, the treatment and recognition of object parts requires no additional training, but merely a particular interpretation of the tree/subtree structure. As such, DTSBNs naturally allow for multi-stage object recognition, in which initial recognition of object parts induces recognition of objects as a whole. As our reported experiments show, this explicit, multi-stage treatment of occlusion outperforms more traditional object-recognition approaches, which typically fail to account for occlusion in any principled or unified manner."

By reducing peak demand, a utility can avoid paying high prices when purchasing power or it may sell excess generation at high prices. By minimizing system losses, savings are obtained through reduced demand and energy charges. Besides a positive economic response, load reduction associated with improved power factor at the substation has a beneficial effect on voltage stability by increasing the system stability limit margin."

In applications involving image collections, however, images are clustered sequentially, allowing surrounding images to be used as temporal context. We present a general probabilistic temporal context model in which the first-order Markov property is used to integrate content-based and temporal context cues. The model uses elapsed time-dependent transition probabilities between images to enforce the fact that images captured within a shorter period of time are more likely to be related. This model is generalized in that it allows arbitrary elapsed time between images, making it suitable for classifying image collections. We also derived a variant of this model to use in image collections for which no timestamp information is available, such as film scans. We applied the context models to two problems, achieving significant gains in accuracy in both cases. The two algorithms used to implement inference within the context model, Viterbi and belief propagation, yielded similar results."

Desired test responses are calculated in the frequency domain using an admittance representation of the line and its terminal conditions. Time domain step responses are calculated using the inverse Fourier transform, with semi-analytic integration between sample points to permit calculation at arbitrarily large time values. The required number of frequency samples is greatly reduced by adaptively calculating the samples while considering the frequency domain behavior of the integrand. Responses from arbitrary excitations are calculated by superposition of weighted, time delayed step responses. The accuracy of the approach is validated for an overhead line and a cable system by comparison with responses obtained by a phase domain line model."

This presentation discusses a proposal originally developed in 2001 by Chauncey Starr, founder and emeritus president of EPRI, for the creation of a \"Continental SuperGrid\" to meet the nation's energy needs in the mid to later half of the 21/sup st/ Century. In brief, the proposal calls for the creation of an Energy SuperGrid, delivering both electricity and hydrogen. The electric portion of the grid would use superconducting, low voltage, high current DC cables for power transmission, with liquid hydrogen used as the cryogen agent. The electric power and hydrogen would be supplied from nuclear and other source power plants spaced along the grid. Electricity would exit the system at various taps, connecting into the existing AC power grid. The hydrogen would also exit the grid, providing a readily available, alternative fuel, for perhaps fuel-cell based automobiles, or be retained as storage of electric power."

        "abstract": "Monitoring the switching times of circuit breakers is important in the condition assessment of the operating mechanism. Although methods exist for this, they are not applicable to existing plant without retrofitting. Recent research shows that arcing produces impulsive radio frequency radiation. Using direct digital sampling of the antenna signals, impulses from operating circuit breakers may be recorded. From timing analysis of the received impulses, the interpole switching time of the circuit breaker can be measured. Results of this method are shown for a field trial on a 132 kV SF6 circuit breaker attached to a capacitor bank. The relationship between the opening and closing impulses is discussed. This method of timing measurement can be applied to energised plant. Measurement of the interpole switching times is completely non-invasive, whereas the overall switching time requires a clamp CT fitted on the CB wiring."

Often, a student can develop his/her own learning style by the process of metacognition. Ideas are borrowed from these concepts for use in a first-level power systems course. It is beyond a doubt that both cognitive and metacognitive skills are necessary for students to succeed in any course. While a semester-long power systems course leaves little time for critical thinking and passive reflection for students, certain activities may very well serve for some of these learning processes."

Although area-based matching and similarity interpolation for sub-pixel displacement estimation are commonly used in many areas as a fundamental procedure, they are bound to simple translation. The proposed method is based on a practical similarity model in N-dimensional parameter space. Using similarity measures obtained at discrete positions in the parameter space, our method provides a highly accurate maximum position of similarity in sub-sampling resolution; that position corresponds to image deformation parameters. Experimental results using both synthetic and real images demonstrate that our method can estimate parameters more accurately than previous methods."

This control action does not imply changes in the generation and load asset defined by day-ahead market laws. The representation of UPFC devices in a power system is given through a nonlinear model. The UPFC model includes electrical equivalent circuits, a local control scheme and a centralized control scheme. Control actions are evaluated through a nonlinear optimization process. The approach is tested on a detailed representation of the Italian national grid and test results are presented."

In addition, the performance of the generator excitation system and the prime mover controls are important during a system disturbance. Coordination between these systems and system protection as well as control strategies are needed to avoid system collapse. This talk discusses these key issues and their relation to the blackout."

Several markets for this ancillary service have been tried without changing the control design, but a bilateral market (e.g. for self-service) requires the redesign of the controls. Similarly, the development of a market for voltage control requires new control design. In the case of stability limited systems, some new controllers like special protection schemes (SPS) can help operation that is closer to the limits of the system. In this presentation, we present new ideas on slow real time controls by the control center that can provide frequency and voltage control under market conditions. Also, faster controls utilizing SPS or RAS that can provide better stability control is described."

Some features of virtual instrumentation are shown with real-time phasor diagrams, sequence component analysis, and spectral analysis of AC data. We describe the general design of a single lab setup, which can be used for power electronics and electromechanical energy conversion experiments independently. We also present an example of power system operations, which can be implemented by the interconnection of several lab stations."

In this paper, it has been demonstrated that, pre-processing the data with fuzzy-genetic algorithm at the RTU, will reduce the uncertainty and vagueness in the measurands. The initial population for genetic algorithm applied is generated with assumed fuzzy functions. These functions are optimized using the theory of reproduction, cross over and mutation. The result shows that fuzzy-genetic algorithm gives better results than the other methods available. It is also observed that fuzzy-genetic algorithm is easy to apply to the output fuzzy solution rather than to the input fuzzy function."

This approach applies to any AC electric motors, regardless of winding type, single-phase or three-phase, regular or nonregular, integral-slot or fractional-slot, symmetrical or asymmetrical. Since this novel approach substitutes the approximation method adopted by conventional approaches with an exact one, it distinguishes itself by offering precise results, general applicability, and fast calculation."

As Hurricane Juan's winds began to die down, Nova Scotia Power began the restoration effort. Crews fanned out along the path of the Hurricane to assess the damage and provide the information from which plans could be developed to remove trees, eliminate safety hazards and restore power. Beginning early Monday morning, our first priorities were working with emergency measures organization and the municipalities to address public safety hazards and to restore power to critical customers like hospitals who were relying on backup generators for power supply. Within five days of the Hurricane, 95 percent of those who lost power had service restored."

DialogPlus is one of four international projects, supported in the US by the NSF International Collaborative Research Program in Digital Libraries, and in the UK by the Joint Information Systems Committee of the UK Higher Education Funding Councils. The two primary objectives of the project are to develop: a distributed enabling information infrastructure for the support of learning and teaching in geography; innovative approaches to teaching and learning, based on this infrastructure. Specifically, the project the undergraduate and postgraduate programs of study in geography in the consortium universities can be enriched and developed through cross-national collaboration and online delivery; different virtual learning environments can be supported by a common, open and distributed digital library infrastructure; major geospatial resources relevant for the study of the environment and landscape and for the study of human populations in cities and the countryside can be used in student programs of study; important skills in the analysis of spatial information through use of Geographical Information Science and Earth Observation software and functions can be taught online and made available in undergraduate programs."
