Previous designs of HVDC breaker were either too slow to be suitable for interrupting fast-rising fault currents or had conduction losses too high for economically viable operation on a grid. However, the new class of \"hybrid\" DC circuit breakers has fundamentally changed this position, with the potential of interrupting fault currents in a few milliseconds with negligible steady-state power losses. As part of the EU-funded \"Twenties\" project, Alstom Grid has built and tested a 120kV prototype DC breaker. The design of the breaker and the results obtained during testing are described in the paper."

To meet the challenges, we fuse point and line features to form a robust odometry algorithm. Line features are abundant indoors and less sensitive to lighting change than points. We extract 3D points and lines from RGB-D data, analyze their measurement uncertainties, and compute camera motion using maximum likelihood estimation. We prove that fusing points and lines produces smaller motion estimate uncertainty than using either feature type alone. In experiments we compare our method with state-of-the-art methods including a keypoint-based approach and a dense visual odometry algorithm. Our method outperforms the counterparts under both constant and varying lighting conditions. Specifically, our method achieves an average translational error that is 34.9% smaller than the counterparts, when tested using public datasets."

There is a term starting to be used of “soft open-point” which can provide controlled power transfer between two 11kV or 33kV distribution groups, without affecting short-circuit levels, voltage differences, loop flows or limitations due to phase-angle differences. The 4-quadrant converters can provide reactive power support and voltage control at each end of the link and multi-terminal is also feasible. There are future technology opportunities including enhancement of existing corridors through the conversion of existing AC lines to DC. This paper provides a technology overview as well as information on recently deployed projects ranging from linking of oil and gas platforms, through to an urban infeed. It will summarise the benefits of MVDC and the applications where it may provide a competitive or preferential alternative solution to conventional technology."

By introducing an impedance-conditioning term in the voltage used by the PLL, the VSC control system is virtually synchronized to the voltage at a stronger point in the grid. By synchronization to the voltage behind the corresponding virtual impedance, the proposed approach can be utilized to influence the reactive power flow of the VSC in a way that will inherently enhance the power transfer capability of the high-impedance grid. To verify the impact of the proposed approach, an analytical model of a VSC HVDC terminal is used to calculate the achievable steady-state power transfer capability, as well as the range where small-signal stability is ensured, in a grid with low SCR when applying different levels of virtual impedance in the grid synchronization. The validity of the stability assessment based on the analytical model, and the increased stability range achieved with the proposed impedance-conditioned PLL, are also verified by time-domain simulations in the Matlab/Simulink environment."

Computational results demonstrate the value of the integrated approach and its ability to allocate network functions supporting end-to-end requests with limited physical resources."

We validate the methods by combining a large dataset of nearly 150,000 Google Street View images from Paris with a cadastre map to infer approximate construction date for each facade.

However, compared with the traditional Current-Sourced Converter (CSC) HVDC, VSC-HVDC is more vulnerable to DC faults due to the lower DC side impedances and more sensitive power electronics used in its construction. This paper investigates the equivalent two-level converter system response under a pole-to-pole fault. A three-terminal VSC-HVDC system is developed in PSCAD/EMTDC to evaluate the system fault response and to verify theoretical analysis. Based on the results, it is found that the AC grid will initially contribute relatively little to the DC fault current seen by the DC side circuit breakers during a pole-to-pole fault. The converter fault recovery strategy has also been studied in this paper. It is found that after successful operation of the hybrid DC circuit breaker, with the aid of bump-less transfer control, the DC system has a good voltage recovery response. The contribution of this paper is that it gives an improved understanding of the system response and offers some guidance for the design of DC protection systems."

This paper describes how the AAC can be optimised by modulating the converter terminal voltages with zero-phase sequence triplen harmonic components. The optimisation reduces the ratio of the number of the full-bridge cells compared to the simpler Director Switches which offers a valuable improvement in footprint and efficiency."

In this paper a calculation method of important parameters of the short-circuit current is presented. The DC short-circuit current is determined by the characteristics of the AC and DC system. The substantial influence factors are evaluated and based on the ratings of existing VSC-HVDC projects typical AC and DC impedances are derived. For different HVDC scenarios resulting short-circuit currents are calculated. The paper concludes with recommendations for the calculation of short-circuit currents in radial and meshed HVDC grids."

Then, the power transfer capability curves of a VSC connected to a weak grid of an SCR of 1.1 pu by means of an L-interface are calculated. Finally, the impact of providing additional reactive power (Q) support is investigated through utilising a capacitor at the connection point.

It relies on an integral control enforcing the frequency droop characteristics (of classical speed governors), in addition to the voltage-droop control of VSCs.

SPEN and University of Warwick, supported by Network Innovation Allowance funding in the UK, initialized a systematic study on the feasibility of an LFAC system. This paper summarises the initial design considerations. A system design for an LFAC connection is established and the key components discussed. The effect of lowering frequency upon transformer design is assessed by developing example designs for the both the wind farm and wind turbine transformer. The next stage of the study will be focused on optimisation of the components and system level simulations as well as cost benefit analysis to reveal the niche market of this technology."

Such large links may be required to provide ancillary services such as fast frequency response or emergency power re-routing in the event of a system disturbance. Providing such services may require converters to be designed with overload capacity. This paper examines how the thermal aspects of semiconductor devices may impact the operation of such converters and how the exploitation of short-term thermal dynamics may lead to dynamic overload rating."

The development of several new HVDC circuit breaker prototypes indicate that this step may be achieved in the years to come. In order to facilitate the installation of HVDC circuit breakers, appropriate standards and tests need to be developed. These tests and standards must ensure that the technology is capable of functioning as required. In cases where direct testing cannot be carried out, a synthetic test circuit is used to recreate the conditions of the power system. Voltage testing envelopes are used to define the specification of these synthetic test circuits for Alternating Current (AC) circuit breakers. A similar concept can be applied to fault currents in HVDC networks, allowing specifications for HVDC synthetics test circuits to be defined. Testing envelopes which encapsulate the fault currents are analytically shown in this paper and compared to detailed simulations of faults in a VSC HVDC system. Testing envelopes can be drawn for a range of converter topologies in point-to-point and multi-terminal applications. Taking into account the large power electronic elements in the recently developed HVDC circuit breakers, discussion is given to the definition the worst case fault for a HVDC protection system. This paper demonstrates that a terminal fault is not necessarily the worst fault scenario for HVDC circuit breaker."

This expected situation would lead to take into consideration new approaches in the last mile substations in order to mitigate the drawbacks of the conventional legacy and that by providing more functions in the last mile substations that could provide more flexibility and functionality regarding voltage level, reactive power (RP), amount of demand and losses [1]. This paper focuses the light on the consideration that are taken in designing a distribution transformer that provide additional abilities in regulating the voltage and controlling the RP that is injected in the distribution network (DN) by using a fractional rated converter that is attached partially with the windings of the transformer. This approach aims mainly to enhance the unit with more flexibility in controlling the flow the of the RP at the last mile of the network in order to decrease the losses that are caused by transmitting RP through long transmission networks. The design of the power electronics (PE) modules is detailed and its functionality in compensating Var power is discussed. This approach contributes in meeting the future expectations of the low voltage (LV) networks changes and loading, this contribution is comprised of providing the substation unit with fractional rated power electronic converter that is attached partially with the winding of the LV transformer to provide the load with a specific level of its demand from RP, whereby the solid state switches are controlled according to the immediate need for Var control and support in low voltage (LV) networks [1]."

In this paper, an automatic seeded region growing (SRG) algorithm for coloured images proposed by Y. Shih and S. Cheng is modified for segmentation of plant leaf diseases. The colour difference between adjacent regions is computed using Euclidean distance metric in the algorithm. This paper proposes a novel two dimensional look up table for labeling the neighbours for region merging. The look up table is created by traversing the image vertically and horizontally and any change in the labels of pixel is noted in the table. The incorporation of the table helps in better organization in region merging step and helps in further segmentation of the image. It must be noted that the performance of coloured image segmentation largely depends on the colour space chosen. The algorithm is first implemented in the YCbCr colour space and then implemented in other colour spaces like YCgCr, CIELAB and RGB to check for the best performance of the segmentation algorithm. Experimental results show that the SRG algorithm along with the proposed modification for region merging give good results in the YCbCr compared to other colour spaces for plant leaf disease segmentation."

However, writing an application for multiple accelerators remains today challenging because going from a single accelerator to multiple ones indeed requires to deal with potentially non-uniform domain decomposition, inter-accelerator data movements, and dynamic load balancing. Writing such code manually is time consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a new programming tool called STEPOCL along with a new domain specific language designed to simplify the development of an application for multiple accelerators. We evaluate both the performance and the usefulness of STEPOCL with three applications and show that: (i) the performance of an application written with STEPOCL scales linearly with the number of accelerators, (ii) the performance of an application written using STEPOCL competes with a handwritten version, (iii) larger workloads run on multiple devices that do not fit in the memory of a single device, (iv) thanks to STEPOCL, the number of lines of code required to write an application for multiple accelerators is roughly divided by ten."

Images have a large size which allows embedding secret messages of large size, so they are a good medium for digital steganography. The main goal of steganalysis is to detect the presence of hidden messages in digital media. In this paper, we propose a steganalysis method based on color feature correlation and machine learning classification. Fusing features with features obtained from color-rich models allows to increase the detect ability of hidden messages in the color images. Our novel proposition uses the correlation between different channels of color images. Features are extracted from the channel correlation and co-occurrence correlation. In this work, all stego images are created with a range of different payload sizes using two steganography S-UNIWARD and WOW algorithms. To validate the proposed method, his efficiency is demonstrated by comparison with color rich model steg analysis."

To support such simultaneous information and energy cooperation, we propose two transmission protocols, namely power splitting (PS) relaying protocol and the transmission mode adaptation (TMA) protocol for without/with the source-destination link, respectively. For both transmission protocols, joint resource allocation problems are formulated to maximize the system throughput. By using the Lagrange dual method, we develop efficient algorithms to find the optimal polices of the nonconvex optimization problems."

Small-signal analysis of the converter is presented, to assist in control scheme development for the converter input and output stages. A Lyapunov controller is embedded within the conventional output voltage sharing control loop. A master-slave control scheme is proposed to ensure power sharing under a range of operating conditions, and provides fault-tolerant operation since the status of `master' can be reallocated in the event that the present `master' module fails."

Next, we study how severity changes and quantify differences between classes in terms of bug-fixing attributes. Then, we focus on topic differences: using LDA, we extract topics associated with each severity class, and study how these topics differ across classes, platforms, and over time. Our findings include: severity and priority affect bug fixing time; medium-severity contributors are more experienced than high-severity contributors; and there have been more concurrency and cloud-related high-severity bugs on desktop since 2009, while on Android concurrency bugs are prevalent."

This includes techniques for fault detection and location, and dc-breakers for faults clearing. The characteristics and consequences of dc-side faults are very different compared to ac-system faults, and conventional ac-protection methods are not necessarily suited in HVDC grids. This paper presents a study on fault detection in radial offshore HVDC grids, with emphasis on the identification of suitable fault detection criteria based on local measurements, referred to as markers. For selection of the best suited marker, four different requirements have been applied; dependability, speed, security and selectivity. This implies that all relevant dc-faults must be detected as fast as possible, and no other transient events should be detected as faults. In addition it must be possible to identify the faulted section/cable for all relevant faults based on local measurements, to allow for selective disconnection. The work is based on simulations of a radial three-terminal VSC HVDC system in PSCAD."

Our approach has two phases. The first phase is to construct finite state machines (FSM) for gesture recognition. We present a novel approach - which leverages techniques from functional programming languages - to define rich yet compact FSM. Such FSM can be further tuned for higher accuracy with help of some training data and a suitable optimization method - this is the second phase. To demonstrate effectiveness, we created a gesture recognition system for an automotive scenario as an Android Smart watch app and then tuned the gesture recognition engine using Cultural Algorithms optimization and training data. We achieved 77% gesture recognition accuracy which is on par which more computationally intensive techniques such as Hidden Markov Models."

Further, the paper presents a framework for modelling the closed-loop system such that controller and network systems can be designed. The paper also provides an LMI-based algorithm for computing optimal controller and network systems that achieve a stable closed-loop system while meeting performance measures. The deigned systems have a fixed structure and hence the associated design complexity is reduced.

        "abstract": "With the increased levels of offshore wind power penetration into power systems, the impact of offshore wind power on stability of power systems require more investigation. In this paper, the effects of a large scale doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based offshore wind farm (OWF) on power system stability are examined. The OWF is connected to the main onshore grid through a voltage source converter (VSC) based high voltage direct current (HVDC) link. A large scale DFIG based OWF is connected to the New England 10-machine 39-bus test system through a VSC-HVDC. One of the synchronous generators in the test system is replaced by an OWF with an equivalent generated power. As the voltage source converter can control the active and reactive power independently, the use of the onshore side converter to control its terminal voltage is investigated. The behaviour of the test system is evaluated under both small and large grid disturbances in both cases with and without the offshore wind farm."

We propose to model each dataset by a compact Gaussian mixture which is designed for the specific purpose of colour transfer between images which have different scene content. A non rigid transformation is estimated by minimising the Euclidean distance (L2) between these two distributions and the estimated transformation is used for transfering colour statistics from one image to another. Experimental results show that this is a very promising approach for transferring colour and it performs very well against an alternative reference approach. "

The reduced order model can preserve the unstable characteristic of the VSC system and provide an explicit mathematical expression for the system eigenvalues. This analytical formula can directly reveal by simple inspection relationships between the system stability and system parameters. Results show that small signal stability of the system is significantly affected by the ac system strength (SCR) and the Phased Locked Loop (PLL) parameters. Also, small signal stability is more sensitive to the ac voltage controller's gain than to the power controller gains. Compared with the previous developed full order model, the reduced order model can give more insights and constructive suggestions how to adjust the parameters of the control system of VSC. In particular, it is shown that by increasing the value of the voltage controller's integral gain the system can be made to operate at an SCR which is very close to the theoretical minimum SCR limit."

Performance of HVDC systems has significantly improved with the emergence of voltage source converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC). Increased controllability provides independent control of active and reactive power which facilitates controlling of voltage and frequency. This paper investigates the frequency control capability of VSC-HVDC to determine the improvement extent that VSC HVDC systems provide for the frequency recovery and system inertia. Two frequency control strategies using dc voltage and active power outer loops are investigated. The analysis is carried out using a time domain simulator, where the tie line in the Kundur test system is replaced by VSC-HVDC. Simulation results have shown that frequency control capability of VSC-HVDC dramatically improves the frequency performance, especially in isolated power systems."

In this paper, we show that the massive use of network coding throughout the network significantly improves latency and reduces the frequency of packet re-transmission. Thus, an architecture built around network coding may be a feasible road towards realizing the tactile internet vision. Our contribution is threefold: (i) we show how network coding improves latency and reduces packet re-transmission with respect to other coding schemes analytically, (ii) we present our implementation of a network coding capable software router and support our analytical results with realistic measurements, and (iii) we show that, in contrast with current packet-switched networks, network coding can be seamlessly integrated in Software Defined Networks (SDN) using our software router as a Virtual Network Function. Such combination of network coding and SDN summons a codecentric networking architecture that can be a promising host to future 5G systems."

VSC-HVDC is more suitable for creating offshore grids. Despite this fact, many LCC transmission systems are in operation across the sea interconnecting mainlands or islands. This work addresses the concept of connecting wind power plants in series with an LCC-HVDC transmission link already built by means of a self-commutating Current Source Converter (CSC). The idea is similar to series tapping stations which can extract power form the HVDC link. Nevertheless, a CSC can act as a rectifier or inverter, so power reversal is available and has the same advantages of a VSC. The coupling between LCC stations and the CSC is straightforward since both topologies are current source converters. The control and operation of the system under normal conditions is presented and verified by means of simulations using MATLAB Simulink."

With only a single transistor, the converter is able to efficiently perform three tasks simultaneously, namely, maximum power point tracking (MPPT), battery charging and driving the pump at constant flow rate. The conduction and switching losses of each individual components of the converter and the inductor core loss are calculated and analyzed when the two inductors operate in different modes. The analysis shows that the output stage inductor and power diode are the major contributors to the total power loss. A 14W laboratory prototype converter is built and the experimental results are compared with the model analysis."

The analytical ac-side small-signal impedance model of a three-phase MMC is first developed in this paper. The analytical impedance model is verified by means of injecting a small perturbation voltage/current signal in a nonlinear time-domain simulation model. The impacts of the controller parameters on the stability of the interconnected system are then examined by using frequency-domain analysis approach, which can offer guidance for controller parameters design. Finally, the time-domain simulation results validate the theoretical analysis."

        "abstract": "Earlier work on calculating maximum power curves (MPCs) and maximum available power (MAPs) for VSC converters was not consistent with the way it is done for LCC converters. This paper attempts to use an approach consistent with LCCs by using a Thévenin voltage that is calculated to give 1.0 pu terminal voltage at rated power and unity power factor for the VSC. The MAP values calculated using this approach are considerably larger than those calculated using earlier approaches. The paper also discusses how the MAP is reduced when voltage limits for the VSC's internal voltage are considered. The paper also identifies problems with this consistent approach, as the Thévenin voltage at low SCR can be significantly greater than 1.0 pu. In the LCC this apparent voltage is adjusted by tap changer operation, and if a similar action is taken for the VSC, an unreasonably large tap ranger range would have to be assumed for a low SCR. As an alternative, the paper considers an ac network where some reactive power is locally supplied by shunt capacitors, which makes a Thévenin voltage close to 1.0 pu possible, and recommends that such a network be used when calculating the MPCs and MAP for a VSC converter."

Particularly, increased bulk power transmission, as well as large-scale integration of renewable energy sources act as main drivers for the development of HVDC technology. This paper deals with the development of a reliability/availability model for Voltage-Source Converter HVDC (VSC-HVDC) transmission systems for offshore and onshore applications, such as offshore wind farms connection or DC interconnectors. The goal of the present work is to develop vendor independent model for system reliability studies and sensitivity analysis of system availability. The proposed method overcomes the constraints that the currently dominating reliability and availability analysis methods introduce. A novel modelling tool - based on Bayesian Network theory - will be capable of serving as valuable asset towards design optimization and operational strategy of VSCHVDC systems. Two component-based modelling approaches are demonstrated within this study. The first is based on the Boolean logic of “operating” or “not operating” element, promising identical results with Fault Tree Analysis, but enabling identification of the weakest point in the system and sensitivity analysis as well. The second approach takes into consideration the distributive character of real components availability data, integrating in such a way uncertainty in the estimated output system availability."

The converter has similar advantages to other emerging modular multilevel converter circuits being considered for HVDC power transmission. However, during ac network unbalance the individual `chain-links' exchange unequal amounts of power with the grid which requires appropriate remedial action. This paper presents research into the performance of the converter and proposes a suitable control method that enables the converter to operate during grid voltage unbalance. The proposed control concept involves the use of asymmetric third harmonic voltage generation in the `chain-links' of the converter to redistribute the power exchanged between the individual `chain-links' and the grid. Mathematical analysis and simulation modelling with results are presented to support the work described."

        "abstract": "We consider a cognitive radio network, where primary users (PUs) share their spectrum with energy harvesting (EH) enabled secondary users (SUs), conditioned on a limited SUs' interference at PU receivers. Due to the lack of information exchange between SUs and PUs, the SU-PU interference channels are subject to uncertainty in channel estimation. Besides channel uncertainty, SUs' EH profile is also subject to spatial and temporal variations, which enforce an energy causality constraint on SUs' transmit power control and affect SUs' interference at PU receivers. Considering both the channel and EH uncertainties, we propose a robust design for SUs' power control to maximize SUs' throughput performance. Our robust design targets at the worst-case interference constraint to provide a robust protection for PUs, while guarantees a transmission probability to reflect SUs' minimum QoS requirements. To make the non-convex throughput maximization problem tractable, we develop a convex approximation for each robust constraint and successfully design a successive approximation approach that converges to the global optimum of the throughput objective. Simulations show that SUs will change transmission strategies according to PUs' sensitivity to interference, and we also exploit the impact of SUs' EH profile (e.g., mean, variance, and correlation) on SUs' power control."

Along with the development of social media applications, an increasing number of people combine texts and images to express their opinions. However, text based sentiment analysis methods cannot process other medias except texts. Therefore, visual sentiment analysis is born at the right moment. In this article, we review two multimodal-based visual sentiment analysis models proposed in our group. Both model exploit the multimodal content from correlation and hyper graph view respectively. In the Multimodal Correlation Model (MCM), we observe the correlation among different modalities and model then through a probabilistic graphical model. In the Hyper graph Learning Model (HLM), we use hyper graph to model the independence of each modality. We further discuss the underneath challenges and foresee potential opportunities of this direction."

However, the displacement of conventional thermoelectric power plants due to RES development can hinder safe operation of LCC-HVDC converters, especially during inverter operation, mainly due to the reduction of short circuit power on the ac network. These issues are exacerbated in small insulated networks with multi-infeed HVDC systems, such as the Sardinian one. Synthetic indexes such as MIIF, CFII and MIESCR, as well as time-domain simulations, are used to assess the robustness of the AC-DC system in presence of RES. Countermeasures such as converter control system improvements and installation of synchronous condensers are evaluated, aiming at a larger penetration of distributed generation."

However, the disturbance caused by the grid fault is so large that the output of the PV inverter would be saturated, which means the controller of the PV inverter would operate in nonlinear area. Consequently, the fault current transient features of the PV power generator are very complicated and much different from the steady-state fault characteristics. Aimed at it, the fault current transient features of the PV power generator are studied comprehensively in this paper, by taking the non-linearity of the PV inverter controller into consideration. The research results of this paper are of great importance for the establishment of equivalent model of PV power generator and fault analysis of the power grid with PV power generators."

Of the many measurement techniques for determining the gain of an antenna, the most accurate is the three-antenna extrapolation technique, in which measurements made in the near-field are extrapolated to give the infinite range, far-field gain. A metrology-level antenna gain measurement facility based on this technique has been developed at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China. This paper present a practical gain calibration of a WR10 (75 GHz - 110 GHz) standard gain horn (SGH) as an example of the verification of the new facility's performance.

The standard Steinmetz Equation is no longer valid and the alternative loss equations proposed in the literature are significantly more complicated. Therefore, many in the industry still use the Steinmetz Equation with the signal's Fourier Transform. However, the literature suggests this to be inaccurate without quantifying it. This paper will therefore compare the accuracy of this approach to a prominent alternative presented in the literature, the improved Generalised Steinmetz Equation."

On the other hand it is very important to define suitable fault detection methods. This is necessary since proven methods for AC grids cannot be applied in DC grids since they are too slow to cope with DC fault current phenomena. To clear DC faults it is important to have fast acting fault clearing but at least equally important to have very fast fault detection. For time critical and economical reasons it is also required to have a decentralized fault detection method. This paper describes basically DC fault current calculation, shows typical HVDC fault current characteristics and proposes an appropriate DC fault detection methodology for pole to pole as well as for pole to earth (in low- and high-impedance earthed DC grids) faults. Finally this fault detection algorithm is validated by numerical case studies."

The design process of the proposed microwave lens for X-band sensing application is implemented in SIW technology. In this work, a new lens with SIW technology is proposed to feed an array antenna to generate multiple beams. Since multiple beams are possible to be simultaneously obtained by reusing the antenna aperture, frequency and multiple functions can be incorporated in a single electronic system.

The proffered lens, which is comprised of seven beam ports, nine array ports and eight dummy ports, was designed to operate at the center frequency of 10-GHz, on an RO5880 substrate with electric permittivity of 2.2 and thickness of 0.508mm.

To perform dynamic reuse, it must be feasible for all links to maintain a certain signal quality despite the presence of interference. This can be ensured using reuse feasibility tests. However, state of the art testing algorithms show erroneous behavior when infeasibility occurs due to limited transmission powers. In this paper we develop two testing algorithms, based on nonnegative matrix theory, that explicitly take limited transmission powers into account and show how these can be implemented in protocols. The protocols are compared with the state of the art in terms of control channel usage, speed and accuracy of decision making. We find that the proposed protocols estimate reuse feasibility more accurately than the state of the art and are comparable in terms of speed and control channel usage."

Modular multilevel inverter, MMI(HB) using half-bridge submodules is recent and a potential candidate for PV application. Conventionally, the DC link of MMI has a centralized large DC source e.g. PV system connected across it. In the proposed topology, distributed PV system e.g. PV strings/ arrays are connected directly across dc link of MMI(HB) submodules (SMs). This allows easy expansion, independent monitoring of each PV string voltage and maximum power point optimization. The dynamics of PV generator is different from the conventional power generator, hence, a new combination of MPPT and decoupled dq controller is proposed to maximize the real power output from the PV strings and limit reactive power exchange with the grid as per the system requirements. In order to validate the proposed concept of new single-stage grid connected PV topology and its controller, simulations were conducted. A detailed model of the proposed 1800W, PV system consisting of 36 PV modules connected across a 13 level three phase MMI (HB) was established. The simulation results of new PV system during fast changes in solar irradiation and reactive power exchange has confirmed the feasibility of proposed MMI(HB) interface for single-stage grid connected high voltage, high power PV system and has verified the validity of the control strategy adopted."

Since the mechanical resonant frequency of the system will change with time and environment, the parameters of notch filter must be adjusted online with the resonant frequency. In this paper, according to the application requirements of mechanical resonance online suppressing, the mechanical resonance online suppressing algorithm based on adaptive IIR notch filter is proposed. Using a recursive least squares algorithm, resonant frequency of the system is online estimated, and then the frequency parameters of notch filter are adjusted online.

We compare a planar array geometry with both a horizontal and vertical antenna element arrangement, respectively. To quantify pairwise (two-user) orthogonality, we evaluate the cross-correlation between channel vectors averaged over more than 400 terminal positions. We benchmark those orthogonality relations among user positions with the reference case of an idealized channel matrix based on i.i.d. complex Gaussian distributed channel coefficients, as widely used in computer simulation. Furthermore, we compare indoor with outdoor measurements and find that, for both cases, further system gains may be achieved by increasing the number of base station antennas, in particular for the horizontal antenna geometry."

Then, it is worth noting the need of assuring the pavement rehabilitation quality of public roads, especially those classified as “Regular” or “Bad”. Pavement integral evaluation includes tests such as computing the International Friction Index (IFI), the International Roughness Index (IRI), performing geotechnical and deflectometry studies, and visual inspection of surface defects. In this work, pavement and base layers local thickness estimation based on computer vision methods is proposed. The pavement and base layers thickness estimation are part of geotechnical studies, providing structural properties of flexible pavements. Pavement and base layers thickness were computed using texture filters applied to stitched images acquired from an industrial video-scope. The results reported in this work are focused on comparing between different methods to estimate pavement and base layers thickness."

Increasing the number of levels of the output voltage at reduced circuit number switching elements, and performs waveform improvement. Typically, the ratio of the input voltage of the multi-level inverter is E1 : E2 = 1 : 1. When the ratio of the input voltage is 1 : 1, the number of the levels of the output voltage becomes only five-levels. Therefore, it increases the number of levels of the output voltage to a level seven by setting the ratio of the input voltage is E1 : E2=1 : 2. It is subjected to waveform improvement by increasing the number of levels of output voltage. Reducing the number of switching elements is advantageous for downsizing of the cost of the surface and the circuit. The simulated and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of seven-level operation in 6-switches inverter. Furthermore, this paper confirms same loss characteristics of the proposed multi-level inverter compare to the conventional NPC inverter."

We use the joint link-and-user scheduling method to maximize the long term average achievable rate of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying system. The optimal scheduling criteria is obtained and a two-step approach is proposed to implement it. In addition, we propose a rate allocation scheme of the source-relay (S-R) link to preserve the flow conservation constraint of each individual user. Furthermore, two reduced complexity joint link-and-user scheduling methods which use the zero forcing (ZF) beamforming in the relay-destination (RD) link are investigated.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we use the witness-functions to analyze cryptographic protocols for secrecy under nonempty equational theories. The witness-functions are safe metrics used to compute security. An analysis with a witness-function consists in making sure that the security of every atomic message does not decrease during its lifecycle in the protocol. The analysis gets more difficult under nonempty equational theories. Indeed, the intruder can take advantage of the algebraic properties of the cryptographic primitives to derive secrets. These properties arise from the use of mathematical functions, such as multiplication, addition, exclusive-or or modular exponentiation in the cryptosystems and the protocols. Here, we show how to use the witness-functions under nonempty equational theories and we run an analysis on the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol under the cipher homomorphism. This analysis reveals that although this protocol is proved secure under the perfect encryption assumption, its security collapses under the homomorphic primitives. We show how the witness-functions help to illustrate an attack scenario on it and we propose an amended version to fix it."

However, such worst-case deterministic approach does not provide explicitly an assessment of the probability of overloading the system, and the likelihood of the outages is treated equally. Recent research has focused on assessment of the line overloading risk index. This paper aims to extend the evaluation of the line overloading risk index through an extensive systematic evaluation of the steady state performance of the Dubai transmission network under hour-by-hour loading levels over a one year period. Load flow analysis is carried out for the intact system and all N-1 and N-2 contingencies. Over the same annual period, the thermal rating of all transmission lines is calculated, based on a detailed set of local meteorological data. Power flow computations are performed using a commercial load flow program and the systematic multiple study execution and data handling was achieved using a developed C++ based programming code. Over the period studied, the line overloading risk index and the probability distributions of line loadings and ratings is determined."

By using consensus algorithm and selecting the incremental cost of each DG as the consensus variable, economic dispatch of the VPP can be realized in a distributed manner. Therefore, only local communication among DGs is required and some performance limitations caused by centralized control can be avoided as well. However, the slow convergence speed is of concern in the distributed control. In this paper, mathematical analysis is presented to reveal factors influencing the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm. Specially, a convergence speed optimization method is developed to reduce the iterations, including communication network (CN) topology designing, edge weights optimization, and leader selecting. The performance of the optimization method is demonstrated through several simulation cases."

In order to determine this on-state resistance, specific measurement methods need to be developed. Since the drain source voltage of the device changes between hundreds of volts in the off-state and a few mill-volts in the on-state, an accurate determination of the on-state voltage VDSON is not achievable with standard measurement equipment due to the saturation of the DSO's input channel. In this paper, a voltage clamping circuit used to extract the dynamic on-state resistance RON of GaN HEMTs is presented. This method is based on a high-voltage, fast-switching zero recovery SiC Schottky diode. The circuit allows an accurate measurement of RON from 100 ns after turn-on to any arbitrary time and is feasible for operation at high switching frequencies up to 1MHz. Experimentally, the dynamic on-state resistance of 600V normally-off GaN HEMTs is investigated applying this method."

In this research, online reviews are analyzed to obtain consumers' fine-grained concerns. Specifically, aspects of product features and detailed reasons of consumers are extracted from online reviews. This research starts from the identification of product features and the sentiment analysis with the help of pros and cons reviews. Next, the approach of conditional random fields is employed to detect aspects of product features and detailed reasons jointly. In addition, a co-clustering algorithm is devised to group similar aspects and reasons to provide concise descriptions about CRs.

First, the images obtained using different sensors are decomposed into low and high frequency bands with the double-density dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DDDTCWT). Then two novel decision methods are introduced referring to the characteristics of the frequency bands, which significantly improves the image fusion performance for CWD application. The fusion of low frequency bands coefficients is determined by the local contrast, while the high frequency band fusion rule is developed by considering both the texture feature of the human visual system (HVS) and the local energy basis. Finally, the fused image is obtained through the inverse DDDTCWT. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach and indicate that the fusion rules can be applied to different multiscale transforms. Also, our work shows that the fusion result using the proposed fusion rules on DDDTCWT is superior to other combinations as well as previously proposed approaches."

A statistical assessment is first performed by calculating the expected steady-state DC voltage and power flow variations of the MTDC grid, induced by stochastic variations of the imported or exported power of each island system. The control strategies applied to the onshore converter controllers comprise predefined voltage - power regulation characteristics, which do not rely on communication infrastructure, such as droop control, voltage margin control, as well as droop control with dead-band. Further, a dynamic model is introduced for the MTDC grid in order to investigate its dynamic behaviour in outage conditions, i.e. following the sudden loss of an onshore converter. For this purpose, suitable control schemes are proposed for the island converters, capable of handling the power imbalance of the MTDC grid."

These will be determined with a decoupled method for inductive and capacitive coupling of different tower structures to get a first impression of the magnitude of the induced voltages. Also the influence of transposition for double circuit lines was taken into account. To determine the influence of both couplings a distributed line model was applied and a transmission corridor consisting of different tower structures was investigated considering varying load flow directions for the AC Systems."

This approach is carried out with a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI)-based multi-objective multi-model method. In each step, a single input and single output feedback controller is designed to increase system damping ratios of several inter-area oscillatory modes under nominal and off-nominal operating points. Regional pole placement and control effort optimization are set as the control objectives. Controller designs are implemented on a five-area 68-bus system and the test system is verified by non-linear simulations in real-time digital simulator (RTDS)."

In this paper, the modeling method is used to analyze some conventional power-system stability issues. It is demonstrated that the proposed modeling method gives a new interpretation of conventional power-system stability from a feedback-control point of view. The poles and zeros of the so-called Jacobian transfer matrix (JTM) are useful for understanding the properties of ac/dc systems."

Contrary to the frequency in an AC power system, the DC voltage cannot be assumed to be the same throughout the system, since a DC voltage difference is necessary to have a current flow. To operate HVDC grids as far as possible from DC voltage stability limits, the selection of the DC reference voltage and DC reference node are crucial factors. This paper introduces a method to find the optimal DC voltage in a HVDC grid based on power flow and line resistances. The method is implemented in the open-source software MatACDC and the results are verified by dynamic simulations in DIgSILENT, using a one area DC voltage restoration controller."

The EW wave propagation path is calculated with an analytical expression with some approximation for stand-off sensing, which is computationally efficient for CS imaging. Real data are used to validate the model proposed. It is shown that the CS imaging with the model proposed can yield better performance in locating and clutter suppression."

In specific literature, it is referred to the capability of VSC schemes being able to feed power into passive AC grids, hence with a short-circuit capacity equal to zero. However, for proper AC grid operation, there are constraints and power transmission limitations, which come inherently from the physical nature of the AC systems on the receiving and sending ends of the power interconnector, related to their capability to keep stable operating voltage. This paper intends to examine this aspect in order to shed some light on the issue of power transmission limitations for VSC HVDC interconnectors as a function of AC grid characteristics."

SiC MOSFET exhibit body diodes that feature a reverse recovery behavior almost as good as true parallel SiC SBDs even if reverse recovery time and recovery energy is a little higher and show some slight dependency on temperature. But this body diode presents significantly high VF. This VF becomes higher as the gate voltage become more negative. In this case it makes great sense implementing external SiC parallel diodes to lower the losses in reverse conduction and transfer those diode conduction losses from the SiC MOSFET body diode to the SiC diode. Biasing the SiC MOSFET with a positive gate voltage helps eliminating the need for parallel SiC diode in the third quadrant of operation.This paper will detail the performance of those SiC MOSFET phase leg options at different temperatures, gate voltages over the full range of current to help system designers optimize the use of SiC MOSFETs and carefully determine the need for parallel SiC SBDs."

Active switches, not designed for fault conditions, are tripped to minimize discharge currents effect on the semiconductor switches. Two levels of device protection are commonly in place; driver level protection monitoring collector-emitter voltage and overcurrent protection with feedback measurement and control. However, unavoidable tripping delay times, arising from factors such as sensor lags, controller sampling delays and hardware propagation delays, impact transient current shape and hence affect the selection of semiconductor device ratings as well as arm inductance. Analytical expressions are obtained for current slew rate, peak transient current and resultant I2t for the cell capacitor discharge current taking into account such delays. The study is backed by experimental testing on discharge of a 900V MMC capacitor."

The development of VSC technology has, and continues to be rapid, with new converter topologies and new manufacturers entering the market. For the power transmission industry to fully exploit the benefits of this rapidly developing field of engineering a \"multi-vendor\" supply chain is considered essential. However, unlike AC grids, there is at present no standardized Grid Code for HVDC grids and interoperability of equipment and systems, purchased from many different and competing suppliers, is a major concern. Compatibility of control between converters supplied by different manufacturers has been considered by different groups. The initial findings were that there was little reason to suggest that restrictions should be placed on which control strategy should be employed. However recent work undertaken by Cardiff University, on behalf of Alstom Grid, uncovered an adverse interaction between converters with differing operating modes. Using results taken from the studies, this paper illustrates how multiple operating points in the control characteristics could occur and show why such operation is undesirable."

However, when the traditional Newton method is adopted, Newton direction may not exist since Jacobian matrix of the equations may be singular. Although the quasi-Newton algorithm overcomes the singular problems, it confronts the common problem of converging to a local optimum value instead of the global optimum value. In this paper, we introduce two quasi-Newton algorithms, namely Spectral Approach for Nonlinear Equations (SANE) and Nonmonotone Spectral for Nonlinear Equations (NMSGNE), to solve this problem. The effectiveness of the proposed target location algorithms is verified via simulation."

We also show how nonlinear propagation performances of a WDM comb of Flex-PAM channels can be optimized operating on the power ratio between the four PAM constellations."

First, the eigenvectors of the spatial covariance matrix is sorted according to the descending order of the eigenvalues. Then, the modified spatial spectrum of each eigenvector is estimated in turn based on the projection features and orthogonal features. Finally, whether there is a signal source or not is judged by the ratio of the maximum value of the spatial spectrum to the mean value of the sidelobes, and the DOA of the signal is obtained by the angle corresponding to the maximum value. The method does not require the angle information of strong interferences. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method."

The threshold is usually computed as proportional to the standard deviation of the entire recording. Such thresholds increase with firing rate. Here, the firing rate dependence of “truncation thresholds”, which are thresholds that are computed using a different approach, is investigated through simulation. Simulated data are constructed using extracellular recordings from cortical area M1 of awake behaving rats. The findings show that, unlike other thresholds, truncation thresholds decrease in absolute value with firing rate. In this way, the value of these thresholds adapts to weed out the noise depending on the firing rate. The results show that truncation thresholds are better than the alternatives considered here at determining the noise component in extracellular recordings."

        "abstract": "Chaotic communication has become research hotspot in recent years. But in high speed data transmission communication, due to the restriction of chaos synchronization, its communicating effect is not superior to the traditional methods (such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying). In this paper a novel spatiotemporal chaos Hamilton oscillator is discussed in detail, and a new chaos M-ary digital modulation and demodulation method based on Hamilton oscillator is proposed. By using region controllable characteristics of chaos Hamilton oscillator in phase plane and chaos unique characteristic, which is sensitive to initial value, zone mapping method is proposed. Thus the M-ary information chaos modulation is realized. In addition, zone partition demodulation method is proposed based on the structure characteristic of Hamilton modulated information. Finally the communication system based on the two methods is constructed on the computer. The simulation shows that in high speed transmission communications and with no chaos synchronization circumstance, the proposed chaos M-ary modulation and demodulation method has outperformed some conventional M-ary modulation methods, such as QPSK in bit error rate. Besides, it has performance improvement in bandwidth efficiency, transmission efficiency and anti-noise performance, and the system complexity is low and chaos signal is easy to be generated."

Using disturbance sensitivity functions, the impact of attenuation of inrush currents due to different locations of current sensors (of inner current controller) is investigated. It is shown that placing the current sensor at the converter side of the transformer enable the inrush currents to attenuate faster and prevents the converter from overcurrent exposure, allowing it to more successfully ride-through faults."

This mechanism design is based on the attempt to capture the explicit or implicit needs in the form of \"weak signals\", or their consequences. It should capture the diverted actions from the objectives pursued by the \"decision maker\". Thus, a \"regulation\" of the system becomes possible.

This model enables the study of the effects of DC droop control on the power flows of the combined AC/DC system for steady state studies after VSC station outages or transient conditions without needing to use its complete dynamic model. Further, the proposed approach can be extended to include multiple AC and DC grids for combined AC/DC power flow analysis. The algorithm is implemented by modifying the MATPOWER based MATACDC program and the results shows that the algorithm works efficiently."

We take the contour as a person if the number of the pixels in the contour is more than a certain threshold, and the number of the contours is the number of people. In the end, we utilize the ratio of width to height of the contours to improve the accuracy."

        "abstract": "Aiming at complex data sets, affinity propagation clustering algorithm has shortcomings of clustering inefficiency and low accuracy. A semi-supervised affinity propagation clustering algorithm based on kernel function (K-SAP Clustering Algorithm) is proposed in this paper. This algorithm first maps the complex clustering space into the feature space and change the similarity measure by a kernel function. Then semi-supervised algorithm is used to adjust the similarity matrix to be neighbours of data in same cluster. Finally, AP algorithm is used to iterate and undate to get the global optimum. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm is better and more accurate than SAP algorithm for complex data sets clustering."

By conducting a detailed analysis of accessibility guideline application strategies, we state that projects that care about human diversity are viable and possible, and can increase the density of the research network that has the goal of expanding the Web, as well as the guarantee of Web access and Web use by everyone, regardless of disability."

        "abstract": "Inductive current sensors are established to measure the current waveform of fast semiconductors for switching characterization. A high bandwidth, low additional stray inductance and an easy use of the sensor are the main advantages of this current measurement technique. For applications which necessitate the use of current sensors with a large number of windings (e.g. Rogowski coils), the bandwidth of these sensors decreases due to the higher internal inductance. This paper presents three approaches to improve the performance of inductive current sensors by using additional external components or mathematic corrections. Furthermore, a new self-calibrating inductive current measurement system is presented, which simplifies the use of these sensors and makes the current measurement process more comfortable."

        "abstract": "Scalar non-uniform Lloyd-Max quantization (LMQ) is optimized for the minimum mean squared error satisfying the centroid condition, stating that the reconstruction level is the centroid of the area of the signal probability density function (PDF) in the respective quantization interval. For a given signal PDF, reconstruction levels are therefore time-invariant. Without predictive means at the encoder, scalar LMQ does not exploit source correlation at all. With the purpose of improving LMQ performance for correlated processes, we propose a novel scalar decoding approach employing a receiver-sided predictor inside a feedback loop. Based on the standard LMQ decision levels and utilizing the prediction error PDF shifted by the predictor output, a receiver-sided time-variant quantization codebook can be generated according to the centroid condition. Moreover, we give an analytical derivation of the variance of the prediction error. Simulations over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel in error-free and error-prone transmission conditions show that the proposed approach outperforms the standard LMQ by about 1.0 dB in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), especially for low rate quantization and highly correlated source processes."

The preferred measurement technique to characterize saturation behavior is small-signal inductance versus dc-bias. We recently presented a new method for simulating small signal inductance versus dc-bias currents [1, 2]. By using the proper material characteristics, this method allows the simulation of saturation effects due to differential mode and common mode currents. The simulation results are verified by measurements on a standard and a novel Common Mode Choke design under development."
