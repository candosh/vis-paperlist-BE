Such performance is useful in dynamic applications such as motor drives or converters to meet tracking requirements. This paper evaluates possible trajectory paths a buck or boost converter can take, and the use of geometric surfaces to guide these paths. Numerical procedures are developed to find a converter's system-limited response time and to give insight into the nature of switch solution sets. The paper reviews known sliding surfaces in the context of control objectives. Two different objective-specific surfaces are presented: one controls peak startup current and another recovers from any disturbance with one commutation"

The state of the art in automatic speech recognition has reached the point that searching for and extracting information from large speech repositories or streaming audio has become a growing reality. This paper summarizes the technologies that have been instrumental in making audio as searchable as text, including speech recognition, speaker clustering, segmentation, and identification; topic classification; and story segmentation. Once speech is turned into text, information extraction methods can then be applied, such as named entity extraction, finding relationships between named entities, and resolution of anaphoric references. Examples of deployed systems for information extraction from speech, which incorporate some of the aforementioned technologies, will be given."

Like linear programming, we have a fairly complete duality theory, and very effective numerical methods for these problem classes; in addition, recently developed software tools considerably reduce the effort of specifying and solving convex optimization problems. There is a steadily expanding list of new applications of convex optimization, in areas such as circuit design, signal processing, statistics, machine learning, communications, control, finance, and other fields. Convex optimization is also emerging as an important tool for hard, non-convex problems, where it can be used to generate lower bounds on the optimal value, and as a heuristic method for generating suboptimal points."

First, we scanned target space by using millimeter-wave radar combined with a gyro sensor. Then, due to detect humans and objects, we construct a 3D map from signal-reflection datasets using 3D image processing techniques. In this paper, we introduce our system and report the results of the measurement experiment in the real smoke space situation."

The ADP method provides optimal reconfiguration to achieve minimum real power losses in the network. It is also used to solve the UC problem as a two-stage optimization problem whereby one stage searches for the optimal solution and the other stage evaluates the objective function of the UC problem. The performance of the proposed schemes developed to highlight new optimization applications to power system operation and management challenges was tested on small-scale power system networks"

In this strategy, the length of queue is regarded as the control object and the length of queue on the contiguous phase is used to determine the timing plan. The simulation research and actual application show that this new control strategy is more near to the manned decision process and can perform the multi-phase signal traffic control of a single intersection more effectively than the fixed-time plan. The application result is satisfied"

How to separate overlapped cells to individual cells becomes the prerequisite of analyzing the micro cell images. In this paper, by introducing the theory of distance transform combining with watershed algorithm, a new algorithm of overlapped cell segmentation is proposed. This algorithm adopts distance transform to turn the position information of pixels to grey level information, and then adopts the watershed algorithm to realize the search and segmentation of the adhesion border of cell. The main characteristic of this method is that it can reduce the requisition of the quality of image, such as grey difference or noise level and so on. At the same time, it can calculate fast with high accuracy and steady result. So it is suitable for most overlapped cell images segmentation"

        "abstract": "This paper describes and evaluates a biologically-inspired network architecture that allows grid services to autonomously adapt to dynamic environment changes in the network. Based on the observation that the immune system has elegantly achieved autonomous adaptation, the proposed mechanism, the iNet artificial immune system, is designed after the mechanisms behind how the immune system detects antigens (e.g., viruses) and specifically reacts to them. iNet models a set of environment conditions (e.g., network traffic and resource availability) as an antigen and a behavior of grid services (e.g., migration and replication) as an antibody. iNet allows each grid service to autonomously sense its surrounding environment conditions (an antigen) to evaluate whether it adapts well to the sensed conditions, and if it does not, adaptively perform a behavior (an antibody) suitable for the sensed conditions. Simulation results show that iNet allows grid services to autonomously adapt their population and location to environmental changes for improving their performance (e.g., response time and throughput) and balancing workload"

The adaptive maximum-entropy arithmetic was introduced to initialize the segmentation, and the image pre-segmentation arithmetic based on fractal theory was presented. Performance of these models was simulated and analyzed. Simulation results indicate that the method given by this paper has good precision and great robustness. Furthermore, this method has little dependence on image pre-processing. The analyzed conclusions have guiding meaning for understanding and analysis of sonar image"

Movie-quality rendering of scenes of such complexity had only previously been possible with pure scanline rendering algorithms. Adding ray tracing to the renderer enables many additional effects such as accurate reflections, detailed shadows, and ambient occlusion.

Requirements for spoken language understanding for spoken dialog systems can range from the recognition of key words and phrases to a deeper understanding of the speaker's intentions. It is important to take account of the functional requirements of the overall system in order to determine the approaches and technologies that are most relevant for a particular type of dialog system. Within the research community the main focus over the past decade has been on a variety of data-driven methods in contrast to the hand-crafted approaches used predominantly in commercial systems. The main arguments for data-driven approaches are that they support more robust understanding and that they are ultimately more portable and less labour intensive. This tutorial reviews a number of different approaches to spoken language understanding within the context of conversational dialog systems, looking at issues such as coverage, robustness, context of deployment, and usability."

        "abstract": "A fuzzy intelligent controller based on BP neural network is proposed in this paper for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) speed control. The intelligent controller can remember fuzzy rulers by neural network, which has not only the simplicity and the nonlinear control ability of fuzzy control, but also the learning and adaptive functions by using neural network. In the double loop of PMSM speed adjustment system, the hysteresis current regulator is implemented in the current loop and the fuzzy intelligent control scheme is applied in the speed loop. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed controller is superior to the traditional PI controller. It has good dynamic and static characteristics because of its advantage in quick response and good robustness."

Most of current researches in ubiquitous computing try to build a smart environment by embedding sensors and computers in our living spaces directly. However, the approach is very expensive to make our environment smart. Our approach uses intelligent daily objects and personal devices to build a smart environment. This makes it possible to make our environment smart in an incremental way by replacing existing objects to new intelligent objects whenever a person wants. In our project, we are currently developing sentient artifacts that are intelligent daily objects embedding computers and sensors. Also, we are implementing middleware infrastructures for personal devices that allow us to control embedded services in an easy way."

The cost-based approach is used to determine the optimal operational strategy which yields a minimum operating cost. The optimal operational strategy is achieved through estimating the hourly generated power, the amount of thermal power recovered from the FCPP to satisfy the thermal load, the amount of power trade with the local grid, and the amount of hydrogen that can be generated from the FCPP. An evolutionary programming-based technique is used to determine the optimal operational strategy. The strategy is tested using electrical and thermal load profiles. Results are encouraging and indicate effectiveness of the proposed approach"

So the concept of chaos synchronization can be enlarged, from the synchronization of two chaos systems to the synchronization of chaos system and period system. The synchronization of the above two system can be realized by system error absolute value feedback control. The method above can also realize the synchronization of two systems that have different parameters by using adaptive control to adjust parameter first. The numerical simulation shows that error absolute value feedback control is a fast and valid method for logistic mapping synchronization"

Accordingly, in order to obtain the reasonable problem-solving scheme we designed the state observer and corresponding adaptive feedback controller in terms of Lyapunov stability theory, linear matrix inequality (LMI) and the idea of adaptive feedback control. Theoretically, the system is stable under the designed scheme. Experimentally, comparative results, related to composite nonlinear controller (CNF) reported, show that the proposed controller is of great superiority, while the slide head can rapidly track the desired track with high tracking performance"

With block properties, a low bound of partial schedule could be found in O(1), and then a branch and bound method was used to ignore most partial schedules. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can find near-optimal solutions for the large scale FSP in a short time"

The cycle is determined by the predicted Saturated Degree (SD) of the intersection with the highest intersection SD in the arterial and the SD predicted error of last cycle. The offset is determined by the vehicle speed between two intersections. The traffic demand intensity of each approach of one intersection determines the split. The Generic Algorithm is used to determine the Member Function of this fuzzy control model and the calculation model is also presented. The performance of this control model is compared to the model of fixed time at an arterial road with two intersections. The new control model wins over the traditional model in reducing average total delay of vehicles in arterial."

The chaos of the system is as an example when some power transfers between two generators and a certain value disturbance from electric network load. The random fractal characteristic was founded by bifurcation diagram research. And then phase diagram analysis, Lyapunov exponent chart analysis and Lyapunov dimension value calculation for marine electric power system approved that the marine power system was provided with characteristic of chaotic oscillation. The random fractal analysis is a well global method by using bifurcation diagram. It displays global parameter area coverage chaotic phenomena. It is an effective method for chaos analysis."

While the introduction of network gives the system some advantages, the jitter problem of system variables is induced and degrades the performance of systems. The optimal algorithm can be used to reduce the jitter of system variables. According to the CANopen transmission features, the real-time communication problems in CANopen are analyzed. The genetic algorithm is used to optimize the synchronous message scheduling. A multiple sensor network is simulated using the CANoe software. The result shows that the jitter problem in the network can be effectively reduced and the performance of the system can be improved."

To make the algorithm fit to on-line control, the efficient implementation of FCE method is also given. Applying the FCE controller in a ship steering control system, the simulation results show that the ship course can be properly controlled when changeable wind and wave exist.

Specially, overlay architectures based on proxies and leased lines can provide applications with optimal performance in terms of bandwidth, reliability, delay guarantee, etc. In this paper, we propose a balanced multicast routing algorithm for these proxy-based overlay architectures to utilize the network resources efficiently while keeping the delay guarantee for each multicast session. We first model the routing problem as a delay-constraint Steiner tree problem. Then, a balanced solution with the aid of precomputing is proposed. Extensive simulations show that our multicast routing algorithm provides superior performance with respect to other heuristics"

        "abstract": "The development of a novel capacitive sensor for three dimensional airborne ultrasonic ranging is described. In addition to the conventional range measurement obtained by ultrasonic sensors, our sensor provides angular information about echo signal bearing. The metallized coating of the transducer has been split in half by chemical etching in order to obtain a two element array for measuring the bearing angles associated with the range finders. A cross correlation technique has been applied to process the raw signal data in order to obtain the desired echo-signal phase delays. As a result, a low dispersion and linear relationship between the phase delays and bearing has been obtained within a 20deg cone. Unlike the other methods for bearing measurement, the described method uses the steady-state component in the transducer response to recognize the echoes in the noisy signal. This gives the method high robustness along with good accuracy characteristics, both of which are needed in practical applications"

In this paper, the fuzzy controller is used in the control system to deal with those problems. Under using of the fuzzy control technique, sensor technique, FIX technique and imaging technique, we gain the better intelligence control, increasing the accuracy and improving the stability and robustness of the system. As a result, the ginner can be free and save labor and excellent results are obtained"

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. Over the next decade, three complementary interfaces will shape how people learn: (1) the familiar webpages-and-windows \"desktop,\" (2) multi-user virtual environments (including sensory immersion via virtual reality), and (3) augmented realities based on mobile wireless devices and infused in real world settings. The \"millennial\" learning styles ascribed to the Net Generation stem primarily from the desktop interface; however, the growing use of virtual environments and augmented realities is fostering new forms of mediated learning in users of all ages. The crucial factor leading to this \"neomillennial\" learning is that the desktop interface is not psychologically immersive, while in contrast virtual environments and augmented realities induce a strong sense of \"presence.\" Psychological immersion enables a powerful pedagogy, situated learning, which is based on authentic contexts, activities, and assessment coupled with guidance from expert mentoring as well as tacit learning through collaborative activities. Through situated learning enabled by psychological presence, virtual environments and augmented realities is shaping participants' learning styles beyond what using sophisticated computers and telecom-munications has fostered thus far, with multiple implications for education and training."
