        "abstract": "Although many long-range imaging systems are designed to support extended vision applications, a natural obstacle to their operation is degradation due to atmospheric turbulence. Atmospheric turbulence causes significant degradation to image quality by introducing blur and geometric distortion. In recent years, various deep learning-based single image atmospheric turbulence mitigation methods, including CNN-based and GAN inversion-based, have been proposed in the literature which attempt to remove the distortion in the image. However, some of these methods are difficult to train and often fail to reconstruct facial features and produce unrealistic results, especially in the case of high turbulence. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently gained some traction because of their stable training process and their ability to generate high quality images. In this paper, we propose the first DDPM-based solution for the problem of atmospheric turbulence mitigation. We also propose a fast sampling technique for reducing the inference times for conditional DDPMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world data to show the significance of our model. To facilitate further research, all codes and pretrained models are publically available at http://github.com/Nithin-GK/AT-DDPM"

        "abstract": "We introduce a new architecture for unsupervised object-centric representation learning and multi-object detection and segmentation, which uses a translation-equivariant attention mechanism to predict the coordinates of the objects present in the scene and to associate a feature vector to each object. A transformer encoder handles occlusions and redundant detections, and a convolutional autoencoder is in charge of background reconstruction. We show that this architecture significantly outperforms the state of the art on complex synthetic benchmarks."

Furthermore, recent techniques integrating local search into CDCL have brought significant improvements, and local search is widely used in state of the art CDCL solvers as an important component. Similar results have also been observed in CDCL(T). This talk will introduce state of the art local search methods for SAT and SMT, and also present the recent techniques of combining local search and CDCL/CDCL(T)."

Taking the popular temperature scaling (TS) as a case in point, the key task is finding a matched temperature for the shifted test set. To address this issue, we pose an insight that temperature is strongly correlated with the shifting intensity by a tiny experiment. Based on the finding, we propose a simple yet effective approach named Surrogate Based Temperature Scaling (SBTS), where the surrogate model is trained to map the relationship between temperature and the shifting intensity. Empirical experimental results of various shift types on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that SBTS can significantly improve the calibration performance under distributional shift."

        "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL) system has recently become prominent as a concept to process data distributed across many individual sources without the need to centralize it. Multiple participants collaboratively train models based on their local data in a privacy-aware manner. To date, VFL has become a de facto solution to securely learn a model among organizations, allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising privacy of any individuals. Despite the prosperous development of VFL systems, we find that certain inputs of a participant, named adversarial dominating inputs (ADIs), can dominate the joint inference towards the direction of the adversary's will and force other (victim) participants to make negligible contributions, losing rewards that are usually offered regarding the importance of their contributions in federated learning scenarios. We conduct a systematic study on ADIs by first proving their existence in typical VFL systems. We then propose gradient-based methods to synthesize ADIs of various formats and exploit common VFL systems. We further launch greybox fuzz testing, guided by the saliency score of \"victim\" participants, to perturb adversary-controlled inputs and systematically explore the VFL attack surface in a privacy-preserving manner. We conduct an in-depth study on the influence of critical parameters and settings in synthesizing ADIs. Our study reveals new VFL attack opportunities, promoting the identification of unknown threats before breaches and building more secure VFL systems."

        "abstract": "Point clouds are playing an increasingly important roll in autonomous driving and robotics. Although current point cloud classification models have achieved satisfactory accuracies, most of them trade slight performance gains by stacking complex modules on the grouping-local-global framework, which leads to prolonged processing time and deteriorating interpretability. In this work, we propose a new pipeline named Fractual Projection Forest (FPF) that exploits fractal features to enable traditional machine learning models to achieve competitive performance with DNNs on classification tasks. Though compromises by few percentages in accuracy compared to DNNs, FPF is faster, more interpretable, and easily extendable. We hope that FPF may provide the community with a novel view of point cloud classification. Our code is available on https://github.com/Explain3D/FracProjForest."

        "abstract": "Burst super-resolution technique provides a possibility of restoring rich details from low-quality images. However, since real world low-resolution (LR) images in practical applications have multiple complicated and unknown degradations, existing non-blind (e.g., bicubic) designed networks usually suffer severe performance drop in recovering high-resolution (HR) images. In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing HR images from raw burst sequences acquired from modern handheld devices. The central idea is a kernel-guided strategy which can solve the burst SR problem with two steps: kernel estimation and HR image restoration. The former estimates burst kernels from raw inputs, while the latter predicts the super-resolved image based on the estimated kernels. Furthermore, we introduce a pyramid kernel-aware deformable alignment module which can effectively align the raw images with consideration of the blurry priors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can perform favorable state-of-the-art performance in the burst SR problem."

Finally, I will explain some of the future uses of quantum algorithms and what may be in store for the field in the next 10 years."

        "abstract": "Remarkable effectiveness of the channel or spatial attention mechanisms for producing more discernible feature representation are illustrated in various computer vision tasks. However, modeling the cross-channel relationships with channel dimensionality reduction may bring side effect in extracting deep visual representations. In this paper, a novel efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) module is proposed. Focusing on retaining the information on per channel and decreasing the computational overhead, EMA groups the channel dimensions into multiple sub-features and makes the spatial semantic features well-distributed inside each feature group. Specifically, apart from encoding the global information to re-calibrate the channel-wise weight in each parallel branch, the output features of the two parallel branches are further aggregated by a cross-dimension interaction method. The extensive experiments on common-used benchmarks, such as CIFAR100 for image classification, and object detection on MS COCO and VisDrone2019 datasets, are conducted which indicate that EMA outperforms several recent attention mechanisms significantly without changing networks depth."

        "abstract": "Numerous instances of dragon fruit diseases over the years have caused an estimated 14% annual crop loss globally, affecting untold millions of people. The study of dragon fruit illnesses, or pathology, aims to increase plants’ chances of surviving in the presence of pathogenic parasite microbes and poor climatic conditions. Environment-related elements that influence the development of dragon fruit diseases include temperature, pH, humidity, and moisture. Misdiagnosis can result in chemical overuse that costs money, environmental imbalance and pollution, and the establishment of pathogen strains that are resistant to treatment. The process of diagnosing diseases nowadays is time-consuming, expensive, and dependent on human scouting. Compared to the current method, automatic disease segmentation and diagnosis from dragon fruit photos can be somewhat useful. This study uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, to accurately identify four kinds of apple plant diseases from photographs of apple plant leaves. “Healthy,” “scab,” “rust,” and “many illnesses” are among the classifications."

On rare occasions, a dam will crack, releasing a tremendous amount of water. As a result, some water seeps into the soil, ‘overflowing’ the area. Rivers are intertwined with the banks of the river at a station. Aside from a lack of items and assets, municipal architecture rainwater contains germs and wastewater flows from dumping grounds and toxic leaks, resulting in various ailments. The purpose of this research is to identify the existence of water in river beds and assess whether it is in excellent condition. If the limit is surpassed, it alerts users via LED indicators, a buzzing sound, and internet apps. First, the physical unit is installed in places that are at risk of flooding. Next, the Internet of Things module serves as the transmitting unit. Finally, the sensors on the system measure the necessary data. The precise readings are shown on the LCD and sent to the IoT web application in real time. In this case, the Thing speaks web application stores data in a private channel, and the web application subsequently warns authorities and individuals when a flood arises."

Under the proposed plan, only authorized users will be able to access private and sensitive patient information, and unauthorized users will be unable to access a secure healthcare network. The various phases for implementing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the IoMT system have been discussed. AI-driven IoMT is implemented using decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbours (KNN) techniques. The KNN learning models are recommended for IoMT applications due to their low consumption time with high accuracy and effective prediction."

Besides, a threshold-based ternary function is optimized to get an approximated solution which can be fast and easily computed. TWNs have shown better expressive abilities than binary precision counterparts. Meanwhile, TWNs achieve up to 16× model compression rate and need fewer multiplications compared with the float32 precision counterparts. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets show that the TWNs achieve much better result than the Binary-Weight-Networks (BWNs) and the classification performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 is very close to the full precision networks. We also verify our method on object detection task and show that TWNs significantly outperforms BWN by more than 10% mAP on PASCAL VOC dataset.

To address these issues, we propose an improved detector YOLOv7-sea. Based on YOLOv7[2], we add a prediction head to detect tiny-scale people or objects. Besides, we integrate Simple, Parameter-Free Attention Module (SimAM) to find attention regions in the scene. To achieve further improvements to our proposed YOLOv7-sea, we provide some useful strategies such as data augmentation, Test time augmentation (TTA), and bundled box fusion (WBF). On the ODv2 challenge dataset, the AP result of YOLOv7-sea is 59.00%, which is about 7% higher than the baseline model (YOLOv7)."

The quality of ChatGPT’s natural speaking answers marks a major shift in how we will use AI-generated information in our day-to-day lives. For a software engineering student, the use cases for ChatGPT are manifold: assessment preparation, translation, and creation of specified source code, to name a few. It can even handle more complex aspects of scientific writing, such as summarizing literature and paraphrasing text. Hence, this position paper addresses the need for discussion of potential approaches for integrating ChatGPT into higher education. Therefore, we focus on articles that address the effects of ChatGPT on higher education in the areas of software engineering and scientific writing. As ChatGPT was only recently released, there have been no peer-reviewed articles on the subject. Thus, we performed a structured grey literature review using Google Scholar to identify preprints of primary studies. In total, five out of 55 preprints are used for our analysis. Furthermore, we held informal discussions and talks with other lecturers and researchers and took into account the authors’ test results from using ChatGPT. We present five challenges and three opportunities for the higher education context that emerge from the release of ChatGPT. The main contribution of this paper is a proposal for how to integrate ChatGPT into higher education in four main areas."

Many methods have been proposed to handle this problem, with most of the motivation coming from computer vision and deep learning methods. However, prevailing technologies have never effectively recognized tiny, dense things and often failed to detect objects that have undergone random geometric alterations. We analyze the current state of the art in object identification and propose a deformable convolutional network with adjustable depths to address these concerns. The results of our research suggest that they are better than the current best practices, blend deep convolutional networks with flexible convolutional structures to account for geometric variations, and get multi-scaled features. Next, we perform the remaining phases of object identification and region regress by up-sampling the fusion of multi-scaled elements. Experimental validation of our proposed framework demonstrates a considerable improvement in accuracy relative to time spent recognizing small target objects with geometric distortion."

Even when its dark out, infrared cameras are indispensable. Both military and civilian sectors will benefit from the use of such methods for night time navigation. On the other hand, IR photographs have issues with poor resolution, lighting effects, and other similar issues.

The specifics of the fuel and energy balance are such that more than 90% of all energy consumption is carried out through the use of coal. When burning coal, a lot of harmful substances are released, which have a great impact on the ecology of the city. This paper presents possible solutions: 1) Raising the pipe of the combined heat and power plant (CHP); 2) Gasification of the Krasnoyarsk CHP. The issue of conducting gas in Krasnoyarsk is considered. The analysis of the above-mentioned solutions is also carried out. The calculation of the costs for lifting the pipe, as well as for gasification, was carried out. Comparative tables of \"emissions from coal and gas\" and \"costs and efficiency between pipe lifting and gasification\" are given. Based on the results of the analysis, it can be concluded that these solutions can be used."

Temporal dependencies and relevant features are needed to identify timeseries anomalies. A GAN is trained to detect anomalies in timeseries data. The model performs better with synthetic data. Traditional ML models struggle with the difficulties of anomaly identification in time-series data due to issues such as dealing with high dimensionality, capturing temporal correlations, and detecting infrequent events with skewed class distributions. This study tested machine learning techniques for anomaly identification in time-series data using the Yahoo! Webscope S5 dataset. In terms of F1 score (0.912), precision (0.S99), recall (0.925), AUC-ROC (0.976), TP rate (0.925), and FP rate (0.045), the suggested approach beat the baseline methods. The suggested method uses GANs to generate synthetic data for anomaly identification in time-series data."

Building upon the pure motion-based method OC-SORT, we achieve 1st place on MOT20 and 2nd place on MOT17 with 63.9 and 64.9 HOTA, respectively.

Two baseline methods, vanilla fine-tuning (V-FT) and task adaptive pretraining (TAPT) are first presented. We show that V-FT is able to outperform state-of-the-art models on the IEMOCAP dataset. TAPT, an existing NLP fine-tuning strategy, further improves the performance on SER. We also introduce a novel fine-tuning method termed P-TAPT, which modifies the TAPT objective to learn contextualized emotion representations. Experiments show that P-TAPT performs better than TAPT, especially under low-resource settings. Compared to prior works in this literature, our top-line system achieved a 7.4% absolute improvement in unweighted accuracy (UA) over the state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP.

If a company is sincere about remaining ahead of the competition, it must do everything possible to prevent its employees from leaving in droves. To comprehend the factors contributing to employee turnover in enterprises, this article examines employee turnover. The worker was assigned to one of several predetermined attrition categories primarily based on employee demographic and employment history information. Python was used to develop decision tree models and rule sets. A predictive model was constructed using the results of the developed rule sets and decision tree models to predict future employee turnover cases.

In the case of Parkinson's disease, for example, early diagnosis and understanding might allow patients to adopt preventative measures before the onset of clinical symptoms. In cases when no effective therapies exist, machine learning mPDe provides a means of making an early diagnosis and thereby improving patient outcomes. A loss of brain function, like in the case of Dementia, impairs the ability of the rest of the body to function normally. In medicine, the application of machine learning models is known as “quantum intelligence,” and it is used to determine which drug combinations work best. In terms of technology and automation, quantum computing or intelligence is among the highest. We're attempting to apply quantum intelligence to a dataset about Parkinson's disease. Models of machine learning and deep learning, such as random forests, decision trees, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and so on, are applied to a variety of generic datasets. OASIS is a specialized neuroimaging dataset with a variety of MRI patient dimensions. This can be incorporated into future studies. We are employing 3D brain pictures to diagnose the tumour using machine learning models, and MRI has multiple facets to be taken into account before arriving at a diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has two variations, known as T1 and T2. When it comes to fMRI, PET, and similar technologies, we've got you covered. Decision trees and random forest algorithms from machine learning, along with neural networks and RNNs from deep learning, were used to attain the desired accuracy."

Behavioural features that separate one person from another and may be clearly seen when interacting with individuals in one's immediate surroundings and social group are included in this category of traits. To improve good healthy discourse, a variety of ways for evaluating candidate personalities based on the meaning of their textual message have been developed. According to the research, the textual content of interview responses to conventional interview questions is an effective measure for predicting a person's personality attribute. Nowadays, personality prediction has garnered considerable interest. It analyses user activity and displays their ideas, feelings, and so on. Historically, defining a personality trait was a laborious process. Thus, automated prediction is required for a big number of users. Different algorithms, data sources, and feature sets are used in various techniques. As a way to gauge someone's personality, personality prediction has evolved into an important topic of research in both psychology and computer science. Candidate personality traits may be classified using a word embedding model, which is the subject of this article."

The open-source model and affordable access to Android platforms enable smartphone users with multiple free applications and on the other hand, the same platform can be misused by attackers to achieve their goals. Android Ransomware attack is one of the majorly used attacks in the android malware domain and can affect android users with huge information and financial losses. Smartphone users store their personal to professional all kind of information in their smartphones and data breaches from the same source can put them in harmful circumstances. This research article focuses on android ransomware network architecture for detailed analysis and forming a further roadmap for the detection of such attacks. With technological capabilities, the detection of ransomware attacks at an early stage can secure from at least some levels of losses. Threat intelligence can be created using artificial intelligence-based methods for android malware attacks, but that requires clear identification of attributes and features that are involved in a particular cyberattack. In this experimental study, we have worked on CIC-AndMal2017 dataset that is being created by generating android malware attacks on real smartphones. We targeted the android ransomware attacks from this dataset and performed detailed exploratory data analysis to conclude the behaviour of different android ransomware attacks. The results drawn from this experimental study help the researcher to build artificial intelligence-based ransomware detection methodologies for the android platform."

In the meanwhile, a vision system is a cutting-edge method that is becoming more popular for measuring pictures of the specimen to determine the roughness of the machined surface. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the machined surface are captured by a vision system for this study. During the final turning process, two-dimensional pictures of the machined surface of the Monel K 500 alloy are used to estimate the profile of the surface of specimens. Surface roughness of simulated specimens was investigated by image analysis under different simulated machining settings. This study employs a method for identifying surface texture that combines the acquisition of 2D surface pictures with a wavelet transform-based strategy. The Two-Dimensional Wavelet Transform may be utilized in the process of assessing surfaces due to its ability to deconstruct an image of a machined surface into a multi-resolution representation of that surface's multiple attributes. Prediction errors of less than 1.674% were obtained by analysing the histogram frequency difference of a lit area of interest (ROI) in images of rotated surfaces."

One of the vital elements of blood are white blood cells (WBC). Manually identifying WBC under a microscope requires a significant amount of time and effort, and this procedure is susceptible to human error, which might result in wrong interpretation. The automated systems for recognizing and categorizing the various types of WBC have major medicinal applications in this field. Despite the fact that the deep convolution neural network method gave decent results for categorizing WBC images. In the proposed study, a CNN-based deep learning algorithm is used to identify WBC.

A control system must be integrated with an automation to conduct the day-to-day challenging task in an easy way and can save a time and cost of manual operation. In India some of the farmers are using their own techniques of smart farming. But in some areas smart farming is not yet developed due to less knowledge about the technology. Some farmers are using the technologies that can increase the crop yield directly but in some scenarios crop yield can be increased by using some indirect ways. Some of them are borewell charging, poly house water management automation, submersible motor automation, etc. in our survey we found that if farmers are using a new technology there are some misleading concepts, they have regarding it so to nullify the problem of farmers we are introducing a smart device that can be used to automate the motor starter remotely."

However, it is difficult to integrate such system with common home furniture for its three-dimensional (3-D) structure, which degrades its practicality. Targeting at this challenge, this article proposes a novel planar omnidirectional WPT system, enabling 3-D omnidi-rectional WPT for consumer electronics, such as mobile phones and earphones. It consists of three sets of planar coils, which can generate magnetic field in three dimensions, enabling the receiver to be charged in all positions and orientations. Besides, the decoupling performance of the proposed coil structure is verified. Afterwards, a LCCL-LC resonant converter is utilized to achieve the constant output voltage gain at resonant frequency. Finally, in the experiment, three sets of coils are integrated as PCB windings and the magnetic field is measured to verify the omnidirectional magnetic field distribution under 6.78MHz. When charging a 5-W receiver for portable devices, the output voltage will be between 16-24V while the overall efficiency is 70%-72.5% with $x$ and $y$ misalignment. Considering the angular misalignment, the efficiency remains between 28%-53%."

Very recently, methods based on diffusion models (DM) have been gaining the spotlight. In addition to providing an impressive level of photorealism, they enable the creation of text-based visual content, opening up new and exciting opportunities in many different application fields, from arts to video games. On the other hand, this property is an additional asset in the hands of malicious users, who can generate and distribute fake media perfectly adapted to their attacks, posing new challenges to the media forensic community. With this work, we seek to understand how difficult it is to distinguish synthetic images generated by diffusion models from pristine ones and whether current state-of-the-art detectors are suitable for the task. To this end, first we expose the forensics traces left by diffusion models, then study how current detectors, developed for GAN-generated images, perform on these new synthetic images, especially in challenging social-network scenarios involving image compression and resizing.

Different from the conventional DC bus architecture, the switching bus architecture removes the bulky DC bus capacitors and reduces the number of switches. Compared with existing 48-to-1-V hybrid SC demonstrations, the proposed converter achieves the highest SC stage conversion ratio with the lowest normalized switch volt-ampere (VA) rating, which promises lightened conversion burden on the following buck stage and reduced switch stress.

By reconstructing full images from partially masked inputs, a ViT encoder aggregates contextual information to infer masked image regions. We believe that this context aggregation ability is particularly essential to the medical image domain where each anatomical structure is functionally and mechanically connected to other structures and regions. Because there is no ImageNet-scale medical image dataset for pre-training, we investigate a self pre-training paradigm with MAE for medical image analysis tasks. Our method pre-trains a ViT on the training set of the target data instead of another dataset. Thus, self pre-training can benefit more scenarios where pre-training data is hard to acquire. Our experimental results show that MAE self pre-training markedly improves diverse medical image tasks including chest X-ray disease classification, abdominal CT multi-organ segmentation, and MRI brain tumor segmentation.

Its major purpose is to accurately predict the user’s emotions, and play songs depending on the user’s preferences. Using Human Computer Interaction (HCI), the proposed bot recognizes human emotions from facial emotions. Another significant challenge is the extraction of facial features from the user’s face. The proposed CNN Algorithm is utilized in the proposed model to properly capture and recognize the user’s face from the live webcam stream and to detect emotions based on facial factors such as lips and eyes.

        "abstract": "Advanced artificial-intelligence (Al) edge devices require high energy-efficiency $(\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}})$ and high inference-accuracy [2,4-6]. An SRAM-based compute-in-memory (CIM) based on MAC operations is well-suited for improving the $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$ of Al edge devices. However, without support for floating-point (FP) computation, Al chips using integer-based SRAM-CIMs (INT-CIM) [2,4-5] are prone to precision loss when applied to complex datasets or neural network models. Product $(\\text{PD}=\\text{IN}\\times \\mathrm{W})$. alignment-based FP-MACs align the product's mantissa $(\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{M}})$ prior to accumulation, based on the product's exponent $(\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}})$. This approach is commonly used for digital circuits [3] and for near-memory compute [1], but is not practical for in-memory-compute (IMC) macros: each $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}$ within a physical row/column is different and thus cannot be accumulated. An INT-IMC with off-macro digital circuits and off-chip software pre-alignment was used in [6] to process the exponents of inputs $(\\text{IN}_{\\mathrm{E}})$ and weights $(\\mathrm{W}_{\\mathrm{E}})$ externally for the FP-MAC. An INT-CIM with extra FP-to-INT converters can emulate an FP-MAC, but incurs additional area, power consumption, and latency (PPA). Researchers have yet to develop a true FP-IMC macro capable of exponent and mantissa computation. Analog CIMs suffer from a low readout accuracy due to intrinsic transistor variation. Digital CIMs are insensitive to variation, but are limited in terms of compute parallelism due to routing congestion, as Fig. 7.1.1 shows. This paper presents a true FP-IMC macro featuring (1) a hybrid-domain macro structure that enables computation of both the exponent and mantissa in an FP-MAC within the same IMC macro. A high $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$ and accuracy are achieved by exploiting advantages of computing in the time, digital, and analog-voltage domain by identifying the proper functional blocks for the FP-MAC [2,4-5]. (2) Time-domain based $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}$ generation, a $\\text{maximum}-\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}(\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}-\\text{MAX}})$ finder (TD-MPEF), and a $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}-\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}-\\text{MAX}}$ generator $(\\text{TD}-\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}-\\text{DG})$ to achieve a high $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$ for all exponent computation. (3) $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}$ -based input-mantissa alignment (PEB-IMA) scheme to enable accumulation for $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{M}}$ in the same column. (4) A place-value dependent digital/analog-hybrid computing scheme for mantissa computation with a high inference accuracy and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$. A 22-nm 832-kb FP SRAM-IMC macro is fabricated using foundry-provided compact-6T SRAM cells. The FP SRAM-IMC support FP-MACs with 128-accumulators (ACCU) for BF16 inputs (IN) and weights (W) with FP32 outputs (OUT) and achieves the highest reported FP-MAC $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$, 70.2TFLOPS/W."

In this research, a home automation system is developed for the elders because as the number of elders rises, so does the probability that patients will develop geriatric problems, which necessitates society to address the issue. It is especially beneficial for senior citizens and disabled youngsters. Many research and innovation are conducting on in the field of gestures recognition. In this project, home automation is performed through the use of gestures to control appliances and contradicting the computer vision approaches as an elder person is not capable for ensuring the environment for the computer vision techniques as it requires proper lightning conditions and angle to ensure the parameters. Sensor embedded Hand glove that collects hand motions has been discussed in this study. The wearable device detects and records tilting, rotation, and acceleration of the hand movement using accelerometers and gyroscopes. Our proposed human gestures recognition (HGR) system recognizes nine different hand gestures taken from benchmarked dataset. We used a combination of features extraction algorithms and a random forest classifier to compare our system's performance with other well-known classifiers. We have achieved an accuracy of 94% over the benchmark HGR dataset. Experiments have shown that the proposed approach has the capability to recognize gestures for controlling home appliances and can be used in healthcare, residences, offices, and educational environments."

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) system is facing a large number of attacks nowadays. Distributed Denial of Ser-vices(DDoS) attack is the most reported attack in the field of security. Nowadays these attacks are increasing very rapidly. However, it has been difficult to predict and detect these attacks easily. In this paper, various existing machine learning (ML) algorithms are being analyzed that are used to predict and detect DDoS attacks using different existing datasets namely; ToN-IoT, CICDDoS2019 and BoT-IoT. The four types of different ML algorithms have been deployed which include K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Naive Bayes(NB), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF). The major goal of this analysis is to choose the best ML technique. Comparing the existing BoT-IoT dataset to the other datasets utilised in this paper, provides the best measure. The evaluation findings demonstrate that the decision tree and random forest classifiers provide the highest levels of accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the security concerns associated with DDoS attacks and their mitigation."

        "abstract": "In numerous locations, hardware switches are utilized to control various equipment like household devices, industrial devices, etc. The use of physical switches has drawbacks, induding the risk of electric shocks from structural damage and the expense of replacement due to wear and tear. The proposed model replaces switches with a virtual environment, and an image processing technique is deployed to collect the visual data to control various devices utilizing electromagnetic relays. In this work, Dynamic Vision Sensor is used as a bioinspired sensor which replaces the physical switch. In essence, electromagnetic relays are utilized for device control. Further, the raspberry controller uses a transmitter and receiver pair to wirelessly communicate data to it, so that it can control devices by activating and deactivating electromagnetic relays. This reduces the need for wiring and hence lowers the cost of wiring. Since the proposed concept is not a physical device, it also prevents the risk of shock whenever the structure is compromised. It is also transportable, and a 2D projector can be utilized to create a virtual environment on any flat surface."

        "abstract": "Over 2.4 % of deaths in India each year are caused by liver diseases. Due to its mild early signs, liver disease is also challenging to diagnose. Frequently, the signs only become obvious when it is too late. Even more challenging than segmenting the liver is segmenting the tumour from the liver. Imaging procedures like computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound are utilised to separate the liver and liver tumour once a sample of liver tissue has been removed. This research suggests a machine learning method from CT images-based automatic assistance system for stage categorization. Then, the features are extracted from the CT images using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method. Finally, it is suggested that the computed tomography (CT) pictures of livers containing tumours be categorised using a Random Forest technique. Using the described method, liver tumour images are classified as benign or malignant. The real value accuracy for liver segmentation was found to be approximately 99.55%, 97.85%, and 98.16% based on the experimental investigation. Using the described method, liver tumour images are classified as benign or malignant. These modifications improve the system’s ability to recognise the tumour from the CT pictures."

There are required to detect breast cancer early stages so the necessary steps should be taken as early as possible to stop this disease first we need more research in this field. So, in this work, we are trying to build a sustainable machine-learning model which can detect the type of breast cancer whether benign or malignant. Through the detection, we proposed the best model which can detect this outbreak efficiently. In our study, we examined the performance of five machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) in predicting human health behavior. Among these algorithms, XGBoost had the highest accuracy (95.42%) and performed well in terms of sensitivity (98.5%), specificity (97.5%), and F-1 score (99%). Our findings suggest that XGBoost has promising potential in predicting breast cancer, but further research is needed to develop and apply it for commercial use in the healthcare industry."

In other fields, attention based Transformers [1] have shown their ability to integrate information over long sequences. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Transformer Demucs (HT Demucs), an hybrid temporal/spectral bi-U-Net based on Hybrid Demucs [2], where the innermost layers are replaced by a cross-domain Transformer Encoder, using self-attention within one domain, and cross-attention across domains. While it performs poorly when trained only on MUSDB [3], we show that it outperforms Hybrid Demucs (trained on the same data) by 0.45 dB of SDR when using 800 extra training songs. Using sparse attention kernels to extend its receptive field, and per source fine-tuning, we achieve state-of-the-art results on MUSDB with extra training data, with 9.20 dB of SDR."

        "abstract": "In Al-edge devices, the changes of input features are normally progressive or occasional, e.g., abnormal surveillance, hence the reprocessing of unchanged data consumes a tremendously redundant amount of energy. Computing-in-memory (CIM) directly executes matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in memory, eliminating costly data movement energy in deep neural networks (DNNs) [2–6]. Prior CIM work only explored the sparsity of DNNs to improve energy efficiency, but the trend of employing non-sparse activation functions, e.g., leaky ReLU, degrade the benefits of leveraging sparsity [1]. Even if sparsity can be exploited, the redundant unchanged input features in analog CIM still consume massive amount of dynamic power (Fig. 7.8.1). From a circuit point-of-view, the energy consumption of analog CIMs is dominated by full-precision ADCs. In different DNN applications, the mean of analog CIM outputs is unpredictable and fluctuating, which requires the ADC to have a high dynamic range to guarantee coverage, introducing a high-power overhead."

The existing systems like K-mean clustering technique and the neural network can detect only 80-90% of illnesses. Using computer vision and machine learning approaches, this research suggests an innovative and effective method for identifying crop pathology. The proposed approach uses the object detection technique's experimental solution, known as YOLO, to find plant disease. YOLO processes leaf images at a real-time rate of 45 frames per second, which is quicker than existing object detection methods. Before processing the image, it divides the image into a number of grid cells. A single neural network can forecast the bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single assessment. With the use of the proposed algorithm, farmers will be able to identify diseases in their early stages, diagnose leaf diseases, and then control the crop as needed to maintain the health and safety of plants."

This is because moving all the data, apps, and hardware to the cloud is a very involved operation. It may be difficult to predict how long it will take to complete a cloud migration owing to the many variables that might emerge throughout the process. A better understanding of the cloud migration’s complexity is necessary for establishing a time estimate. Migration to the cloud may be simple or difficult, depending on the scale and complexity of the organization’s current infrastructure and the chosen cloud solutions.

P3F BAW technology benefits from a significantly larger film thickness than the traditional BAW thickness-frequency scaling approach, enabling a manufacturable, high quality-factor (Q), and high frequency resonator technology. A P3F material stack was realized using a combination of single and polycrystalline AlScN layers with desired polarity of layers as deposited, which enables volume manufacturing. An AlScN P3F BAW resonator was manufactured using XBAW®, a unique and patented transferred substrate process technology for next generation resonator and filter solutions. The fabricated P3F BAW resonators demonstrated 2nd overtone operation at 10.7 GHz & 18 GHz, and exhibits a FoM, (Qp × kt2) of 27 and 20, respectively.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, emails play a major role in everyone’s day-to-day life. The number of people using email is rapidly growing. Because of this, the hackers are taking advantage of the opportunity to use the emails as their secret weapons against the email users. The hackers send a bulk of emails at a time with a single click. The majority of spam mail contains advertisements or promotions for various events, utilities, appliances, and so on. A single Spam email results in a net loss for the user. Even with current technology, there are numerous techniques and methods for distinguishing between spam and ham mail, but spammers are finding ways to get the user's attention and developing themselves due to the decreased effectiveness of techniques. So, our study comes up with effective classifiers in this paper. In this research paper, ML and deep learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Long Short-Term Memory, and Bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory are used to identify which model is more accurate to classify the emails as spam or ham."

        "abstract": "It can detect ambient conditions and convey data for processing purposes; In recent years, the wireless sensor network has surpassed all other networks in popularity. The implementation of WSNs is fraught with several significant obstacles, such as concerns over energy usage and safety. WSNs are potentially vulnerable to a wide variety of assaults, any one of which might compromise their capacity for reliable communication or lead to the loss of sensitive data. Consequently, as the network deployment gets more extensive and intricate, there is a massive increase in the requirement for intrusion detection-based energy-efficient approaches. The effectiveness of the networks may be evaluated via the use of Qualnet simulation. Using an artificial neural network and a MATLAB Simulink model, this study intends to improve the effectiveness of a power-based intrusion detection strategy. The results reveal that WSN’s detection of intrusions is enhanced by using an ideal technique inspired by biological nervous systems. Not only that, but the unguarded nodes are having a negative effect on network performance and producing disturbances in the network’s behavior. Both methods use regression analysis to distinguish between fully protected and partially protected nodes. Therefore, the packet delivery ratio and the power consumption of the network may be used for accurate node identification in an artificial neural network."

However, the existing steganalysis CNNs have not achieved optimal performance detecting accuracy and network stability. In this research, we propose a new approach within CNN to improve the secret data detection accuracy by optimizing the local features in the feature extraction stage of the spatial domain images. The performance is evaluated using the Break Our Steganographic System Base (BOSSBase) dataset with two standard adaptive steganography algorithms employing low payload capacities of 0.2 and 0.4 bits per pixel. The experimental results outperform the results of the previously published works in accuracy and network stability. The detection accuracy is improved in a range between 2.1% to 3.6%."

This work presents a comparison between the Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based approach and ResNet50 for classifying coffee type and maturity using transfer learning. Coffee cherries of different stages and varieties may be automatically sorted and recognized. Many ways to solve this problem have been proposed with transfer learning emerging as the dominant option due to its outstanding performance. This research work has implemented the Deep CNN Transfer Learning to detect distinct phases in the coffee cherries datasets. The suggested model employs VGG 16 for classifying coffee type and maturity got 96.38% accuracy and using ResNet50 for classifying coffee type and maturity with 99.01% accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that the suggested strategy is practical and that it would be used to detect efficiently and outperform other methodologies."

The most commonly used renewable energy source is solar and PV systems, which have attained great importance as a source linked to transmission networks. PV systems, when integrated with grids, create power quality problems due to using nonlinear electronic devices. To improve power quality, filters are necessary to clear out the harmonics and distortion and to improve the power factor improvement. SAPF (Shunt Active Power Filter) is needed to cancel out the system's undesired signals to balance the imbalance currents and reactive power compensation. SAHF (Shunt Active Harmonic Filter) is required for compensation of harmonics by producing equal but 180° in phase current. In this paper, PV based SAHF is analyzed with the help of MATLAB/ SIMULINK to reduce the current harmonics and provide load compensation. To extract maximal power, P&O (Perturbation & Observation) based technique is needed. The SAHF is created with VSI, and a controller offers a triggering signal for VSI (Voltage Source Inverter). This paper contains the system analysis with and without SAHF, and THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) is measured using the FFT (Fast Fourier Technique) technique."

However, because CKD (Chronic Kidney disease) is a disease with no symptoms or, in some cases, no symptoms at all, it is difficult to predict, detect, and prevent such a disease, which could result in long-term health damage. However, machine learning (ML) offers hope in this situation because it excels at prediction and analysis. In this paper, we proposed nine ML approaches, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), Naïve Bayes, Extra tree classifiers, AdaBoost, Xgboost, and LightGBM. These predictive models are built using a dataset on chronic kidney disease with 14 attributes and 400 records to choose the best classifier for predicting chronic kidney illness. The dataset was gathered via Kaggle.com. Additionally, this study has compared how well these model's function. With the LightGBM model, we could predict kidney illness more accurately than ever before, with a 99.00% accuracy level."

Consequently, choosing an electric vehicle has no emissions, leaves a reduced carbon footprint, and ultimately helps the environment. A further assurance that no CO2 is released during any stage of vehicle usage is provided by using renewable energy to charge EVs from sources like solar, etc. Given the rising price of gasoline, electric cars are both immediately and in the long run much more inexpensive than ICE cars. The average cost of operating a fuel-powered car is between Rs. 10 and Rs. 15 per km.

        "abstract": "When communicating confidential information between two parties, it is crucial to consider the security of the information. Cryptography, as well as steganography, are essentially used to keep hidden, secret data. Cryptography mainly focuses on changing private messages into an unreadable format. However, cryptography is questionable because it shows the existence of covert communication; hence there is a need to use it combined with other more secure techniques. On the other hand, steganography conceals confidential data in a cover media to avoid suspicion of covert communication. Most practitioners use different steganographic algorithms selected based on their capacity to carry large payloads with a quality cover image. This paper introduces a new algorithm to hide confidential data using fuzzy logic in digital images with increased payload and high imperceptibility. We use fuzzy logic to identify an image’s edges, which shows the level with which a pixel is attached to any edge during image processing; then, we apply a factor to the data to hide before embedding it to the pixels with low values. Our method effectively conceals large amounts of secret bits while producing a quality stego image that ensures confidentiality in communication through the insecure public network. Experimental results demonstrate the outperformance of our method over the existing schemes for both the peak signal-to-noise ratio and the payload size."

        "abstract": "High power density and high-efficiency inverter is required for electric aircraft application due to the restriction of volume and weight. In this paper, a prototype of a 150 kVA inverter using wide bandgap SiC has been developed for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft application. The thermal properties of the SiC MOSFET have been analyzed and a corresponding air-cooled heatsink has been designed and tested. The gate driver circuit is carefully designed to minimize the stray inductance and the ringing of voltage is mitigated. The inverter system has been tested with 700V input and 70A phase current at a 20 kHz switching frequency. For the control of the 3-phase inverter, this design proposed an FPGA-based control board for high-resolution high-speed modulation index adjustment. A system power density of 47 kW/L is estimated to be achieved with a dimension of 110*155*185 mm."

        "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization (CO) is vital for making wiser decisions and planning in our society. Annealing computation is a promising CO approach derived from an analogy to physical phenomena (Fig. 2.3.1). It represents a CO problem as an energy function, a quadratic form of {1, -1} vectors, where each binary element is called a (pseudo) spin. The spin vector is initialized randomly and is updated stochastically to find minimum energy states by gradually reducing the (pseudo) temperature. Local-connection annealers (quantum [1] and non-quantum [2-4]) have been constrained to spin models having only local inter-spin couplings. This restriction, however, severely limits their CO applications even with the help of clever graph embedding algorithms. Full-connection annealers [5], [6], considered here, have been proposed to address this drawback, permitting handling of arbitrary topologies and densities of inter-spin couplings, even if they are irregular."

SRAM-CIMs have effectively implemented high integer (INT) precision multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations to improve the inference accuracy of various image classification tasks [1]–[3],[5],[6]. To realize more complex AI tasks, such as detection and segmentation, and to support on-chip training for better inference accuracy, floating-point MAC (FP-MAC) operations with high-energy efficiency are required. However, most SRAM-CIMs that previously used digital [5], [6] or analog [1]–[4] in-memory computing cannot effectively support FP-MACs: e.g., Brain Float16 (BF16) datatype. Since supporting high floating-point input (IN), weight (W) and output (OUT) precision for SRAM-CIM may cause (1) inconsistency between the shift-alignment of conventional digital FP-MACs and the structured mapping of most SRAM-CIMs, and (2) results in a more difficult tradeoff between throughput/memory size (T/S), energy efficiency (EF), and memory density (MD), as shown in Fig. 7.2.1."

However, when using the model-based approach, the image is recreated using many models, including volumetric, geometric, and others. The key difficulty in gesture control continues to be the ML individual's complexity and preparation time. Its accuracy is used to assess the HGR accuracy.

        "abstract": "Vision-based high-speed target-identification and tracking is a critical application in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with wide military and commercial usage. Traditional frame cameras processed through convolutional neural networks (CNN) exhibit high target-identification accuracy but with low throughput (hence low tracking speed) and high power. On the other hand, event cameras or dynamic vision sensors (DVS) generate a stream of binary asynchronous events corresponding to the changing intensity of the pixels capturing high-speed temporal information, characteristic of high-speed tracking. Such event streams with high spatial sparsity processed with bio-mimetic spiking neural networks (SNN) provide low power consumption and high throughput. However, the accuracy of object detection using such event cameras and SNNs is limited. Thus, a frame pipeline with a CNN and an event pipeline with a SNN (Fig. 29.5.1) possess complementary strengths in capturing and processing the spatial and temporal details, respectively. Hence, a hybrid network that fuses frame data processed using a CNN pipeline with event data processed through an SNN pipeline provides a platform for high-speed, high-accuracy and low-power target-identification and tracking. To address this need, we present a fully-programmable heterogeneous ARM Cortex-based SoC with an in-memory low-power RRAM-based CNN and a near-memory high-speed SRAM-based SNN in a hybrid architecture with applications in high-speed target identification and tracking."

For this reason, solar PV power generation has recently gained much attention as a feasible renewable energy source. However, large-scale generation is challenging if there are anomalies in individual solar PV panels. This will reduce the efficiency of the PV system and create a potential fire hazard. In this perspective, the anomaly detection technique discloses system anomalies accurately and effectively. Identified anomalies will localize the event for an improved generation. This paper addresses the performance analysis of using the isolation forest technique to identify anomalies in the PV system and the rule-based fault localization technique to identify defective panel events. In the developed model, the isolation forest technique found around 453 anomalies in 45,740 observations, and approximately six panels indicated a fault in the system. The accuracy score is found to be approximately 0.9886. The proposed fault detection method will help detect the faults in solar power systems."

The main issue in the agricultural sector is leaf diseases, which have an impact on crop yield and financial gain. Early detection of leaf diseases in plants is essential to prevent losses to the agricultural sector. There are several tomato leaf diseases that affect the crop’s leaves, including the Mosaic virus, Early Blight, Healthy, Septoria leaf, and Bacterial spot. Using deep learning algorithms and image processing methods, we can identify the diseases in tomato leaves using developing deep learning approaches. The implementation procedures in our proposed work involves data collection, pre-processing, training, feature extraction, testing, and classification utilising the Visual Geometry Group (VGG 16) to identify damaged or healthy leaves. VGG 16 is incorporated to categorise the leaves as healthy or diseased based on the data and Regression’s boundary box method is adopted. Therefore, using Faster RCNN, a model is created to identify and categorise diseases from every image of a tomato leaf that is used as an input, providing a forecast with a considerably greater degree of accuracy. We obtain an accuracy of approximately 98% after fitting the collected features into the neural network over 20 iterations."
