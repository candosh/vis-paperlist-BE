First, the mechatronic design of the Cubli is presented. Then the multi-body system dynamics are derived. The parameters of the nonlinear system are identified using a frequency domain based approach while the Cubli is balancing on its edge with a nominal controller. Finally, the corner balancing using a linear feedback controller is presented along with experimental results."

The particular focus lies on the emission caused by modern photovoltaic (PV) inverters. Based on laboratory measurements, the general characteristics of the emission spectrum of these inverters are discussed and a suitable evaluation method is proposed. The next part presents the results of a long term measurement campaign recording voltage distortion levels at 25 sites up to 40 kHz. Grids without PV installations show very low distortion levels. In grids with PV the level is closely linked to the location of the inverter in relation to the measurement site. In general, the lowest distortion levels were recorded at the transformer LV bus bar. The highest levels were reached at the point of connection (POC) of an inverter. At all sites no customer complaints are known due to HF voltage distortion. The last part of the paper presents a case study, where the connection of a machine with inverter technology caused HF distortion levels, which led to multiple device malfunction and noise in household appliances and subsequently to customer complaints."

Moreover, mobility results in channel gains that vary significantly with time. However, since location and received signal strength are correlated, user mobility patterns can be exploited to predict the data rates they will experience in the future. In this paper, we show that with such predictions, long-term RA plans that span multiple cells can be made. We formulate an optimal Predictive Resource Allocation (PRA) framework for a network of cells as a linear programming problem for three different objectives. Presented numerical results provide a benchmark of the PRA performance in realistic and random user mobility scenarios. Significant network and user satisfaction gains are observed compared to RA schemes that do not utilize any predictions."

This paper proposes a Synchrophasor Specific Intrusion Detection System (SSIDS) for malicious cyber attacks and unintended misuse. The SSIDS involves a heterogeneous whitelist and behaviour-based approach to detect known and unknown attacks. The paper investigates and simulates reconnaissance, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks against a practical synchrophasor system that is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SSIDS detection tool. In contrast to previous research in this area that generally has investigated known attacks, this research actively considers the operational features of the IEEE C37.118 protocol and presents a more comprehensive and general solution to deal with not only known attacks but also unknown attacks."

In content-based image retrieval systems, Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance are typically used to determine similarities between a pair of image [2]. Here facial images of three subjects with different expression and angles are used for classification. Experimental results are compared and the results show that the Manhattan distance performs better than the Euclidean Distance."

However, the existing LTE uplink scheduling algorithms can't be applied to M2M services. It is necessary and urgent to optimize the LTE uplink scheduling algorithms. In this paper, we propose a LTE uplink scheduling algorithm named M2MA-SA under massive M2M and H2H arrivals. M2MA-SA differentiates between M2M and H2H services. For massive M2M services, a compound 2-phase scheduling mechanism is presented, which combines maximum-utility scheduling with round robin scheduling. For H2H services, an algorithm named Iternative Maximum Expansion (IME) is used which satisfied the contiguity constraint of LTE uplink resource allocation. The simulation results show that M2MA-SA not only guarantees the QoS of H2H communication, but also improves the system throughput and the capacity of H2H users."

Models for the energy consumption of the RF and decoding stages are discussed and included in the design of the proposed resource allocation policies. The allocation is performed discretely over subcarrier, bit loading, and power by means of practical greedy-like algorithms and considering energy-related constraints in order to increase the duration of the batteries and, thus, the network lifetime. Simulation results show that not only the usage of battery is improved when compared with other traditional allocation policies, but also the average bit-rate is enhanced."

However, a general web application crawler that exhaustively explores the states can become mired in limited specific regions of the web application, yielding poor functionality coverage. In this paper, we propose a feedback-directed web application exploration technique to derive test models. While exploring, our approach dynamically measures and applies a combination of code coverage impact, navigational diversity, and structural diversity, to decide a-priori (1) which state should be expanded, and (2) which event should be exercised next to maximize the overall coverage, while minimizing the size of the test model. Our approach is implemented in a tool called FEEDEx. We have empirically evaluated the efficacy of FEEDEx using six web applications. The results show that our technique is successful in yielding higher coverage while reducing the size of the test model, compared to classical exhaustive techniques such as depth-first, breadth-first, and random exploration."

The direct ZBR load flow [1]is known as a fast and accurate method for solving passive radial three phase distribution systems. The Modified Lambda approach is chosen because of its simple algorithm that can be easily combined with direct ZBR method in handling DG'swhich are operated as voltage controlled(PV) buses."

In this paper, the use of various data mining methods is examined and their performance in EV load forecasting is evaluated."

In the recent time the number of reported disturbances (e.g. malfunctions of coffee machines, audible noise of electronic ballasts) caused by this emission is growing. Beside these obvious interferences the question arises, if electronic mass-market equipment is affected by this higher frequency (HF) emission as well. Especially in shunt elements with low impedance at higher frequencies, like DC-link capacitors in rectifier circuits, larger high frequency currents can occur, which may result in additional thermal stress and lifetime reduction. Based on a laboratory setup the paper analyses the impact of HF components in the supply voltage on the operating temperature within different lamps with electronic ballast. Using a laboratory setup the frequency-dependent input behaviour of different electronic equipment was measured up to 50 kHz. For selected lamps detailed temperature studies were carried out."

The algorithm employs three models a physical model, energy model and State of Charge (SoC) model. The outputs of the models are averaged using a weighted average. This approach provides redundancy and more importantly availability of the function. Methods are employed to provide the driver with an accurate initialisation range value when the ignition is switched on. This utilises past driving history data and determines an output value based on the previous drive cycle. The work describes the flow sequence of the EV range function. Results for several drive cycles are analysed and show that accurate EV range prediction is achieved using the algorithm."

Backward-facing powertrain models, which incorporate scalable powertrain components, have often been used for this purpose. However, due to their quasi-static nature, backward-facing models give very limited information about the limits of the system and drivability of the vehicle. This makes it difficult for control system development and implementation in hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test systems. This paper investigates the viability of using forward-facing models in the context of powertrain component sizing optimisation. The vehicle model used in this investigation features a conventional powertrain with an internal combustion engine, clutch, manual transmission, and final drive. Simulations that were carried out have indicated that there is minimal effect on the optimal cost with regards to variations in the driver model sensitivity. This opens up the possibility of using forward-facing models for the purpose of powertrain component sizing."

An equivalent circuit model approach was adopted with parameters dependant on temperature and state of charge (SOC). The model was parameterised at 50°C, 20°C, 0°C and -30°C and between 10% and 100% SOC. Initial parameter estimations for the model identification procedure were informed by EIS. The model was validated (at constant SOC), for the entire temperature range and at C-rates between C/2 and 9C, by voltage simulation based on a dynamic drive cycle profile. Maximal residuals did not exceed 68 mV or 2% of the nominal cell voltage (Vnom) and root-mean-squared deviations remained within 28 mV or 0.8% of Vnom at all temperatures and C-rates."

According to the geometric relationship among these channels, this paper analyzes the impulse response function of arbitrary elevation channel, and derives its explicit expression. Based upon this, an improved DBF processing scheme, which combines the time-variant weighting and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering, is presented. Additionally, the block diagram of this DBF configuration is given. Compared with other echo-receiving methods, this approach can maximize the receive gain and optimize the system performance for the case of long pulse, without much increase of the system complexity. Simulation results indicate that it enables the system to achieve its theoretically optimal receiving performance."

Voltage impacts are measured using EN50160 and the thermal capabilities are examined through a utilisation factor. Additionally, the effects of higher LV busbar voltages are also investigated. Results indicate that voltage issues are more constraining than asset utilisation, particularly with clusters closer to the transformer."

In a Microgrid (MG), which comprises of intermittent Distributed Generators (DGs) (eg. solar and wind energy sources), the need of Demand Side Management (DSM)/ Demand Response (DR) becomes significant. The key point in DSM is to shift the load to some other point in time, this causes inconvenience to the customer and therefore it should be minimized. Minimizing the cost of generation and also minimizing the inconvenience caused due to shifting of loads is a multiobjective optimization problem. In this work the authors consider an industrial/ commercial MG with one solar source, two diesel generators and one battery, with the assumption that the utility grid uses dynamic pricing. The objective function contains discontinuous functions which will be difficult to solve using conventional optimization techniques and hence a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based solution is proposed. The simulation results show that there is savings for the customer with DSM compared to the case without DSM."

Hence, a self-sustaining monitoring and control system for LV-grids has been developed. It monitors the power flow situation and is able to control the grid if necessary.

The conventional distribution grid was not designed for the integration of DGs. Hence the integration of DGs into the distribution grid presents a few challenges to the operation of distribution network. This paper addresses some of these challenges and uses the concept of reconfiguration as a solution to meet these challenges. By reconfiguration, the maximum voltage at each node of the test network was kept within limits, thus mitigating the over voltage problem due to increased DG penetration. Since the reduction in number of switchings due to reconfiguration will help reduce the operation cost, this paper incorporates the objective of minimizing switching as well. The number of switchings could be reduced from six to two for the test network under consideration. Also it has been shown in this paper that reconfiguration can help in deferring the investment required in a transformer like adding on load tap changer."

The proposed technique consists of the coordinated action of on-load tap changer (OLTC) of transformer and reactive power compensation by D-STATCOM. Managing the system voltage using the action of OLTC is one of the most common ways for voltage regulation of MV systems. However, OLTC cannot be used for voltage regulation of long radial distribution feeders as it changes the sending point voltage of the feeder. In this study, the problem of using OLTC for the voltage regulation of a radial distribution feeder will be solved by using reactive power compensation at the DG connected bus. Simulation results reveal that the proposed control method is capable of maintaining the system voltage within the permitted range in the worst scenarios of the test system."

This paper presents a novel data-based phase bias estimation method in time-domain. Firstly, the echoes in time-domain received by the adjacent channels are processed to get interferometric phases, which consist of the Doppler centroid information and the difference of the phase biases between the adjacent channels. Then, the Doppler centroid can be extracted by circular integral of the adjacent interferometric phases. Finally, the phase bias between each channel and the reference one can be obtained by integral of the interferometric phase subtracted by the phase of the Doppler centroid. Using the presented method, both the phase bias and the Doppler centroid of the raw echoes can be effectively estimated. The performance of presented method is validated by the experiments of simulated spaceborne multi-channel SAR data."

Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) has proven to be a very promising solution to cope with this issue. However, few experiments so far have addressed ampacity forecasting, which is critical to allow the integration of DLR in the electricity market processes. To tackle this gap, we developed an algorithm based on real-time DLR measurements and weather forecasts, which provides ampacity forecasts up to two days ahead. This paper describes the results of the EU-funded TWENTIES Demo led in Belgium on two 150kV lines. Currently, the DLR system used provides a two-day ahead ampacity forecast with more than 10% average gain over static rating (dynamic gain forecast varying roughly between 0% and 30%) with 98% confidence. Operational gains allowed by this increase of flexibility are still being assessed."

Advanced decision support tools can help network planners to select among the numerous alternatives for the optimal future distribution network layout and expansion schedule. This in contrast to the existing method, whereas the generation of planning alternatives is carried out heuristically by network planners based on design directives and experience. Advanced decision support tools require the most efficient optimization techniques, must be able to find the optimal investment path considering multiple scenarios, and should not only consider classic expansion strategies but also intelligent ones (e.g. energy storage and controlling active demand). Advanced decision support tools would greatly help network operators to make better decisions under uncertainty, which contributes to an affordable, sustainable, and reliable electric energy supply."

An important conclusion from the study is that current amplification can occur due to harmonic resonances between different types of filters."

More than 900MW of photovoltaic (PV) plants were connected to this distribution grid. It was detected the problem with overvoltage in approximately 20% low voltage distribution grids with connected PV plants and this problem has to be solved. The problem with high voltage variance is caused partially due to the operation of PV plants connected into the MV distribution grid and partially due to the operation of PV plants connected into the LV distribution grid. It is supposable, that the problem with overvoltage will occur when PV plants are connected both into the MV and into the LV distribution grid in the same part of the grid. In order to cope with the increased level of distributed generation new solutions for grid operation and new technologies are needed. In the paper are described three solutions for voltage stabilization. These proposed solutions prevent nonconforming voltage quality (overvoltage) according to the EN 50160 standard and following investments."

Because the prediction accuracy for solar radiation is the first key problem for the PV power prediction, a solar radiation prediction method based on support vector machine (SVM) with similar data was proposed in the paper. Similar data was extracted from historical data by using pattern recognition with Euclidean distance to create the training samples. Employing to wavelet decomposition, the original solar radiation signal was decomposed into trend signal of low frequency band and random signal of high frequency band. Different SVM radiation prediction models were trained respectively and combined to obtain the final forecasting results. The simulation results show that similar data enhance the relevance of the data and improve the model prediction accuracy Wavelet decomposition reduces the non-stationary parts of solar radiation signals. Different SVM models better approximate the solar radiation characteristics of low and high frequency band and good prediction accuracy is obtained."

A balanced distribution grid results in improved voltage profiles, a lower voltage unbalance and lower losses. The first method discusses the changing of the phase connection of single-phase customers. Optimization techniques with a constrained maximum number of changes show that this passive solution may be suitable for unbalanced grids. Secondly the effect of balancing three-phase PV-inverters is investigated. The proposed control consists of injecting the majority of the produced power in the phase with the highest power consumption, based only on local voltage information. Both methods are evaluated with extensive load flow simulations with real data."

Through the current expansion of integrating DG units in low voltage networks, the network operation is becoming more complex than before. However, real-time monitoring and control through state estimation is a routine task for the transmission system operators (TSO's) due to the availability of measurement data. The distribution system operators (DSO's) are trying to extend their monitoring and control for medium and low voltage network in order to enable smart grid applications. With the current rollout of smart meters, which are considered as a key component of future smart grids, there would be enough metering data in the distribution networks (voltage, current, active and reactive power consumption and generation) available at every customer connection point. This paper aims to develop a method to solve the problem of meter placement for low voltage system state estimation through deciding which measurement data from the installed smart meters should be considered in the state estimation algorithms in order to improve on the uncertainty of the estimated voltage and its phase angle at every node in the network."

Laboratory testing has been performed to improve the understanding of the high frequency system interaction between vacuum circuit breaker, transformer, and cables. A dry type medium voltage transformer has been energized and disconnected in a 20 kV medium voltage laboratory cable system using a vacuum circuit breaker. The transformer is a standard transformer, equipped with additional voltage measuring taps along the disks of one of the high-voltage windings, enabling the measurement of the voltages in the winding when exposed to transient overvoltages. The results show that normal no-load energizing and disconnection of the transformer do not cause any high overvoltages. Disconnection of the transformer with an inductive load or a trip on inrush current during energizing can cause transient overvoltages. Surge arresters, both phases to ground and phase to phase, are recommended for a transformer exposed to these types of circuit breaker operations."

Emission up to 25 kHz will be presented as well as voltage variations caused by the production. Measurements from three phase connected plants (20 kW) and from smaller (up to 2.5 kW) single phase connected plants are shown. The harmonic emission from PV-plants is reasonable low and somewhat constant with regards to the production. Some residue from the switching of the inverter can be found typical at a few kHz."

To date, the investigations on CS based MUD have omitted the channel estimation and assumed perfect channel knowledge. However, in practical applications the channel also has to be estimated, such that the joint detection of activity and data has to be extended by channel estimation. Therefore, in this paper we investigate how to adapt several approaches to channel estimation, such that they are suitable for this joint detection and estimation. Further, we provide simulation results, showing that low overhead channel estimation can be achieved, with only a small loss in detection accuracy compared to CS based MUD for perfect channel state information."

The ANNs are trained to estimate the fault distance to the substation (FDANN).The Inputs of the ANNs are data of 3 phase voltages, currents and active powers of the feeder are measured at the substation in pre-fault and fault stages. The proposed method does not need data of loads of consumers. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 34-bus test feeder. Each ANN is trained by operating patterns. In order for ANNs cover the total operating space of the radial distribution network; fault location, fault resistance and loads are changed in each pattern. The outputs of ANNs for the operating test patterns, not presented in the training stage, are shown the accuracy of the ANNs. The trained FDANNs can estimate fault distance to the substation; even the structure of the distribution network is changed. Proposed method is effective while the input data are contained errors of measuring."

The problem is posed as an optimization problem with an objective to maximize the loss reduction and improve the voltage profile. The optimization procedure is subject to some technical (maximum permissible branch current, maximum and minimum voltage limits and maximum permissible size of capacitors) and operational constraints (load connectivity and radial network structure). The proposed algorithm has been implemented and tested on two test systems from the literatures. The results obtained using the proposed algorithm are compared with the results obtained using different methods given in literature. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

It exhibits considerably different traffic patterns than human-type communication, thus, claims for new traffic models and simulation scenarios. The challenge in designing such models is not only to accurately capture the behavior of single MTC devices but also to handle their enormous amount (e.g., up to 30 000 devices per cell) and their coordinated behavior. Source traffic models (i.e., each device is modeled as autonomous entity) are generally desirable for their precision and flexibility. However, their complexity is in general growing quadratically with the number of devices. Aggregated traffic models (i.e., all device are summarized to one stream) are far less precise but their complexity is mainly independent of the number of devices. In this work we propose an approach which is combining the advantages of both modeling paradigms, namely, the Coupled Markov Modulated Poisson Processes (CMMPP) framework. It demonstrates the feasibility of source traffic modeling for MTC, being enabled by only linearly growing complexity. Compared to aggregated MTC traffic models, such as proposed by 3GPP TR37.868, CMMPP allows for enhanced accuracy and flexibility at the cost of moderate computational complexity."

A new method of analyzing and calculating fault current of DFIG is presented, which combines the advantages of physical process analysis and frequency domain analysis. According to the physical process analysis, the frequency domain equation of DFIG is divided into several equations about zero state and zero input response. By separately solving the several equations, formulas for calculation of the fault current are deduced. These formulas are not only applicable to calculation of short circuit current under symmetrical fault but also unsymmetrical fault. Based on this method, the fault current characteristics of DFIG under symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault are compared. Comparison result shows that AC component of fault current of DFIG under symmetrical fault soon decays end. But AC component under unsymmetrical fault is stable at the end. These new characteristics have an effect on the applicability of the traditional relay protection, and provide a theoretical basis for new methods of relay protection. At the end, simulation results show validity of the proposed formulas under symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault."

A spectrum of enabling technologies such as Demand Side Response (DSR) and Energy Storage (ES) can be used to provide distribution network support services, for example voltage and load flow control. In this paper, a methodology for assessing the potential benefits of using ES and DSR to postpone reinforcements of the existing network assets is presented. The methodology is based on a nonlinear multi-period optimal power flow (OPF), where DSR and ES are modelled as a part of the optimisation constraints. DSR is built on a shifting algorithm applied to wet appliances. Storage model optimizes size and location of the ES. The approach is tested on a 11kV distribution network. The obtained results show that DSR and ES may be used for network assets investments deferral, thus more efficiently using the existing network capacity."

        "abstract": "Onshore wind farms can now be regarded as a mature technology, capable of providing increasing levels of clean energy. The development of offshore wind technology will provide the ability to harness much larger wind energy resource. Offshore wind arrays present many new challenges including the electrical power system which provides the internal collection system and the connection to the on-shore power network. For remote offshore wind farms, high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission will be required to transmit power from the wind farm to the shore. The use of HVDC has the effect of decoupling the wind farms internal collection network from the rest of the power grid, thereby removing the requirement for a conventional alternating current (AC) network. This paper discusses the use of a direct current (DC) collection system for offshore wind farms, with particulars emphasis of DC-DC converter requirements. The proposed converter is validated by the simulation model and the performances e.g. switching losses, conduction losses are investigated."

This paper investigates modelling the temperature dependence of equivalent circuit parameters. Experiments have been performed on an induction machine to characterise its impedance response (up to 10 MHz) over the temperature range (22.4-210) oC. Using these measurements non-linear parameter estimation is performed using the Nelder-Mead method to derive temperature-dependent models, with an average absolute magnitude error of 270 Ω. The accuracy has been evaluated over the frequency range for the different temperatures and highlights where improvements are needed. This work has important applications in electric machine design and condition monitoring. Also it provides a valuable precursor towards developing age-dependent models for traction based applications."

Assuming a nonnegative hierarchical closure structure (a Galois lattice) ensures the data has a unique ordered overcomplete dictionary representation. Parts-based constraints on these closures can then be used to specify and supervise the form of the solution. We illustrate that this approach outperforms NMF on two standard NMF datasets: it exhibits the properties described above; It is correct and exact."

The assessment is based on results from Danish failure statistics. It is concluded that there are no significant signs of an increasing failure rate for dry-cured XLPE cables after a service time of a least 30 years. It is also shown that a large part of the failures take place while the system is operated at elevated phase-to-earth voltage on sound phases due to an earth fault somewhere in the system. An analysis also shows that the systems often are operated with an earth fault in 30 minutes or more before the XLPE cable failure occurs, which is interesting when comparing to recommended test duration for power frequency testing of MV cables."

In this paper calculation and analysis of distribution losses is fulfilled in a commercial section in Mashhad. Two methods are introduced, utilized and compared for power loss calculations: \"Field measurement\" and \"Simulation study\". Afterward some techniques are utilized to minimize technical and non-technical power loss of the studied section. Technical loss is minimized by complete removal of low voltage network and non-technical loss is minimized by Implementation of AMI system. Finally the results of power loss reduction indicate proper planning of this project."

That is why a new insulating composition, based on modified vegetable oil, has been developed to present very similar properties to those of the standard insulating mineral oils and to meet the specific needs of current distribution transformers. This article presents the formulation of this low-viscosity ester fluid, and it reports the results of the tests carried out to assess its performance in laboratory and real conditions."

Only when both security of VANET and transportation are guaranteed, civil life and property security are surely defended. After highlighting the urgency and complicacy in solving the VANET security concern by the system, we confirm that security system architecture serves as a protective shield against overall threats. Targeted at all risks and challenges VANET is confronted with, this article summarizes existing security system architecture for the time being, sorted generalizes current architectures according to backstop technologies and specifies characteristics and technical issues in separate security system architecture respectively based on PKI, ID and situation modelling. The hierarchical framework of VANET Security System Architecture is significantly stressed on, as the whole secure background in VANET relies on bilateral coordination of self-accomplishment in each hierarchy and mutual support for one another. Core technology applicable in each hierarchy for VANET is identified and future breach for relevant research is exposed."

        "abstract": "Power consumption is a critical issue in Wireless Sensor Networks(WSN) applications and typically the energy consumed by the wireless communication dominates. Reducing the WSN node activity and the communication energy can extend the lifetime of the node considerably. This work presents a direct application approach to extend the lifetime of a wireless senor node using a MEMS piezoelectric energy harvesting device in combination with a nano-Watt wake-up radio receiver, in order to build an efficient power device. The design of the power device will be connected to each node as a normal battery bringing the wake-up radio capabilities. Two scenarios were implemented to use the power unit as a wireless switch with harvesters, or to use the power management wake up polices while the MEMS piezoelectric harvester was designed as a power supply directly to the wake up radio receiver. The experimental results and characterization of the muW-MEMS harvester are presented. Finally, measurements on a generic node present the benefits of this approach bringing the power consumption in low power mode down to nano-Watt level (zero power) when the node is not needed in the application."

While the daily output of distributed generators (DGs) strongly depends on the temporal distribution of natural resources such as wind and solar, unregulated electric vehicle (EV) charging demand will reduce the imbalance between the daily load and generation curves. In this paper, a statistical model is presented to describe daily EV charging/discharging behaviour. An optimisation problem is proposed and verified to obtain economic operation for the micro-grid based on this model. In day-ahead scheduling, with estimated information of power generation and load demand, optimal charging/discharging of EVs during 24 hours is obtained. A series of numerical optimisation solutions, in different scenarios, is achieved by serial quadratic programming. The results show that with optimal charging/discharging of EVs network losses can be decreased."

Nonetheless, this form of power generation needs more advancement to retrieve optimal power flow under economical conditions. This paper aims to predict optimal sizing for hybrid wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation under minimized cost. This optimal sizing of hybrid Wind-PV is accomplished by satisfying the average annual load demand. This process happens via opposition based genetic algorithm with Cauchy mutation (OGA-CM) and the proposed OGA-CM performance measure is compared with Opposition based Genetic Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm. The result shows that our proposed OGA-GA produces superior result than those of the other two. The overall computation process is done in the working platform of MATLAB R2013."

The grounding system initially designed for uniform soil, may become two layer or multilayer soil structure due to seasonal variation such as rainy, early spring and winter season. The formation of low or high resistivity soil layers leads to change grounding grid resistance and affects the most stringent safety criterion like step and touch voltages on the ground surface. The grounding system is extensively analysed for various seasons like raining and freezing in winter considering two layer soil model due to formation of low or high resistivity soil layers. Moreover, safety is analysed using multilayer soil model for some cases. The study reveals that the grounding grid designed for uniform soil may becomes unsafe during freezing and early spring. Therefore, grounding system must be designed very carefully. Use of long vertical ground rods can effectively attenuates the seasonal influence and improves the safety of grounding system. The simulation has been carried out by using Autogrid-Pro grounding software of SES & technology, Canada."

In this paper, we present Priority based Genetic Algorithm BCHGA to schedule workflow applications to cloud resources that optimize the total cost of workflow within the user`s specified budget. Each workflow`s task is assigned priority using bottom level (b-level) and top level (t-level). To increase the population diversity, these priorities are then used to create the initial population of BCHGA. The proposed algorithm is simulated in java and evaluated with synthetic workflows based on realistic workflows from the different areas by considering the pricing model of cloud service provider like Amazon. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has a promising performance as compared to Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA)."

        "abstract": "In this study, crimping factors that have possibilities to affect the contact resistance of medium voltage cable ferrule and lug had been determined and further verified in laboratory experiments. A good crimping is important in order to achieve a very good contact resistance for cable joint (Below 50micro-Ohms). Other than that, good contact resistance between cables joint can reduce the chance of having hotspots that are commonly caused by overheating in cable joint. It was found in most situations that the measurement of contact resistance at site is not possible due to insufficient access to make a measurement. Most of cable failure cases were caused by failure of cable joints. Hence, a better crimping or cable connection method is needed to ensure a good contact in every cable joint. There are few crimping factors that have been pondered in this study and the factors are; (1) Crimping pressure, (2) Number of crimp indents, (3) Location of crimp indents, and (4) Shape of crimp indents. Twenty eight different configuration of compression connectors and bolted connectors for 240 mm2 stranded aluminium cable conductors have been examined in order to identify and clarify the correlations between the designs characteristics, applied pressure, configurations, crimp numbers and other possible parameters to the quality of the connection of ferrule and lug. The quality is assessed with the basis in contact resistance measurement and tensile strength after sample preparation. The results showed that applied pressure does not necessarily contributed to increase of contact resistance, but configuration and crimp numbers does. These results also showed that deep indent crimp is better than hexagonal crimp for 240 mm2 stranded aluminium cable conductors and how different deep indent crimp in terms of quality compared to the inc"

An EV, with its limited charging point infrastructure and long charge times, is not seen as being as reliable as a conventional car in this respect. To make EVs more acceptable, forward-looking predictive methods of calculating range need to be developed which also take into account opportunities to conserve or harvest energy, as well as environmental factors such as terrain and weather conditions. Using a well-established EV range simulator, this paper describes scenarios showing the limitations of relying on such an approach and the potential detrimental results to both the driver and vehicle's ability to start and complete a journey. It provides an overview of the research being undertaken by the authors to address these problems, including a description of `Electrikitty', a road legal pure EV that will be used to gather data to verify the development of novel range estimation algorithms."

Since the entire conventional transistor have junction, which limits it's scaling as it requires very abrupt junction, high concentration gradient and become challenging with every technology node. The problems comes when there is a junction in such a device like MOSFETs which has source junction and drain junction formed with oppositely doped substrate. A junctionless transistor is a uniformly doped nanowire without junction and no doping concentration gradient exist. It shows better short channel effect and less degradation in mobility with temperature, small DIBL, subthreshold swing and higher voltage gain which shows good scalability below 10nm and reduces the fabrication complexity. Junctionless transistor is a very promising candidate for future nano scale MOSFET device."

Frequency sampling of SFCW utilizes IDFT to realize range compression without match filtering, which simplifies the imaging algorithm, lowers the sampling rate of AD converter and reduces the data size in imaging. A simulation of SFCW range compression is conducted and the result is consistent with the analysis of SFCW's imaging performance. Finally, an experiment is presented and the result verifies the imaging ability of SFCWGBSAR."

Its protection regarding safety and security threats is increasing awareness and concern. The fact that this infrastructure is geographically spread across large areas brings difficult technological challenges for fault management (real-time prevention, detection, precise location and isolation of anomalies). The distribution automation and fault location in the distribution network is a key task for any operator. Distribution Automation (DA) and electric network monitoring and sensing can reduce outage and repair times, optimise voltage profiles and improve asset management. Advanced DA processes real-time information from sensors, smart meters, Distributed Generation (DG) and network topology for fault location, automatic reconfiguration of feeders, voltage and reactive power optimisation. This paper addresses this subject and describes the technology and functionalities being implemented on a DA pilot project promoted by EDP Distribuição (EDP Group), Portugal and under InovGrid initiative together with Efface and Silver Spring Networks (SSN)."

Different control methods for emulating inertial response to reduce both the rate of change of frequency and frequency nadir are proposed for variable speed turbines. The energy storage is used to smooth the transition of the wind turbines rotor from deceleration to acceleration after inertial response. Matlab/Simulink simulations based on a simple power system have demonstrated the frequency support effect of the proposed methods."

The estimation of the HIF location is carried out by using an artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN inputs are both three phase currents and its energy of the Wavelet Coefficients obtained during the HIF. The Wavelet mother function used was Daubechies 48. The ANN was trained and the performance of the proposed HIF location was evaluated by using a HIF modeled with two series time-varying resistances controlled by the Transient Analysis of Control Systems (TACS) of the Alternative Transient Program (ATP). Actual data obtained from several staged HIFs in different soil types on Energisa utility (a Brazilian distribution system) were used to adjust the HIF model."

The lack of timely access to information within domains of the smart grid serves as a real limit to detect and effectively react to system instability. Therefore, the delays are an important aspect and should be considered into any power system design or analysis. In this paper, we propose an IP/MPLS based communication infrastructure and optical fiber for the communication medium in the backbone network. In addition, in order to achieve the quality of service required for smart grid applications, traffic flows are classification into four classes using prioritize traffic and appropriate assignment of code point. Then, by using the Traffic Engineering with Diffserv (DS-TE) and active queue management algorithms as well as RIO, the quality of service is guaranteed in an acceptable level."

        "abstract": "MANETs are more susceptible to the security attacks because of the properties such as node mobility, lack of centralized management and limited band width. To reduce the risks of these attacks, various security mechanisms such as encryption and authentication have been proposed. But as we cannot completely eliminate such risks there is a strong need for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). So, in this paper we propose a neural network method based on MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) for detecting normal and attacked behaviour of the system. The method was tested for black hole and gray hole attacks. We have implemented these attacks using NS2 simulator. The method successfully detected these attacks. This paper presents a graphical representation of the results."
