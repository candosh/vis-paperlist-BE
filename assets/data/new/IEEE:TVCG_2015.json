        "abstract": "We present a perceptually calibrated system for automatic aesthetic evaluation of photographic images. Our work builds upon the concepts of no-reference image quality assessment, with the main difference being our focus on rating image aesthetic attributes rather than detecting image distortions. In contrast to the recent attempts on the highly subjective aesthetic judgment problems such as binary aesthetic classification and the prediction of an image's overall aesthetics rating, our method aims on providing a reliable objective basis of comparison between aesthetic properties of different photographs. To that end our system computes perceptually calibrated ratings for a set of fundamental and meaningful aesthetic attributes, that together form an “aesthetic signature” of an image. We show that aesthetic signatures can still be used to improve upon the current state-of-the-art in automatic aesthetic judgment, but also enable interesting new photo editing applications such as automated aesthetic analysis, HDR tone mapping evaluation, and providing aesthetic feedback during multi-scale contrast manipulation."

        "abstract": "Most mesh denoising techniques utilize only either the facet normal field or the vertex normal field of a mesh surface. The two normal fields, though contain some redundant geometry information of the same model, can provide additional information that the other field lacks. Thus, considering only one normal field is likely to overlook some geometric features. In this paper, we take advantage of the piecewise consistent property of the two normal fields and propose an effective framework in which they are filtered and integrated using a novel method to guide the denoising process. Our key observation is that, decomposing the inconsistent field at challenging regions into multiple piecewise consistent fields makes the two fields complementary to each other and produces better results. Our approach consists of three steps: vertex classification, bi-normal filtering, and vertex position update. The classification step allows us to filter the two fields on a piecewise smooth surface rather than a surface that is smooth everywhere. Based on the piecewise consistence of the two normal fields, we filtered them using a piecewise smooth region clustering strategy. To benefit from the bi-normal filtering, we design a quadratic optimization algorithm for vertex position update. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our algorithm achieves higher quality results than current approaches on surfaces with multifarious geometric features and irregular surface sampling."

        "abstract": "GPS, RFID, and other technologies have made it increasingly common to track the positions of people and objects over time as they move through two-dimensional spaces. Visualizing such spatio-temporal movement data is challenging because each person or object involves three variables (two spatial variables as a function of the time variable), and simply plotting the data on a 2D geographic map can result in overplotting and occlusion that hides details. This also makes it difficult to understand correlations between space and time. Software such as GeoTime can display such data with a three-dimensional visualization, where the 3rd dimension is used for time. This allows for the disambiguation of spatially overlapping trajectories, and in theory, should make the data clearer. However, previous experimental comparisons of 2D and 3D visualizations have so far found little advantage in 3D visualizations, possibly due to the increased complexity of navigating and understanding a 3D view. We present a new controlled experimental comparison of 2D and 3D visualizations, involving commonly performed tasks that have not been tested before, and find advantages in 3D visualizations for more complex tasks. In particular, we tease out the effects of various basic interactions and find that the 2D view relies significantly on “scrubbing” the timeline, whereas the 3D view relies mainly on 3D camera navigation. Our work helps to improve understanding of 2D and 3D visualizations of spatio-temporal data, particularly with respect to interactivity."

Some of these issues can best be handled by methods that support users' control over the classification steps. In this paper, we propose a visual data classification methodology that supports users in tasks related to categorization such as training set selection; model creation, application and verification; and classifier tuning. The approach is then well suited for incremental classification, present in many applications with evolving data sets. Data set visualization is accomplished by means of point placement strategies, and we exemplify the method through multidimensional projections and Neighbor Joining trees. The same methodology can be employed by a user who wishes to create his or her own ground truth (or perspective) from a previously unlabeled data set. We validate the methodology through its application to categorization scenarios of image and text data sets, involving the creation, application, verification, and adjustment of classification models."

        "abstract": "Similarity-based layouts generated by multidimensional projections or other dimension reduction techniques are commonly used to visualize high-dimensional data. Many projection techniques have been recently proposed addressing different objectives and application domains. Nonetheless, very little is known about the effectiveness of the generated layouts from a user's perspective, how distinct layouts from the same data compare regarding the typical visualization tasks they support, or how domain-specific issues affect the outcome of the techniques. Learning more about projection usage is an important step towards both consolidating their role in high-dimensional data analysis and taking informed decisions when choosing techniques. This work provides a contribution towards this goal. We describe the results of an investigation on the performance of layouts generated by projection techniques as perceived by their users. We conducted a controlled user study to test against the following hypotheses: (1) projection performance is task-dependent; (2) certain projections perform better on certain types of tasks; (3) projection performance depends on the nature of the data; and (4) subjects prefer projections with good segregation capability. We generated layouts of high-dimensional data with five techniques representative of different projection approaches. As application domains we investigated image and document data. We identified eight typical tasks, three of them related to segregation capability of the projection, three related to projection precision, and two related to incurred visual cluttering. Answers to questions were compared for correctness against `ground truth' computed directly from the data. We also looked at subject confidence and task completion times. Statistical analysis of the collected data resulted in Hypotheses 1 and 3 being confirmed, Hypothesis 2 being confirmed partially and Hypotheses 4 could not be confirmed. We discuss our findings in comparison with some numerical measures of projection layout quality. Our results offer interesting insight on the use of projection layouts in data visualization tasks and provide a departing point for further systematic investigations."

We investigate PH meshes to understand how the shape, size, and pattern of PH faces are constrained by surface geometry. This understanding enables us to develop an effective method for paneling freeform architectural surfaces with PH meshes. Our method first constructs an ideal triangulation of a given smooth surface, guided by surface geometry. We show that such an ideal triangulation leads to a Dupin-regular PH mesh via tangent duality on the surface. We have developed several novel and effective techniques for improving undesirable mesh layouts caused by singular behaviors of surface curvature. We compute support structures associated with PH meshes, including exact vertex offsets and approximate edge offsets, as demanded in panel manufacturing. The efficacy of our method is validated by a number of architectural examples."

        "abstract": "Particle tracing in time-varying flow fields is traditionally performed by numerical integration of the underlying vector field. This procedure can become computationally expensive, especially in scattered, particle-based flow fields, which complicate interpolation due to the lack of an explicit neighborhood structure. If such a particle-based flow field allows for the identification of consecutive particle positions, an alternative approach to particle tracing can be employed: we substitute repeated numerical integration of vector data by geometric interpolation in the highly dynamic particle system as defined by the particle-based simulation. To allow for efficient and accurate location and interpolation of changing particle neighborhoods, we develop a modified k-d tree representation that is capable of creating a dynamic partitioning of even highly compressible data sets with strongly varying particle densities. With this representation we are able to efficiently perform pathline computation by identifying, tracking, and updating an enclosing, dynamic particle neighborhood as particles move overtime. We investigate and evaluate the complexity, accuracy, and robustness of this interpolation-based alternative approach to trajectory generation in compressible and incompressible particle systems generated by simulation techniques such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)."

The core of the proposed method builds upon a patch-based optimization framework with two key contributions: First, we introduce a depth-dependent patch-pair similarity measure for distinguishing and better utilizing image contents with different depth structures. Second, a joint patch-pair search is proposed for properly handling the correlation between two views. The proposed method successfully overcomes two main challenges of editing stereoscopic 3D media: (1) maintaining the depth interpretation, and (2) providing controllability of the scene depth. The method offers patch-based solutions to a wide variety of stereoscopic image editing problems, including depth-guided texture synthesis, stereoscopic NPR, paint by depth, content adaptation, and 2D to 3D conversion. Several challenging cases are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of user studies also show that the proposed method produces stereoscopic images with good stereoscopics and visual quality."

Multiple additional attributes characterizing the movement and its environment are often also included making the level of complexity even higher. Simplification of trajectories can improve the visibility of relevant information by reducing less relevant details while maintaining important movement patterns. We propose a systematic stepwise methodology for simplifying and thematically enhancing trajectories in order to support their visual analysis. The methodology is applied iteratively and is composed of: (a) a simplification step applied to reduce the morphological complexity of the trajectories, (b) a thematic enhancement step which aims at accentuating patterns of movement, and (c) the representation and interactive exploration of the results in order to make interpretations of the findings and further refinement to the simplification and enhancement process. We illustrate our methodology through an analysis example of two different types of tracks, aircraft and pedestrian movement."

We focus on motion planning between two distant postures where linear interpolation leads to penetrations. Our framework has two stages. The motion planning problem is first solved as a Boundary Value Problem (BVP) on an energy graph which encodes penetrations, motion smoothness and user control. Having established a mapping from the configuration space to the energy graph, a fast and robust local motion planning algorithm is introduced to solve the BVP to generate motions that could only previously be computed by global planning methods. In the second stage, a projection of the solution motion onto a constraint manifold is proposed for more user control. Our method can be integrated into current keyframing techniques. It also has potential applications in motion planning problems in robotics."
