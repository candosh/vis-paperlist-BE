Numerical procedures are developed to find a converter's system-limited response time and to give insight into the nature of switch solution sets. The paper reviews known sliding surfaces in the context of control objectives. Two different objective-specific surfaces are presented: one controls peak startup current and another recovers from any disturbance with one commutation"

The state of the art in automatic speech recognition has reached the point that searching for and extracting information from large speech repositories or streaming audio has become a growing reality. This paper summarizes the technologies that have been instrumental in making audio as searchable as text, including speech recognition, speaker clustering, segmentation, and identification; topic classification; and story segmentation. Once speech is turned into text, information extraction methods can then be applied, such as named entity extraction, finding relationships between named entities, and resolution of anaphoric references. Examples of deployed systems for information extraction from speech, which incorporate some of the aforementioned technologies, will be given."

Like linear programming, we have a fairly complete duality theory, and very effective numerical methods for these problem classes; in addition, recently developed software tools considerably reduce the effort of specifying and solving convex optimization problems. There is a steadily expanding list of new applications of convex optimization, in areas such as circuit design, signal processing, statistics, machine learning, communications, control, finance, and other fields. Convex optimization is also emerging as an important tool for hard, non-convex problems, where it can be used to generate lower bounds on the optimal value, and as a heuristic method for generating suboptimal points."

Results from the measured radiated and conducted emissions are analysed in the frequency bands of 1–30MHz. These results show that the radiated field strength declines as the distance from a radiating source increases. Moreover, radiated field strength from a PLC network could be greater at places far away from the areas that benefit from the data. It is also shown that measured emissions do not meet all the specified limits."

We considered the most important task for firefighters is to understand the inside situation of the dense smoke space. Therefore, we aim to develop a system visualizing the situation of the space. First, we scanned target space by using millimeter-wave radar combined with a gyro sensor. Then, due to detect humans and objects, we construct a 3D map from signal-reflection datasets using 3D image processing techniques. In this paper, we introduce our system and report the results of the measurement experiment in the real smoke space situation."

The ADP method provides optimal reconfiguration to achieve minimum real power losses in the network. It is also used to solve the UC problem as a two-stage optimization problem whereby one stage searches for the optimal solution and the other stage evaluates the objective function of the UC problem. The performance of the proposed schemes developed to highlight new optimization applications to power system operation and management challenges was tested on small-scale power system networks"

In this strategy, the length of queue is regarded as the control object and the length of queue on the contiguous phase is used to determine the timing plan. The simulation research and actual application show that this new control strategy is more near to the manned decision process and can perform the multi-phase signal traffic control of a single intersection more effectively than the fixed-time plan. The application result is satisfied"

This algorithm adopts distance transform to turn the position information of pixels to grey level information, and then adopts the watershed algorithm to realize the search and segmentation of the adhesion border of cell. The main characteristic of this method is that it can reduce the requisition of the quality of image, such as grey difference or noise level and so on. At the same time, it can calculate fast with high accuracy and steady result. So it is suitable for most overlapped cell images segmentation"

        "abstract": "Modern FPGAs are not just able to trade off speed and area, but features, cost, static power, dynamic power, reliability and yield. This talk will discuss methodologies, metrics and success criteria for evaluation of FPGA architectural decisions. We will outline the current industrial approach to evaluating an architectural feature, and describe some of the challenges that are currently being faced for commercial architectures using some recent advances in FPGA architecture design as examples."
