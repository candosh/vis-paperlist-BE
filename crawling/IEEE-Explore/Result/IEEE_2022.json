        "abstract": "Fully polarimetric 3D-ISAR helps to achieve better three-dimensional reconstruction with respect to the single polarization 3D-ISAR approach. This is useful to obtain more populated point clouds and to improve the estimation of the interferometric phases of the scattering centres that belong to the target. A more reliable reconstruction improves the performance of ATR (Automatic Target Recognition) algorithms. The whole process relies upon the scattering centres extraction procedure, through which the complex amplitudes of the scatterers are estimated. By using polarimetry within this iterative procedure, better results can be obtained. More than one approach is available in the literature: the Polarimetric CLEAN searches for the channel where the brightest scatterer has the highest power, while the Modified Polarimetric CLEAN arranges the data (iteration by iteration) in a subspace where either the SNR is maximum or the interference is minimum.We analyzed the performance of the two techniques in terms of accuracy of polarimetric features estimation by using a simulated target. The results suggest that the Polarimetric CLEAN already performs remarkably well, but there is still space for improvement, and the Modified Polarimetric CLEAN can actually achieve better results.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. The supercomputer “Fugaku” is an exascale system, which is operated since March 2021 in R-CCS, Japan. Fugaku is an ultra-scale “general-purpose” manycore-based system with 158,976 nodes, 7.6M cores in total. We developed a new manycore processor, A64FX, designed for Fugaku, well as a system including interconnect and a storage subsystem with the industry partner, Fujitsu. A64FX supports Arm instruction sets with Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) SIMD instruction sets and is equipped with HBM2 memory. Since 2014 we have been carrying out a national project named as the FLAGSHIP 2020 Project to develop “Fugaku” system with a variety of scientific applications with computational science researchers. The “co-design” of the system and applications was a key to making it power efficient and high performance. In this talk, the system and performance of Fugaku will be presented as well as an overview of the FLAGSHIP 2020 project.",

These include placement fence regions, power/ground rail alignments, timing, wire length and etc. In advanced technology nodes, designs can easily contain millions of mutiple-row standard cells, which challenges the scalability of modern legalization algorithms. In this paper, for the first time, we investigate dedicated legalization algorithms on heterogeneous platforms, which promises intelligent usage of CPU and GPU resources and hence provides new algorithm design methodologies for large scale physical design problems. Experimental results on IC/CAD 2017 and ISPD 2015 contest benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, compared to the state-of-the-art legalization solution for mixedcell-height designs.",

        "abstract": "Beyond possessing large enough size to feed data hungry machines (eg, transformers), what attributes measure the quality of a dataset? Assuming that the definitions of such attributes do exist, how do we quantify among their relative existences? Our work attempts to explore these questions for video action detection. The task aims to spatio-temporally localize an actor and assign a relevant action class. We first analyze the existing datasets on video action detection and discuss their limitations. Next, we propose a new dataset, Multi Actor Multi Action (MAMA) which overcomes these limitations and is more suitable for real world applications. In addition, we perform a biasness study which analyzes a key property differentiating videos from static images: the temporal aspect. This reveals if the actions in these datasets really need the motion information of an actor, or whether they predict the occurrence of an action even by looking at a single frame. Finally, we investigate the widely held assumptions on the importance of temporal ordering: is temporal ordering important for detecting these actions? Such extreme experiments show existence of biases which have managed to creep into existing methods inspite of careful modeling.",

Semiconductor systems, whether cell-phones, laptops, servers or machine learning accelerators, require an increasing number of processing units, larger caches and faster interfaces while managing cost and power dissipation. As we continue to push the transistor, interconnect and memory scaling to smaller geometries, the industry is moving quickly towards 3D heterogeneous integration for higher density, performance and faster time-to-market. This presentation will review recent market trends and focus on advances in process scaling for libraries, memories and external interfaces. We will cover several design and technology co-optimization (DTCO) techniques that enable higher transistor density and performance. One example is the 2D fin depopulation from 4 to 3 and more recently 2 fins. We will also explore heterogeneous integration, where complex systems are partitioned into multiple chiplets that are assembled in 2.5D or 3D topologies. In particular, we will discuss 3D integration performance and energy improvements, as well as mitigation techniques for cooling and yield challenges.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Advanced packaging architectures are today widely acknowledged as being increasingly important to drive performance and cost improvements of microelectronics systems. This trend is set to continue as on-package heterogeneous integration of diverse IP from multiple process nodes and multiple foundries will enable new product concepts, decrease time to market and deliver cost/yield benefits. Additionally, novel 3D architectures and continued die-to-die interconnect scaling are opening previously un-achievable concepts for die partitioning. These advanced packaging architectures provide a means to offer improved functional integration, but also present technical challenges across the supply chain [Die -> Package -> Board -> System]. This presentation will highlight key challenges the industry will have to jointly address to enable the 3D heterogeneous integration future. Key areas of focus will be: (1) Drivers and directions in interconnect scaling, (2) Standardization of die-to-die connections, (3) Thermal management to address new power envelopes, and (4) Advanced power delivery technologies required to address the needs of complex packages. The talk will conclude with a call for broad collaboration across industry and academia in multiple areas including technology R&D, design, standardization, and supply chain development.",

We will live and interact with the virtual objects that are blended into our environments with advanced holographic technology or with high-quality head mounted displays and lose the virtuality boundary. We call such a new reality Surreality. Our vision of “metaverse” is a multi-world. There are multiple virtual worlds developed by different technology companies and there is also the Surreality where real and virtual merged. While the metaverse may seem futuristic, catalysed by emerging technologies such as Extended Reality, 5G, and Artificial Intelligence, the digital “big bang” of our cyberspace is not far away. This talk aims to offer a comprehensive framework that examines the latest metaverse development under the dimensions of state-of-the-art technologies and metaverse ecosystems, illustrates the possibility of the digital “big bang”, and propose a concrete research agenda for the development of the metaverse. Reality will die; long live Surreality.",

When linear and quadratic models fail to represent data using RSM adequately, an alternative technique must be used, which involves choosing the appropriate transformations applied to either the response variable or the explanatory variables. A Tukey transformation and Box-Cox method are applied to the response variable in this article to improve the model's adequacy. A previously performed biological experiment is presented, and RSM is applied with power transformations without iterating the experiment. A parameter in the transformed response surface models is also estimated using the maximum likelihood and Draper and Smith methods.",

Safety is the most crucial issue for developing and applying various robots and systems nowadays. The service robot has a wide range of applications diversely exploited in our society as suggested in the definition of World Robotics, IFR. The safety discussed here includes both physical safety and ANSHIN. The physical safety means a common sense of safety as suggested by safety engineering, industrial safety standard, etc. The physical safety will include issues on how to secure safety and safety recovery from unsafe conditions in explosion, disaster, contamination and whatever dangerous. ANSHIN means psychological safety or mind safety, which includes various feelings and states of mind; familiarity, peace of mind, no stress, no anxiety, etc. The topic on AHSHIN comes to more important issue when we bring the service robots and systems to their actual applications. How we feel toward service robot and intelligent systems working in and around our daily life, how we evaluate our ANSHIN situation quantitatively are crucial as well as securing physical safety of robots and systems. We need to discuss both safeties in the aspects of what the state-of-the arts, what is the current issues, how we solve them. The workshop aims to discuss a wide range of safety issues on robots and systems. The workshop is planned to include keynotes and several voluntarily proposed talks selected by call for proposal. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: safety recovery from contamination, destruction & disaster; robot/system safety to prevent human from dangerous and harmful environment; safety in human machine interaction; safety by teleoperation; analysis, evaluation & designing of ANSHIN robot/system (friendly & psychologically secured robot/system); safety standard; ethics; privacy; legal issues; sustainability.

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Giant tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect and spin-transfer torque (STT) in MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are the key technologies in magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM). STT-MRAM has been commercialized as embedded non-volatile memory for system LSI. For MRAM to replace SRAM, however, MRAM needs to have higher speed and lower energy consumption for writing. For developing such advanced MRAM, we have been working on new writing technology as well as MTJs with materials. Voltage-induced dynamic switching based on voltage control of magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) is expected to be an ultimate writing technology with ultra-low power consumption. By doping 5d elements into Fe electrode of MgO-based MTJ, we have achieved very high VCMA coefficient (>300 fJ/Vm), which is sufficient for cache memory application. The biggest remaining issue for developing novel voltage-controlled MRAM (VC-MRAM) is the high write error rate (WER) of the dynamic switching. By controlling the spin dynamics induced by ultra-fast voltage pulses, we have successfully suppressed WER below 10-6, which is sufficiently low for some applications. Aiming at more reliable voltage-induced switching, we have also been working on new writing methods based on VCMA. We have also developed new process technologies such as epitaxial growth of MTJ films on large Si wafers and 3-dimensional integration process based on direct wafer bonding to integrate fully epitaxial MTJs in MRAM chips. With these new process technologies, we can use MTJs with new barrier/electrode materials in MRAM.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Silicon photonics (SiP) has been shown as one of the key photonic integration (PI) technologies for applications of next generation data interconnections, where higher capacity and cost-effective data processing can be introduced through CMOS-compatible processing. However, due to the indirect bandgap properties in Si-related material, efficiency and optical generation in SiP is restricted. Integration of thin-film III-V quantum confined material then has become one of the best solutions for fulfilling future applications. Several types of hybrid III-V/Si optical waveguide devices for emerging high-speed data applications will be introduced and presented. Chip-scale in-plane III-V active devices have been integrated on Si-related material passive devices through adhesive material. Selective undercut etching technique for self-alignment processing between different materials were used to develop optical mode converter, realizing high-performance and small-footprint light source and modulators and thus enabling PI. By taking the advantages of Si grating-based element and III-V etching technique, high power with low reflection functional optical light source can be brought on the level SiP, enabling vertical type of PI. Properties such as high speed as high as above 58Gbaul optical modulation, mW scale of optical power level, and high-efficiency modulation have been shown, realizing such hybrid PI template.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a framework for scheduling electric buses with the aim of minimizing their overall operational costs as well as the required fleet. The scheduling problem of electric buses comes with several real-time constraints such as the location of the charging stations, number of time-tabled trips, the distance between the depots, etc. The main objective is to minimize the running costs of the electric buses on the road network while satisfying the underlying constraints. The cooperative multi-agent model segregates the scheduling problem into a master agent and a bus agent through asymmetric communication, and this decentralized approach allows the scheduling to happen in a real-time scenario. The proposed scheme is tested on the public transport network of the Maltese Islands.",

In supercomputing, high-performance computing (HPC) applications require large amounts of parallel processing capability and high memory bandwidth. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) applications, which have characteristics similar to HPC applications, have played an important role in supercomputers. The supercomputer Fugaku has a large number of general-purpose processors for high performance, high-density implementation as well as low power consumption to realize a massive parallel system for multiple applications targeting HPC and AI. Furthermore, in terms of availability, reliability in large-scale systems such as Fugaku is important. Fugaku is a supercomputer comprising >7.6 million cores and has remained No.1 in the Top 500 for three consecutive terms because it achieved 442 Petaflops at 29.9 Mega Wat in June 2020. In this session, for large-scale systems, we describe how CPUs in Fugaku solve challenges of high performance, low power consumption, and reliability.",

For example, they may be good for applications where their ultrathin nature and lack of dangling bonds give them distinct advantages, such as flexible electronics [1] or DNA-sorting nanopores [2] . They may not be good for applications where conventional materials work well, like in transistors thicker than a few nanometers. I will focus on the case of 2D materials for 3D heterogeneous integration of electronics, which presents significant advantages for energy-efficient computing [3] . In this context, 2D materials could be monolayer transistors with ultralow leakage [4] (taking advantage of larger band gaps than silicon), used as access devices for high-density data storage [5] . For example, recent results from our group have shown monolayer transistors with record performance [6] , [7] , which cannot be achieved with sub-nanometer thin conventional semiconductors. I will also describe some less conventional applications, using 2D materials as highly efficient thermal insulators [8] and as thermal transistors [9] . These could enable control of heat in “thermal circuits” analogous with electrical circuits. Combined, these studies reveal fundamental limits and some unusual applications of 2D materials, which take advantage of their unique properties.",

        "abstract": "Advantages of 3D printing have led to its use in most diverse industries plus the low budget segment in printed electronics. Printing of FDM-printed PCBs with a low budget printer is possible e.g., a connection for small low power sensor and visualisation applications. Already the filaments research for additive manufacturing shows, that the FDM-printed PCB conductivity must be significantly lower compared to copper use. The investigation of FDM-printed PCBs versus conventional PCBs regarding their current-carrying capacity and thermal properties confirm comparable results. The conductive filament can only safely conduct currents in the single-digit mA range at wider cross-sections. Upon higher current application, it exhibits hot conductor properties and a permanently lower conductor resistance. The results reveal new uses, and these provide the opportunity for further investigations.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. As the feature size of silicon-based integrated circuits (ICs) approaches the physical limit, short-channel effects appear, gate control attenuates, and leakage current increases, which seriously affects transistor performance and causes chip failure. Due to the inherent thickness of bulk silicon, the physical area cannot be further reduced, which restricts the area efficiency of silicon-based ICs. In addition, the speed mismatch between memory readout and logic operation, and the separation of memory and computing units together form the memory wall bottleneck in silicon-based ICs. With unique characteristics, including no dangling bond surface, atomic-level thickness, abundant adjustable energy bands, excellent optical electrostatic properties etc., two-dimensional (2D) materials have the potential to enhance gate control, reduce leakage, improve energy and area efficiency, and realize the integration of perception, memory and computing. This report discusses the roadmap for the fusion of 2D materials and silicon ICs, including alleviating the problems faced by silicon ICs from the application of 2D materials in gate-all-around, memory and logic transistors, and enabling the creation of an all-in-one sensing, memory and computing system. Finally, it provides an outlook on the challenges and promising paths to fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs for largescale applications.",

The imaginary part of the complex frequency is the variation with respect of a synchronous reference of the local bus frequency as commonly defined in power system studies. The real part is defined based on the variation of the voltage magnitude. The latter term is crucial for the correct interpretation and analysis of the variation of the frequency at each bus of the network. The paper also develops a set of differential equations that describe the link between complex powers and complex frequencies at network buses in transient conditions. No simplifications are assumed the usual approximations of the models utilized for the transient stability analysis of power systems. A variety of analytical and numerical examples show the applications and potentials of the proposed concept.",

This work focuses on the discovery of memory effect in 2D atomically-thin nanomaterials towards greater scientific understanding and advanced engineering applications. Non-volatile memory devices based on 2D materials are an application of defects and is a rapidly advancing field with rich physics that can be attributed to atomic vacancies combined with metal adsorption. In particular the talk will highlight our pioneering work on monolayer memory (atomristors) that has expanded to over a dozen 2D sheets. In monolayer materials, the basic physics can be understood from a virtual conductive point model in contrast to conductive bridge in conventional emerging memory. The few layer materials show behavior similar to conductive bridge devices. The 2D atomristors can enable various applications including zero-power devices, non-volatile RF switches for 5G/6G communication, and memristors for neuromorphic computing.",

The talk presents two projects, which were carried out for machine-tool industry. The first one is the spindle drive based on a 3-level inverter topology capable of 30000 rpm with the rated power of 40 kW. The inverter unit has premium efficiency even at 16 kHz pulse-width modulation frequency. Coupled with a line filter it can be used as an active front-end as well. The performance of the proposed solution is compared with that of conventional 2-level power converters and pros and cons of both implementations are considered. The second project considers GaN switches implementation in a servo amplifier. The problems of high dv/dt, high current measurement delay and reliability issues were investigated. It was shown that novel inverter topologies and solutions can bring strong benefits to the market of machine-tool drives.",

Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing are driving an exponentially growing demand for optical interconnect bandwidth. From the datacenter network down to the chip level, Silicon Photonics is a prime technology to scale optical interconnects to the desired bandwidth density, power and cost. In this presentation, we give an overview of imec's Silicon Photonics Platform (iSiPP), designed to realize optical I/O scaling by leveraging established CMOS manufacturing and advanced 3-D integration methods. We will discuss recently developed high-speed silicon optical devices, TSVenabled Silicon Photonics interposers and low-loss fiber coupling structures. We will showcase a hybrid FinFET CMOS-Silicon Photonics optical I/O module prototype, featuring optical bandwidth density beyond 1Tbps/mm2. Finally, we will briefly highlight some emerging applications beyond optical interconnect, enabled by Silicon Photonics.",

In the era of Digital Transformation, mitigation of environmental loads of computing systems is an urgent issue in the world. Recently, energy-efficient and capacity-scalable computing systems, such as disaggregated/distributed computing systems, are developed, where photonic technologies are intensively implemented. Silicon photonics is a unique solution to the implementation of photonics widely in computing systems. It has superior performance in energy efficiency, integration density and volume production. It would provide us ultra-wideband data transmission engines for disaggregated/distributed computing systems. It would also provide us ultra-low latency photonic neuromorphic computing engines which would be applied as processing accelerators in fast-response edge computing systems. In this talk, features of silicon photonics technology are reviewed, and moreover, recently-developed R&D eco-system in Japan is briefly touched.",

        "abstract": "Uniform sampling has been widely adopted in today's circuit designs, ranging from data converters (ADC and DAC), and discrete-time signal processing (such as switched-capacitor filters). It is a welldeveloped processing technique that leads to many circuit architectures. However, Nyquist theory does not limit us to processing the samples in a strictly uniform time grid so long as the average sample rate is sufficiently high, i.e., no loss of signal information. Why not sample the analog signal in a non-uniform time grid? What is the benefit by doing so? What is the underlying signal processing implication? In this talk, I will provide a background overview and explore new opportunities in nonuniform sampling (NUS) along with different ADC architectures that leveraged non-uniform sampling. In addition, I will show how NUS can be extended beyond an ADC and enable a different direction for a receiver design. Thanks to the unique properties of NUS, there are interesting possibilities for uncharted circuit and system design directions.",

As advanced CMOS technology keeps scaling, monolithic large scale heterogeneous system-on-chip integration becomes ever more challenging, technically, and economically. While individual functions for memory storage or logic still benefit significantly from CMOS scaling, the optimum implementation is diverging. Therefore, functional chip partitioning and heterogeneous system integration is increasingly being adopted. To avoid performance degradation caused by heterogeneous integration, short, low-parasitic, chip-to-chip interconnects are required. 3D integration technologies are now available to efficiently realize 3D connections across the entire system hierarchy: from the package to the die, to the wafer, to the standard cell and even to the transistor level, spanning an exponential 3D interconnect density scale of up to 9 orders of magnitude. As 3D integration allow for the integration of more compact systems, it also implies that power dissipation density increases, and power delivery and heat removal become significant challenges. Hot spots become increasingly localized and time variant. This requires rethinking of the standard high performance cooling approaches. This will be the main topic of this presentation.",

Mixed-signal interfaces are the essential bridges between the physical world and the digital information processing backbone. In recent years, innovation in such interfaces has been increasingly fueled by application-level insight and the data-driven nature of modern systems. As a result, the traditional building block boundaries are blurring, and the extraction of information occurs through symbiotic interplay between analog and digital signal processing. In this talk, I will illustrate this trend using examples of small-scale data analysis and machine learning inference systems that operate near the physical interface. Specific examples include data-compressive interfaces for high-dimensional sensor inputs and mixed-signal feature extraction and compute fabrics for machine learning.",

This work makes use of previously presented methodologies to analyze the FPV potential in the northern American countries, estimating the yields of systems installed on the inland water basins. The FPV cost of electricity is also discussed and compared with that of traditional land-based photovoltaic (LPV) systems. This way, it is possible to estimate the capital expenditure that FPV should target to be cost-competitive with LPV.",

        "abstract": "Although the fiber optic backbone had been completed, R&D of semiconductor lasers became more active with the goal of longer and faster transmissions. The $1.55 \\upmu\\mathrm{m}$ band had contributed significantly to longer distances, but required a new challenge, the development of single-mode laser under high-speed modulations. The DFB enabled single mode lasing, however modulation-induced chirping was still a problem for higher speed. Modulation schemes were analyzed theoretically and experimentally to reduce the chirping. This study enabled high-speed transmission up to 10 Gb/s, but also revealed a fundamental trade-off between chirping linewidth and modulation speed. This trade-off, would limit transmission length and bitrate, promoted developments of new devices, including the external feedback laser, the multi-electrode DFB laser, and the EA integrated DFB laser.",

With optical fiber and semiconductor lasers as new weapons supported by completely new mechanisms, great deal of efforts were devoted to the vision and verification of the reliability and economic efficiency that should be provided as a social infrastructure. We would like to look back on the systems approach toward the construction of a new era, and use it as good lessons for progress in 5G and beyond networks.",

Quantum computers require a classical – i.e., non-quantum – electronic interface to drive quantum operations on quantum bits (qubits), and to read out their quantum state. As quantum processors scale up to comprise more and more cryogenic qubits, the availability of a cryogenic electronic controller is crucial to support such scaling by avoiding the many unreliable and bulky interconnects connecting the cryogenic devices to room-temperature controllers. In this talk, we will review the latest advances in cryo-CMOS electronics for quantum-computing applications, both by TU Delft and other academic and industrial researchers, so as to identify the current trends and the needs still to be addressed. In particular, we will focus on the progress in the development of the individual high-performance circuit blocks (ADC, PLL, LNA,…) and in the trend to integrate qubit drivers, readouts, and biasing in largescale SoCs. By addressing the unsolved issues in this rapidly growing research field, we will outline the path towards the future comprehensive cryo-CMOS electronic interfaces that will enable largescale quantum computers.",

Two-dimensional (2D) materials (graphene, black phosphorus (BP), TMDs, etc) have been intensively studied over the past decades owing to their tremendous electrical properties, which shows potential for next-generation nan-electronics. However, before the particle integration of 2D materials into the IC devices, there still exhibits many issues, including the air/process instability, limited electronic structure modification, and lack of defect-free and wafer scaled transferring process. In this talk, the first part, we report for the first time on the in-situ cleaning and selective functionalization of 2D BP, where the selective functionalization and passivation not only enhanced stability in the air but also highly improve the electrical properties of the BP field-effect transistor (FET), with the high on-current and enhanced carrier mobility and on/off ratio. Also, the BP as functional active layers for artificial synapse memristors will be demonstrated. In the second part, I will introduce the efficient and reliable method for the wafer-scaled transferring of graphene and other 2D materials with higher integrity and ultraclean surface, which is beneficial for the following BEOL device integration. Also, the ultraclean transferring of a 6” graphene wafer will be demonstrated as an ideal epitaxial substrate for the industrial growth of high crystallinity of GaN for future niche lighting and high-power devices.",

The use of deep-learning (DL) based AI has grown dramatically over the last few years. The accuracy delivered by DL has enabled new levels of automation for many tasks, and DL has proven to be very effective for processing unstructured data such as natural language and image data that is difficult to handle otherwise. The computational demands of these AI methods are high and are growing exponentially; satisfying them requires large improvements in compute latency, throughput, and energy efficiency. To address the challenges and opportunities of AI computing, the IBM Research AI Hardware Center has undertaken an end-to-end approach to enhance compute efficiency and improve performance. This includes developing algorithmic innovations such as arithmetic precision scaling while maintaining iso-accuracy, new digital AI chip architectures informed by these new algorithms, novel analog in-memory hardware with networks mapped on to arrays of non-volatile memory elements, heterogeneous integration technologies to enable balanced system performance, and the software innovations needed to enable system integration. In this presentation I will explore the challenges and opportunities in this exciting space of AI hardware design.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Superconducting (SC) qubit devices are now greater than 100 qubits. Extending beyond 1000 qubits is in the offing. There are many opportunities to improve upon present ‘brute force’ approaches to achieve 1000 qubits and beyond. Many areas of expertise in the VLSI community overlap research directions for extending SC device size including: materials, processing, metrology, packaging, RF electronics, microwave transduction as well as system co-design. This talk will coarsely sketch a representative hardware system that is deployed by IBM to highlight some overlaps with the VLSI community interests. The talk will then discuss an illustration of variable qubit infidelity, ε, across a device. A common challenge in solid-state approaches is variability in materials, fabrication and resulting coherence times. A uniform ε well below 10-3 is often estimated in the literature as what will be needed to make quantum error correction (QEC) practical (i.e., large scale quantum computing (QC) practical). The ε target can, however, become stricter in the presence of a spread of infidelities and the presence of ‘unusable’ qubits. Numbers of qubits necessary for a task are non-linearly dependent on the target value, in the QEC paradigm, which highlights the importance of maximizing uniformity and yield. The example highlights, therefore, an area of related interests, finesse of materials, fabrication and packaging for devices sensitive in some instances to control at the atomic scale.",

Several memory types such as MRAM, ReRAM, SRAM, PCM are potential candidates, and research groups make major progress in the TOPS/W index over the years. Different application scenarios of deep learning accelerators may impose constraints and limitations that favor one candidate over another. Thus, it is important to consider pros and cons of each in-memory computing technology to meet the system requirement. In this presentation, we would like to discuss some practical considerations in the deep learning accelerator design when we want to fully utilize the advantages of in-memory computing technologies.",

In this talk, we report on the first demonstration of atomically thin In 2 O 3 channel for logic and memory devices by a back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD) process [1] , [2] . High performance planar In 2 O 3 transistors with high mobility of 113 cm 2 /V•s and record high maximum drain current of 2.5 mA/um are achieved by channel thickness engineering and post-deposition annealing. High-performance ALD In 2 O 3 based zero-V GS -load inverter is demonstrated with maximum voltage gain of 38 V/V and minimum supply voltage (V DD ) down to 0.5 V. ALD In 2 O 3 3D Fin transistors are also demonstrated, benefiting from the conformal deposition capability of ALD [3] . High-performance In 2 O 3 ferro-electric transistors are demonstrated using ALD HfZrO 2 gating with >2.2V large memory window, >10 years retention and >10 8 endurance [4] . These results suggest ALD oxide semiconductors and devices have unique advantages and are promising toward BEOL-compatible monolithic 3D integration.",

The reviving of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is changing our lives due to the superior performance in computer vision, nature language processing, and decision making and control tasks. Recently, computing in memristor (CIM) technology is considered as an unconventional approach to meet the urgent needs of high computing efficiency and throughput in continuously developing AI applications. In contrast to von Neumann architecture, computing in memristor technology avoids the data movement between computing units (such as CPU and GPU) and memory unit which would greatly reduce computing latency and power consumption. Memristor is one kind of novel non-volatile memory devices which could not only store information with multi-bit, but also conduct core computing operations of AI algorithm. Assembling memristors in a crossbar structure, it could carry out in-situ parallel multiply-accumulation (MAC) computation. To make the best use of the memristors in neuromorphic systems, a memristor-friendly architecture and the software-hardware collaborative design methods are essential, and the key challenge is how to utilize the memristor’s analog behavior. The talk will discuss recent development of analog computing in memory technology from device engineering, circuit design and architecture optimization perspectives. Further, the system and technology co-optimization (STCO) method is proposed to fully unleash the potential of CIM for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Performance predictions of nanodevices ideally include 1) atomistic resolution, 2) a consistent description of all quantum phenomena, and 3) a realistic treatment of incoherent scattering on phonons and impurities. It is common believe that atomistic quantum transport either entails unfeasible numerical load or neglects scattering effects altogether. The latest incoherent scattering models of the quantum transport implementations of NEMO5 are presented. They faithfully reproduce - without adjustable parameters - experimental observations of band gap narrowing and Urbach band tails in a sequence of III-V semiconductors and transition metal dichalcogenides. These scattering models are fully compatible with NEMO5’s low-rank approximations that accurately solve quantum transport in nanowire transistors for < 1% of the original numerical load – making them feasible for few nodes compute infrastructure. The new quantum transport method ROBIN overcomes notorious shortcomings of periodic boundary conditions in material simulations. It is exemplified on graphene alloyed with Si atoms that the periodicity assumption elevates small perturbations to systematic changes of material properties: Assuming the Si alloy atoms are periodically distributed yields a bandgap in graphene, while random Si distribution shows only a linear shift of the graphene Dirac cone which is in quantitative agreement with experimental observations.",

One of them is the communication security and it became no longer an option but a necessity. In this paper, we would like to introduce the results of implementing the pilot systems and integrated testing for electric vehicle charging infrastructure E-to-E security. PKI systems were implemented based on ISO/IEC 15118 which is the global communication standard between EV and EVSE, and the other pilot systems were configured and upgraded as almost same level as the field devices. And through this paper, we eventually wish to provide valid contributions to EVCI stakeholders for the next level of charging services.",

In this article, the purpose is to regulate and control the temperature and humidity of the air in a room with specific dimensions. The dynamical equations of the HVAC system are presented as equations of temperature and humidity variation. A control system based on LQR optimal control method is designed for this air conditioning system including two heating and cooling operations. Then, after examining the stability of the system based on the Lyapunov stability criterion, and also a temperature control performance index is defined to express and compare the performance of control system with different gains. Finally, by performing the simulation, the control and HVAC system performance is evaluated with the help of defined performance index in the presence of designed algorithm which results show that LQR gains have direct effect on energy consumption and control system performance.",

Selections of appropriated lasers were made for the applications depending on the intrinsic performances, such as DFB lasers with wavelength stability and DBR lasers with wavelength tunability. As for the applications of undersea cable systems, high reliability was required, and further devised structures were necessary to reach to a λ/4-shifted DFB laser. The unique fabrication method of λ/4-shifted grating was developed to realize quite wavelength-stable single-mode light sources which were actually installed to TPC-4 and other coherent optical systems.",

This talk will provide an overview of Spin-Transfer-Torque MRAM, including an introduction to the basic physics of spin-transfer torque and applications of SpinTransfer-Torque MRAM. Then I will review why perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is advantageous for MRAM compared to in-plane anisotropy, and the materials challenges of perpendicular anisotropy. I will discuss the research at IBM in 2009 that led to our discovery of perpendicular anisotropy in thin CoFeB/MgO layers, and our use of these layers to make the first practical perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions and the first demonstration of reliable writing in Spin-Transfer-Torque MRAM. Finally I will review our recent results on methods to lower the switching current of Spin-Transfer-Torque MRAM by using optimized magnetic materials and double magnetic tunnel junctions, and our recent demonstration of the world’s first 14 nm node MRAM.",

As surveillance cameras have been widely installed worldwide, although the main purpose of those cameras is for monitoring, but the most important task is to be able to analyze video contents and extract useful information. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep learning-based computer vision techniques utilizing multi-layer neural network is drastically improving the performance of video analytics to a certain extent. Several on-going researches on deep learning-based video analytics such as image super resolution, real-time multiple face recognition system, video anomaly detection and several implementations of embedded video analytic system on FPGA and Single Board Computers will be discussed. Some use cases of utilizing video analytics will also be mentioned. ",

Ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FEFETs) have emerged as an exciting candidate for embedded non-volatile memory technology. In this talk, we will discuss means to overcome the key outstanding technological challenges of FEFETs for high-density, ultra-high speed, embedded memory applications, namely (1) read-after-write delay, (2) voltage scaling, and (3) variation. We will describe how interfacial layer engineering and ferroelectric grain structure control can be utilized to overcome the trade-offs between voltage, reliability, variation, speed and density, for advanced node integration of FEFETs.",

I will first go over key technology trends in the high-performance computing field, driving the growth. Then I will dive into what the key application drivers are and key requirements for system level integration. I will further talk about the power of the platform, and what’s most important to integrate at the package level. Finally, I will talk about key design considerations of chiplet partition and system level integration to maximize the system level PPA.",

The 6G should begin to be specified in 2028 to be commercialized in 2030, ten years after the 5G. The 5G-Advanced will be released in 2025. Specifications begin to be well defined and give some indications if the 6G is presented as the continuation of the 5G. If there is a strong break, it will be to go to a completely distributed environment in which MEC data centers (Multi-Access Edge Computing) will be embedded in terminal equipment or in nodes located a few tens meters from the users. The solution that seems to be emerging is an aggregation of the two previous solutions using the Cloud Continuum, i.e. data centers ranging from embedded Edge to hyperscalers. Virtual machines that will support all applications, common services and digital infrastructure services will need to find the best position within the Cloud Continuum to optimize safety, quality of service and resiliency. Artificial intelligence will play a particularly important role in automating the entire system and optimizing controls.",

IoT or AIoT devices manage very valuable assets - data. The information contained in these data is all-encompassing. Therefore, how to protect these important data is getting more and more attention. As an integral part of the AIoT device, in addition to protecting the security of its firmware and processing data, the microcontroller must also maintain correct operation to avoid becoming a security vulnerability. We'll describe the security functions that the microcontroller needs to resist attacks from software or hardware.",

        "abstract": "There were two possibilities, namely GaInAsP/InP or AlGaAsSb/GaSb, to create a semiconductor laser operating at possible minimal loss band of silica fiber, as suggested by Donald Keck to be around $1.4-1.7\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$, in 1973. There was no rigorous reason for their selection, however the former was dare chosen after pointless argument, considering its higher melting temperature. In the early 1979, the minimal loss wavelength was found to be $1.55\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$ and occasionally, in that summer, the RT-CW operations at this targeted band were achieved by overcoming the barrier of anti-melt back. As extensions, the phase-shift distributed feedback laser was achieved its realization, and the electro-tunable laser was demonstrated, in 1983.",

Lett. 93, 173503, 2008) based on the balance of free energy in a solar cell. We consider the full balance of all thermodynamic potentials by separating the excess free energy into excess chemical and electrostatic potentials. A layer by layer analysis of an exemplary silicon solar cell shows that the different functionalities of different parts of the solar cell, e.g., the neutral base and the space charge regions, are well reflected in the different pictures provided by looking at the thermodynamic potentials separately.",

        "abstract": "With the popularization of AIoT applications, every endpoint device is facing information security risks. Thus, how to ensure the security of the device becomes essential. Chip security is divided into software security and hardware security, both of which are indispensable and complement each other. Hardware security underpins the entire cybersecurity ecosystem by proving essential primitives, including key provisioning, hardware cryptographic engines, hardware unique key (HUK), and unique identification (UID). This establishes a Hardware Root of Trust (HRoT) with secure storage, secure operation, and a secure environment to provide a trustworthy foundation for chip security. Today's talk starts with how to use a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) to generate a unique “fingerprint” (static random number) for the chip. Next, we will address using a static random number and dynamic entropy to design a high-performance true random number generator and achieve real anti-tampering HRoT by leveraging static and dynamic entropy. By integrating NISTstandard cryptographic engines, we have created an authentic PUF-based Hardware Root of Trust. The all-in-one integrated solution can handle all the necessary security functions throughout the product life cycle as well as maintaining a secure boundary to achieve the integrity of sensitive information or assets. Finally, as hardware-level protection extends to operating systems and applications, products and services become secure.",

        "abstract": "This study presents the development and validation of a novel soiling chamber. The chamber is novel in that it includes wind induced soiling, feedback from a low-cost particulate monitor, and in-situ Isc measurements. Validation with side-by-side identical modules within the chamber produced soiling losses of 7% over 19 hours while the soiling ratio was always within 0.5% between the two modules. Initial side-by-side testing of an anti-soiling coated module versus and uncoated module demonstrated significant wind induced cleaning of the coated module. Specifically, the coated module showed only 0.8% soiling loss while the uncoated module reached as much as 10.5% soiling loss.",

        "abstract": "Recently, PAM-4 transmitters have been realized at 112Gb/s or even faster to satisfy the continuously growing demands for wireline communications. Although PAM-4 signaling performs two-fold bandwidth efficiency comparing with the NRZ counterpart, the NRZ signal still has the advantage especially in low-loss scenario like ultra-short-reach (USR) interconnection for the optical engine due to its high output swing and better SNR. This talk summarizes the design challenges for the ultra-high-speed wireline transmitters and includes design examples for 100+Gb/s applications with NRZ and PAM-4 signaling.",

        "abstract": "SAR ADCs have been getting more and more attention as technology scaling continues. Their mostly digital nature enjoys full benefit of advanced processes and leads to highly power- and area-efficient ADC designs. However, the resolution of SAR ADCs is usually around 10-12 bits limited by the comparator noise and DAC mismatch. By contrast, delta-sigma modulators can achieve highresolution A/D conversion using low-resolution quantizers and DACs; therefore, high comparator noise is acceptable, and DAC mismatch error can be alleviated by dynamic element matching (DEM). Nevertheless, delta-sigma modulators rely on analog filters to suppress the quantization error and do not benefit much from technology scaling. Recently, an emerging ADC architecture, called noiseshaping SAR, takes the advantages of both SAR ADCs and delta-sigma modulators to achieve high power efficiency and high resolution simultaneously. This talk will introduce the fundamental principle of noise-shaping SAR architecture and bring out the recent advances of circuit techniques that enhance the performance of noise-shaping SAR ADCs for different applications.",

They play a critical role in a vast range of systems, and integrated converters represent a central and growing element in high performance designs in applications from wireline to wireless and more. In this course, we start with an introduction to data converters, discussing key topologies, metrics, and the associated trade space. We continue with a discussion of ultra-high data rate converter design approaches before moving to high precision and low power converter topics. In our final session, we discuss emerging data converter concepts that will shape the future of research in this area.",

The modulator includes a 50GHz GeSi electroabsorption modulators, carrier depletion-based phase-shifters supporting Mach-Zehnder and micro-ring modulators. All modulators can support 100 Gbit/s (53Gbaud-PAM4) per lane and a total of 400 Gbit/s applications. Furthermore, we will demonstrate 4l coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM), optical fiber packaging, testing technology, targeting 400 Gbit/s application requirements.",

Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) will play a vital role in our life in the near future. This presentation will consider how AI and Robotics technology could contribute to pHRI in real life. Many researchers are working on pHRI with the belief that it will open up new research areas and lead to the creation of new robots. A robot is a system consisting of many devices and technologies. New fields of robots will be created by developing and enhancing devices and technologies to meet the requirements of those fields. Having a clear goal for the new robotics field will help researchers find the real challenges that need to be addressed for future pHRI systems. Our laboratory developed a co-worker robot, PaDY (in time Parts/tools Delivery to You robot), more than ten years ago to assist workers in the assembly process of an automotive plant. In this talk, we will present recent research results on PaDY and consider how pHRI could be applied to our daily lives.",

In this talk I will present our recent results in increasing the qubit quality and quantity using silicon and germanium quantum technology. First, we show that even a single hole can be coherently controlled. By exploiting the strong spin-orbit interaction of holes we obtain fast qubit operation with gate fidelities reaching 99.99%, setting new benchmarks for quantum dot systems. Furthermore, through dynamical decoupling we obtain record coherence times for holes and by applying this technique as a band filter we are able to measure the transversal hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins. Second, we demonstrate that quantum dot qubits and control electronics can be operated in the same temperature regime. In addition, we show that qubits can be realized using a fully-industrial 300 mm wafer process. These together define a key step toward integrated quantum circuits. Third, we construct a 2x2 quantum dot array and show qubit coupling in two dimensions. We obtain universal control and demonstrate coherent execution of a quantum circuit that entangles and disentangles all four qubits. Finally, I will present our efforts to overcome qubit-to-qubit variations, aiming to build quantum systems with fewer control lines than number of qubits, targeting to achieve a quantum advantage with the same materials and techniques that enabled todays information age.",

A supervisory function to stabilise the TEFD algorithm during switching operations and temporary faults is proposed. Resetting and latching criteria for TEFD is analysed. A TEFD based blocking scheme is suggested for detecting single earth bus bar faults in resonant and ungrounded systems.",

Surmounting the challenges and limitations encountered in any endeavor requires innovation. While the word “innovation” currently enjoys a positive connotation in the field of technology development, one simply has to recall that “innovate” is defined as “to make changes to something established” to understand why innovation is challenging on multiple fronts. For not only do we have to discover how to see past our own limitations, we also have to convince our colleagues for the need to change and follow through with the necessary leadership to actually incur change. Our field of thermal engineering is full of many great examples of innovation. In this presentation I will take us on an inspiring tour of some of my favorite innovations in thermal engineering, and I will also discuss some perspectives on techniques for successful innovation.",

However, the primary focus of systems research is usually quite narrow and limited to inference (i.e., how to efficiently execute already trained models) and image classification networks as the primary benchmark for evaluation. In this talk, we will demonstrate a holistic approach to DNN training acceleration and scalability starting from the algorithm, to software and hardware optimizations, to special development and optimization tools.",

As we are moving into a new era with data-driven applications, not only datasets need to be analyzed in a smart way (with various kinds of neural models), but also new datasets have to be generated and observed from our living environment. As a result, life quality can be enhanced and improved with better usage of natural resources. In this paper, we will introduce new types of sensors which can be used for fast medical tests. Specific cases will be covered for PCR tests under COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this goal, a new bio-chip integrates microfluidic operations (cutting, moving, mixing), location sensing, and temperature control will be introduced. Bio-protocols related to certain medical tests can be derived and applied to target samples to enhance test accuracy and throughput. Fabricated in standard CMOS technology, this novel biochip enables new solutions for medical tests related to disease diagnosis, cell therapy, and drug development.",

Robots are no longer stand-alone systems on the factory floor. The demand for industrial robots is anticipated to be growing to 65 billion euros by the year 2023. Within all areas of robotics, the demand for collaborative, mobile and more flexible systems is rising as well. The level of desired collaboration and increased flexibility will only be reached if the systems are developed as a whole, e.g. perception, reasoning and physical manipulation. However, at the same time especially smaller companies have difficulties to formulate a concrete vision and strategies for the uptake of robotics, finding skilled workforce to develop and deploy the robot systems and/or work in the manufacturing industry. The keynote will discuss on the findings from the industrial cases and dives into details on their success stories and approach taken in those.",

Due to limited OS/firmware capability and insufficient external support in IoT devices, a new security architecture becomes imminent. “Root of Trust” and “cyber resilience” strengthened with hardware are two key security measures to make IoT devices less vulnerable to cyberattacks and have ability to recover by itself after attacks. Secure MCU, secure Memory and Firmware are trio anchors for effective secure platforms in IoT devices. In this speech, how to integrate firmware, MCU and new secure Flash memory to build an effective secure IoT platforms is explored. There are tremendous opportunities for innovation in integrated MCU + Secure Flash memory solutions.",
