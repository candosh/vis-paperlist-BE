        "abstract": "The probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and cardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter are principled approximations of the general multitarget Bayes recursive filter. Both filters are single-sensor filters. Since their multisensor generalizations are computationally intractable, a further approximation - iterating their corrector equations, once for each sensor - has been used instead. This approach is theoretically unpleasing because it is not invariant under reordering of the sensors, and because it is implicitly based on strong simplifying assumptions. The purpose of this paper is to derive multisensor PHD and CPHD filters that (1) are invariant under sensor reordering, (2) require much weaker simplifying assumptions, and (3) are potentially computationally tractable (at least in the case of the multisensor CPHD filter).",

        "abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to present to design of an on-board charger with the aim of charging a plug-in vehicle battery. This charger is able to control the values of the load voltage and current and then, maintain them at a desirable value. A first converter is used to convert the grid 50 Hz electrical quantities into dc quantities. A second converter adjusts the levels to the values required by the battery and moreover, provides a galvanic isolation. The control of the first converter is realized by using a power factor corrector. The control of the second converter allows supplying the battery with correct voltage and current values. This method is one of the most efficient to design an electronic supply with a low current harmonic impact to the grid. The choice of the structure and the choice of the components are explained. Determination of the efficiency of the on-board charger, loading cost and loading time needed is investigated in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Reliability and fault tolerance of drive systems has received renewed research interest over last decade with several fault tolerant drive topologies and control schemes having been proposed and investigated. In this paper, the performance of hysteresis current vector control methodologies when applied to three common fault tolerant drive topologies has been investigated and compared theoretically and experimentally. Their advantages and limitations in terms of current value, current and torque ripples, and operating speed range etc. are considered and verified by both simulated and measured results. It is proven that by simply modifying the hysteresis current control methodology, the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) can still be achieved in post-fault operation, albeit with potentially increased current value, low frequency current and torque ripples, and compromised speed operating range.",

Particularly interesting is the trend of increasing maximum cell voltage whilst maintaining the high capacitance which characterises these devices. The desire to improve the existing technology has led to the development of an asymmetric lithium-ion capacitor technology with impressive energy storage characteristics. Presented is a direct comparison between this new technology and a more traditional supercapacitor technology relevant for power electronic applications. A new hierarchy of comparisons is introduced which is used to define, compare and contrast techniques regarding these devices for power electronic interface. Results from experimentation on real-world components are presented and conclusions drawn from the response to input conditions designed to characterise the devices. A technique for derivation of an equivalent circuit is presented for each device.",

This paper presents some design optimization studies on PMFSM with hybrid excitation applied to a hybrid electric vehicle, which have all active parts in the stator. A reduction of permanent magnet material for a constant torque and an extension in speed and torque ranges are chosen for the optimization aims. For this purpose, the original PMFSM, which has been already proposed by other researchers, is firstly just transformed to the target machine size and then, the design problem is made clear. To obtain the necessary drive performances, some design optimization are executed by means of FEA-based trial and error. As a result, it shows the proposed design is suitable for high speed HEV.",

        "abstract": "High-speed permanent magnet rotors need a non-magnetic enclosure so as to ensure structural integrity of the rotor at elevated speeds. Optimal design of the enclosure is the focus of this paper. Analytical modelling of mechanical stress in the rotor is presented. The model distinguishes between influences of enclosure geometry and fitting on the stress, while also considering rotational speed and operating temperature. Through analytical modelling, a relatively simple approach of optimizing the enclosure is achieved. This optimization approach was used in the design of a carbon fibre enclosure of an unconventional high-speed rotor with a disc shape. It is shown that a planar analytical model of stress with isotropic material assumption is sufficiently good for structural optimization of a permanent magnet rotor.",

In all high-speed machinery the bearing is a key component. Therefore, this paper presents the analysis of an active magnetic bearing suitable for a permanent magnet machine, being part of a high-speed electrical drive system. The focus is on the detailed analysis of the magnetic forces, the coupling between the different axes and the verification of the theoretical considerations by means of 3D-FEM simulations. The analysis of the bearing forces is needed to implement the position control to the prototype of the bearing system, which already has been built.",

The components of the four inverters are selected to have appropriate voltage and current ratings. Analytical expressions for semiconductor losses are reviewed and expressions for DC link capacitor losses are derived for all topologies. Three-level inverters are found to have lower semiconductor losses, but higher DC-link capacitor losses. Overall, the three-level Neutral-Point-Clamped inverter proved to be the most efficient topology.",

        "abstract": "AC power feeding systems of electric railways can be viewed as a multi-conductor chain circuit. All electrical elements along the railway, even including the short circuits and conductor breaks, can be described as series or shunt elements. According to the chain circuit topology, the mathematical model of the whole feeding system, i.e. the admittance matrix, can be assembled conveniently by appropriately modelling each element. Considering the relatively large leakage conductance of the current return rail to the ground, multi-conductor equivalent-π circuits can be adopted for each section of the feeding system. The characteristic admittance matrix, which can be calculated by the phase-modal transformation method, is introduced for the truncation treatment at terminals of a feeding system. The proposed modelling methodology has been realised using a simulation program, which can be used to investigate a wide range of problems in electric railway feeding systems, such as the conductor current distribution, the lowest train voltage at peak time, the short circuit calculation, the rail potential distribution and the harmonic propagation.",

The comparison focuses on issues such as waveform quality, voltage and current stresses on the switching devices, switching frequency per device, and conversion losses (mainly, on-state and switching losses). The modular multilevel converter (M2C) is selected as viable representative of the multilevel family in this study, because it can be extended to a high number of levels and is able to function independent of operating condition.",

Currently there is a desire to develop compact propulsion motors, where for surface vessels, the provision of a lower shaft-line height and thus lower rake angle results in higher propulsion efficiency, whilst overall mass and volume savings translate to increased payload or fuel capacity, and reduced through life costs of ownership.",

        "abstract": "The more-electric aircraft concept is a fast-developing trend in aviation industry resulting in an increase in electrical loads fed by power electronic converters. Extensive simulations need to be done for ensuring power system integrity of the next generation commercial aircraft. Since the possible number of loads in an on-board power system can be very large, the development of accurate, effective and computational time-saving models is of importance. This paper focuses on development of a modeling approach based-on functional representation of individual power system units. This provides for possibility of fast simulation of a full generator-load power system under both normal and fault conditions. The paper describes the modeling principle, illustrates the acceleration attainable and shows how the functional representation can handle fault scenarios.",

        "abstract": "SystemC is a widely used tool for prototyping Systems-on-a-Chip. Being implemented as a C++ library, a plain C++ compiler is sufficient to compile and simulate a SystemC program. However, a SystemC program needs to be processed by a dedicated tool in order to visualize, formally verify, debug and/or optimize the architecture. In this paper we focus on the tools (called front-ends) used in the initial stages of processing SystemC programs. We describe the challenges in developing SystemC front-ends and present a survey of existing solutions. The limitations and capabilities of these tools are compared for various features of SystemC and intended back-end applications. We present typical examples that front-ends should ideally be able to process, and give theoretical limitations as well as experimental results of existing tools.",

        "abstract": "The paper describes an automated method of determining an optimal ac stator winding pattern for use in electrical machines. The method combines a generalised harmonic winding analysis together with a genetic multi-objective optimisation algorithm. The user simply defines the number of stator slots, poles, phases and whether a single or double layer winding is required along with the objective functions that assess the ‘goodness’ of any winding pattern. The paper includes examples of optimised winding layouts for a number of industrial motor designs including balanced and unbalanced fractional-slot windings and in some cases determines a ‘better’ winding pattern than that recommended in the standard winding design manuals. The flexibility of the approach is further demonstrated with examples of winding patterns for multi-phase and concentrated-tooth windings.",

CID includes the ultimate determination of the intent and prediction of future actions of an object or entity via the establishment of tactical knowledge. To facilitate CID, we utilize the concept of conceptual spaces to represent cooperative and non-cooperative CID. The Choquet integral combined with Bayes risk enables methods that provide a statistical approach to adversary intent prediction through the CID knowledge spaces. The use of the Choquet Integral for CID is applied in the context of a Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) example.",

We obtain the improvement by placing the isolation element within the divider at an arbitrary phase length less than 90 degrees. As a result, the outputs of our new divider are both physically and electrically isolated. We first develop the theory behind the isolation elements. We then demonstrate the measured performance of our new divider in MMIC form.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that any 3-D state estimate computed from stereo camera measurements is corrupted by heteroscedastic noise due to the nature of the perspective projection. It is also well understood that the image measurements used to estimate the 3-D state are inherently noisy. Despite the wealth of research in this area, the accurate statistical characterisation of the uncertainty for any 3D state estimation from stereo algorithm is less well understood. This paper presents the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for 3-dimensional state estimation from a rectified stereo pair of cameras. The paper also presents a method for efficient stereo estimation via Bayesian triangulation that achieves the CRLB. These results provide a basis for 3D statistical estimation for camera-based sensor measurements.",

As the train driver shall be diverted as few as possible by this system, a constructive two-level algorithm based on the theory of optimal control and a gradient method is presented which delivers the energy-optimal regime sequence with the minimal number of regime changes. The integration of operational requirements in this algorithm is discussed in detail, in particular the consideration of the properties of the Dutch train protection system ATB EG and the integration of capacity bottlenecks as minimal speed constraints. The algorithm is applied to some representative line sections of the Dutch railway network in a case study.",

This is achieved by using a band-pass filter feed structure that increases the frequency-dependent phase difference between the individual array elements. An angular range of ± 50 degrees is obtained while using only 150 MHz bandwidth with 5.8 GHz center frequency corresponding to the ISM Band. This antenna type can be applied for detecting covered objects or for short range imaging.",

This paper identifies and relates the design parameters that influence these torque components. It describes the influence of insulation ratio, magnet size and magnet placement on the performance of the machine using finite element (FEM) based simulations. The results are compared based on developed torque, torque ripple and relative values of the resulting magnet and reluctance torque.",

        "abstract": "To date, synchronized phasor measurements have been used mainly for power system model validation, post-event analysis, real-time display, and other similar activities. However, synchrophasors have a greater potential than monitoring and visualization. Synchrophasors will increasingly contribute to the reliable and economical operation of power systems as real-time control and protection schemes become broadly used. This paper describes several synchrophasor-based protection and control systems. One of these systems uses synchrophasor information for generator shedding. The other system uses synchrophasors for backup transmission line protection for ground faults. In addition, the paper describes a user-programmable, real-time synchrophasor processor and two of its applications: a distributed bus differential protection scheme and a system integrity protection system.",

The investigation shows that generally fractional-slot IPM machines have greater iron loss than SPM machines. However, the magnet loss of such topology is smaller, since their magnets are shielded by the rotor iron. The V-shape IPM machine exhibits the lowest magnet loss, because each magnet pole is formed by two pieces. Also, the magnet segmentation in both IPM and SPM machines can significantly reduce the magnet loss. Relatively this reduction is more significant in the IPM machine.",

        "abstract": "For embedded power generation within civil gas turbine engines, generators are anticipated to endure high rotor speeds coupled with large rotor diameters. With variable frequency permanent magnet generators finding increased roles due to the perceived higher torque density, the issue of rotor integrity becomes a critical issue. Although banding has been previously used in surface mounted PM (SPM) machines, they inevitably increase the airgap and hence reduce the torque capability of the machine. The flux-switching PM (FSPM) machine has been an intense topic of research for many years. By combining its armature and field sources in the stator, its rotor is a passive single piece, salient steel lamination, making it inherently suitable for high speed applications. This paper compares both machines when optimised for high speed applications by designing the rotors of both machines for mechanical integrity and comparing the electromagnetic performance.",

To benefit from CoMP by interference mitigation, UEs have to be served user centric to really leverage potential performance gains like increased capacity or spectral efficiency. This leads to a severe challenge how to assign user groups (UG) to cooperation areas (CA) in a user centric way because UGs must be found with an unique set of strongest cells. Here the so called partial CoMP concept is proposed and analyzed, which allows to serve up to 90% of all UEs in a user centric manner by their 3 strongest cells. The main achievement is to reach the significant performance gains of user centric cooperation for a practical and easy to realize system.",

VSC can be operated in active power reactive power (PQ) mode, active power voltage (PV) mode, voltage frequency mode (Vf), etc. The control strategy selection has large impact on the microgrid system performance. This paper analyzes and compares two typical control schemes (PQ and Vf) of the VSCs. A single bus microgrid contains four VSCs was taken as the example. The dynamic performance and load sharing methods of the two control scheme were discussed from three scenarios: (1) all the VSCs operated in Vf mode, (2) one VSC operated in Vf mode and the other ones in PQ mode, (3) a group of VSCs operated in Vf mode and another group in PQ mode. The performances of the system are simulated in PSCAD software. The difference between the control strategies can be obtained from the simulation results and the effect of the control modes on frequency variation were summarized.",

The prerequisite of a field network includes real-time support for mixed traffic, availability, security, reliability and scalability in a harsh industrial environment. These conditions have to be fulfilled by any wireless network in order to operate. This paper presents a brief overview of the requirements for wireless in process automation, relative standings of existing short-range wireless network technologies based on the outlined criteria, and associated shortcomings. Furthermore, an examination of emerging industrial wireless standards which are designed to address the unique and stringent requirements of the process industry, is presented.",

We present how the BioRob robot arm is based on a combination of compliant actuation and lightweight mechanical design to obtain the flexibility, mobility and, most important, the inherent safety properties needed to implement effective and safe service robotics applications. We discuss the sensors and control structure used to damp the oscillations caused by the significant joint compliance of the arm and to obtain the accuracy needed for the intended applications. The concluding example of a typical pick and place application with teaching by manual guidance illustrates the benefits of the BioRob design for service robotics applications.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the N-1 reliable DC optimal dispatch with transmission switching. The model is a mixed integer program (MIP) with binary variables representing the state of the transmission element (line or transformer) and the model can be used for planning and/or operations. We then attempt to find solutions to this problem using the IEEE 118-bus and the RTS 96 system test cases. The IEEE 118-bus test case is analyzed at varying load levels. Using simple heuristics, we demonstrate that these networks can be operated to satisfy N-1 standards while cutting costs by incorporating transmission switching into the dispatch. In some cases, the percent savings from transmission switching was higher with an N-1 DCOPF formulation than with a DCOPF formulation.",

It works for any set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of homogeneous linear equations. A degree of consistency (and implicitly a degree of inconsistency) of a decision-making problem are defined. α-D MCDM is generalized to a set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of linear and/or nonlinear homogeneous and/or non-homogeneous equations and/or inequalities. Consistent, weak consistent, and strong consistent examples are presented in the sequel for linear and non-linear decision making problems.",

If n is the current number of tracks and m the current number of measurements, then the former has computational complexity O(mn) and the latter O(m3 n). Although the CPHD filter has better target detection and tracking performance than the PHD filter, its cubic complexity in m will limit its practicality in many applications. The primary purpose of this paper is to derive a CPHD filter that, because of a simplified clutter model, has computational complexity O(mn). I also show how to extend this new CPHD filter to the multisensor case.",

        "abstract": "Multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) based on voltage source converters (VSC) has been getting attention in recent years as a potential solution for integrating offshore wind farms, offshore loads and remote asynchronous grids. One important issue raised in developing such a system is the impact of loadfrequency changes on the power flow of different ac grids connected to an MTDC grid. Instantaneous power is balanced by use of frequency droop control inside the ac grids and by dc voltage droop control inside the MTDC. Hence, depending on the converter control implementations, load-frequency changes occurring in one ac grid can be reflected in the other asynchronous ac grids. In this paper these load-frequency sensitivities are investigated and analytical expressions describing these relations are derived. A four terminal dc grid was simulated in PSCAD and results confirmed validity of the derived frequency sensitivity expressions.",

In this mode, we can take the initiative to control streetlights through PC monitor terminal. In addition, the system integrates a digital temperature-humidity sensor, not only monitoring the streetlight Real-time but also temperature and humidity. The system is equipped with the high-power relay output and can be widely applied in all places which need timely control such as streets, stations, mining, schools, and electricity sectors and so on.",

        "abstract": "Wind generation and wind farms are becoming an important part of the generating capacity of the modern utility grid. Protection of wind turbines, and wind farm collector systems, has been the subject of numerous technical papers over recent years, as wind generation grows more prevalent. These papers have focused on the basics of protecting the wind turbines, protecting the wind farm, and modelling of wind farms for stability studies. However, few have focused on practical aspects of protection and control systems when wind turbines and collectors systems are distributed over many square kilometres of surface area. There are design, construction, and maintenance decisions to make for a wind farm, such as where to physically mount protective relays, laying out copper wiring between measurement sources and protective relays, and realistic and affordable maintenance programs for protective relays. Maintenance can quickly become an issue if relays are located at each individual wind turbine. These decisions become much more complicated when the wind farms are located offshore, as the cost of installation, and the cost of maintenance, increase dramatically. This paper proposes a protection and control (P&C) approach based on IEC61850 process bus architecture. Ruggedized Merging Units (MUs) can be installed at individual wind turbines to acquire AC measurements (as raw sampled values) and status information, as well as provide control points. Data is transmitted via IEC 61850 messages over a fibre optic communications network to a Central Relaying Unit (CRU) which executes P&C functions for a whole wind farm.",

The fuel cell system by itself has some dynamic limitations, which are overcome by adding a supercapacitor. Therefore, the fuel cell supplies the load during the long term steady state, while the supercapacitors bank feeds sudden peak power requirements in short intervals. The presented results show how the fuel cell-supercapacitor back-up system is effective on fulfilling the strict telecommunications equipment requirements, even during load power demand variations.",

        "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to analyze the building energy saving effects of different window shading devices in hot summer and cold winter zone. Two typical residential and public buildings were modeled in building energy simulation software DOE-2. The energy saving potential of these two buildings in each direction was calculated. Then the room base temperatures of typical rooms were calculated and used to determine the shading season. Finally 6 kind of shading schemes composed of different shading devices were applied in these two buildings and the heating, cooling and total building energy savings were simulated. The results show that shading devices in west facing have the best energy saving effect, less than which in east and north facing, and least in south facing, and movable shading devices are more effective than fixed ones in the reduction of building energy consumption.",

The method proposed in this paper contains following steps; first, calculate the optimal positions for sensors according to the application requirements; then using AIS based method to calculate the appropriate positions for sensors to redeploy. In AIS based solution, the antibody is the assignment between nodes and optimal positions; the affinity is the total distance of mobile nodes moving. The simulation results show that the AIS based redeployment scheme (AISRD) can provide a shorter convergence time and less of the total distance than the genetic algorithm (GA) based scheme.",

        "abstract": "During the last decade, the needs for exploitation of distributed generation (DG), including renewable energy such as photovoltaic, wind turbine, fuel cells, etc., has been growing. In spite of many economic and technical advantages of DG, high penetration of DG in distribution systems would cause some negative impacts on distribution network operation such as increase of fault current level, false tripping, etc. In this paper, the impacts of DG's on protection coordination and operation of distribution network are analyzed including increase of the level of fault current, malfunctioning of protective devices and protection coordination of CB-reclosers. And Test of directional recloser and directional distribution automation FRTUs is also carried out to validate the directional elements and fault indication function of these bidirectional devices using real-time power system simulator. These directional overcurrent elements and fault indication of bidirectional devices are tested and is validated in various fault condition in distribution network with distributed generation using real-time power system simulator.",

The proposed controller of each subsystem only relies on local state variables with no any information exchanges with other subsystems. In order to eliminate the effects of interconnections, state delays and uncertainties, the adaptive parameters are updated along iteration axis. Simulation results demonstrate, utilizing the proposed adaptive controller, the tracking error for each subsystem converges along the iteration axis.",

It analyzed the characteristics of dual input dual output (DIDO) of the H-drive precision XY stage during different mass ratio of x slide and y beam as well as position of x slide. The analysis presented the changing rule of stage's mass center and payload ratio of the two motors. And a cross-coupling controller was designed based on the H-drive model and analysis. The result of the simulation shows that the cross-coupling controller can effectively improve the positioning property and restrain external disturbance by suppressing the unsynchronized position of the H-drive.",

Over a period of thirty years, the authors have studied remanufacturing and have issued reports on various aspects of the industry. This paper will describe some of what we have learned during three decades of research on the topic: industry structure and scope, patterns in inputs and costs, forms of organization of remanufacturing enterprises, beneficial aspects of remanufacturing, and implications for other countries. Remanufacturing provides a number of important benefits: greater availability of products and lower prices to customers, employment and industrial skills training to workers, and conservation of material and energy resources to society. Remanufacturers tend to enter remanufacturing, however, in the same pursuit of profits that motivates other entrepreneurs.",

High permeability nanocrystalline cores are being increasingly utilized in designs due to their high saturation flux density, high power density, and lower power loss, for a given volume. This paper presents the design and implementation of a high frequency nanocrystalline cored transformer operating at 14 kHz, and used in a high current low voltage dc-dc converter with a 600 V input, and an 8 V, 1000 A output requirement. Power loss analysis and leakage inductance calculation are derived to evaluate the transformer performance. Simulation and experimental results are also presented to validate the design.",

        "abstract": "Power grid intellectualization is an important method to promote the development of renewable energy source and implement energy conservation and emission reduction. Along with the increasing development of power electronics, IT and communication technologies, the construction of smart grid is becoming an important development direction of electric power industry. Smart distribution grid is a critical part of smart grid and fault location plays an important role in smart distribution grid, so it is very important to study fault location for smart distribution grid. Every smart distribution unit is regarded as an agent and all agents construct a multiagent system. Every agent detects synchronously the corresponding feeder information in real-time. When one feeder is fault, every agent obtains transient zero voltage and current and computes transient zero reactive power in special frequency bands. Through communication and collaboration among agents, all fault information is shared. According comparing to amplitude and direction of transient zero reactive power between neighbor nodes, the fault section is located. The simulation results show that the multi-agent based fault location system for smart distribution grid not only realizes accurate location of fault section, but also possess stronger robustness.",

        "abstract": "This work focuses on the operational behavior of an adjustable drive system, consisting mainly of a matrix converter and an induction machine, in the case of faults that occur either on the MC or the induction machine. In detail, faults that lead to the open-circuit of a single bidirectional switch of the MC or an entire MC leg are considered. It is confirmed that these faulty conditions deteriorate severely the operation of the examined drive system resulting in no fault tolerance of the drive. The possibility the drive system's operation to be continued after such a fault is diagnosed, and until repairing becomes potential, is examined. The cases of adding a redundant switch to connect the source's neutral to the load's neutral and the case of a 4-leg MC are evaluated. A remedial MC control algorithm realizing a carrier based modulation method for the case of a 4-leg MC is proposed resulting in a significant improvement of the matrix converter's fault tolerance and reliability.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, energy storage devices such as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are available to address the high specific energy (compared to electrolytic capacitors) and high specific power (compared to batteries) applications, and most of them would consist of constant power operation which means that the current handled by the device needs to compensate the variation of the voltage. Also, for most of these applications, a minimum round trip efficiency has to be achieved from the design stage in conjunction with the variation of the voltage and current during a charge-discharge cycle, which would make the estimation of efficiency quite challenging. Based on an analytical model of the supercapacitor power losses, this paper proposes a new methodology to determine the roundtrip efficiency of a supercapacitor stack operating under constant power mode by performing a simple measurement of the charging dutycycle.",

Systematic processing of such data is not as straightforward as with electronic sensor data. This paper presents work in progress towards developing a system to fuse inconsistent information and minimising observation errors. A case-study is presented, relating the techniques to the application area of civilian intelligence systems. Within our system, the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) was used to fuse soft information from observers, and combine in both the discrete and continuous spaces.",

For SiC-based devices, lack of reliable models that accurately describe device performance at different temperatures is noticed. Models are either complex and requiring detailed device structure or isothermal without temperature dependency. In this paper simple power rectifier models for use by power electronics application engineers with wide temperature range are represented. This work benefits from the available models in literature and extends their soundness to a temperature range at which SiC devices are expected to function. Simulation results of forward conduction characteristics were compared with measurement results to check the credibility of used models.",

Undeniable, present artificial monitoring methods not only increase the burden of patients, relatives and medical staff, but are vulnerable to lead oversight as well. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel wireless sensor network for intravenous infusion monitoring based on slot-coupled infrared emitting diode as sensors, chip ATMEGE128L as MCU and chip CC2420 as ZigBee-based RF communication. The system has following characteristics: non-touch droplet monitor, easy to reuse, multiple protections on system accuracy and reliability, easy to integrate with existing hospital management system due to flexible design of the host computer software, low cost, and easy to launch large-scale applications.",

        "abstract": "The villages have hundred households who had to use costly diesel generator sets to get access to electricity. With setting up of micro hydro power plant, the villagers are able to not only save money but also generate employment opportunities. However, micro hydro generating units are usually isolated from the grid network and require control to maintain both the frequency of the voltage waveform and the scheduled power, for any working conditions, constant. The aim of the present work is to design a fuzzy controller that would manage almost the whole operation of the generating unit. The presented fuzzy controller has three main tasks. First, it regulates the frequency output of the plant in spite of changing user loads. Second, it limits the waste of the available water. Finally, it manages the electricity distribution by dividing the mini network on different departures connected by order of priority. Results obtained by simulation show the controller ability to control the system much better than some controllers proposed in the literature. It guarantees closed loop stability at all operating conditions. The used model for simulation was constructed based on the mathematical equations that summarize the behavior of the plant and was validated based on a micro-hydro power plant prototype.",

Smart ROVLATIS is a novel, multi-mode of operation marine robotics vehicle, developed at Mobile & Marine Robotics Research Centre (MMRRC), for operational flexibility in high-resolution near seabed survey from shallow inshore waters out to the continental shelf edge. The vehicle can operate in surface-tow mode, surface-thrusted mode and ROV operation mode. Special features of the system include: deployment interoperability for small inshore boats and larger research vessel; built-in auto-tuning of low-level controllers; fault tolerant thruster control in 6 DOF; onboard computer control enabling real-time disturbance reaction and topside augmented reality system support. The vehicle can be used as a target platform in various scenarios (research and scientific projects, inspections, seabed survey missions, vision experiments etc.).",

The proposed controller calculates the optimal air gap flux verifying high efficiency especially at light load, improving the power factor, and stable operation for a high load step disturbance. The proposed model is cheap where no additional hardware is required. The accuracy and the fast response of the proposed controller in comparison with an online search control method are proved by the experiment results. The efficiency, and the power factor improvements for speed sensorless induction motor by using the optimal flux compared with the rated flux are examined experimentally.",

For the same frame size and same output power, the basic characteristics of bipolar SSRM and bipolar switched reluctance motor (SRM), such as torque, phase currents and copper loss, are obtained and compared with 2D finite element computation. Comparison of two motors in iron loss is also carried out. It is found that the decrease in total losses over bipolar SRM is about one third, so the 8/6 bipolar SSRM will provide a novel design with lower losses and improved efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Distributed generation is increasingly likely to play a major role in electricity supply systems as recognition is made of its low carbon credentials. However, the integration of these units at distribution voltages is a major challenge for utilities. One particular issue is that generators may, unintentionally, continue to supply local demand when areas of the network are isolated from the main system. Reliably detecting this condition is regarded by many as an ongoing challenge as existing methods are not entirely satisfactory. This paper proposes a novel method based on accumulated phase angle drift that provides inherently enhanced stability without unduly sacrificing sensitivity. It is passive and thus requires no additional invasive hardware. Transient simulations are used to demonstrate its performance.",

        "abstract": "For the design of complex systems both accurate and abstract models are required. Especially for analog subsystems this trade-off is difficult. The new SystemC AMS extensions offer high simulation performance, but also serious restrictions. In this paper we model a switched capacitor sigma delta modulator using the SystemC AMS extensions. The model combines high simulation performance while modeling sampling jitter, kT/C noise, switch non-linearities and operational amplifier non idealities (such as finite gain, finite bandwidth, slew rate, leakage and saturation effect). We present a complete set of sub-modules representing those non idealities implemented in SystemC-AMS. Finally, the proposed sub-modules are used to simulate a low pass second order sigma delta modulator of which results are presented.",

In this paper we will point out the advantages of the kinematics based on linear actuation and present different innovative robots studied, developed and industrialized with the LSRO (Laboratoire de Systèmes Robotiques). Each of them was designed to be tailored to industrial applications. These structures consist of fast pick-and-place robots as well as high stiffness machines for insertion and tool machining operations. To deal with this, each robot will be emphasized through its specifications and the application it has been developed for. The following Delta robots will be presented and detailed: The horizontal linear version of the Delta, the \"Delta Press\", the robot Delta Keops and the Delta Ibis.",

Two different concepts, namely the induction generator and the PM synchronous generator concept, are addressed. The dynamic models obtained are of 8th-and 6th-order respectively and contain as variables in their state vector the ones that advanced control methods, such as vector control techniques, require. Applying on these models a Lyapunov-storage-function based analysis, it is proved that the fundamental property of passivity holds true independently from the selection of the converter control. Thus, one can effectively exploit this fact in the control design in order to achieve further improvements in the wind system performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the inverter regulation using a simplified Fuzzy PI controller (SFPIC). The proposed controller is a single input Fuzzy with its fuzzification, inferences and defuzzification processes are represented by a piecewise linear control surface. This allows the computation to be faster since the surface can be easily constructed using a look-up table without compromising the performance. For verification purposes, a single-phase inverter prototype is constructed and the proposed control algorithm is implemented. From the results, it was shown that the proposed controller produced a comparable performance as its conventional Fuzzy PI controller, but with a much reduced computation time.",

        "abstract": "Three-stage eighteen-level hybrid inverter design with novel control method are presented. The inverter consists of main high-voltage, medium-voltage and low-voltage stages connected in series from the output side. The high voltage stage is a three-phase, six-switch conventional sub-inverter. The medium and low voltage stages are made of three-level sub-inverters constructed by H-bridge units. The proposed control strategy assumes a reference input voltage vector and aims to approximate it to the nearest inverter vector. The control concept is based on holding the high voltage state as long as it is feasible to do so. The reference voltage vector has been represented in a 60°-spaced two axis coordinate system to reduce the computational effort. The concept of the staged-control has been presented, the transformed inverter vectors and their relation to the switching variables have been defined, and the implementation process has been described. The test results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in terms of computational efficiency as well as the capability of the inverter to produce very low distorted voltage with low switching losses.",

        "abstract": "Power switching devices in dc/dc power converters for Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) are fluid cooled. Fluid cooled heatsinks make up nearly a third of the volume and weight of DC/DC converters. The design of heatsinks in automotive applications is therefore of paramount importance in order to gain high power-to-volume and high power-to-weight ratios. Literature on heatsink designs often present test results that are based on one set of input data only (e.g. fluid inlet temperature, flow rate and fluid mixture). The fluid inlet temperature and flow rate, however, can vary substantially in an automotive fluid cooled system and the heatsink may therefore not perform well. Fluctuation of theses parameters must therefore be considered in the design of fluid cooled heatsinks in order to allow optimal cooling performance under all conditions. This paper describes the design of a heatsink that is optimised for one set of parameters. The heatsink is then tested at temperature and flow rate variations to emulate the fluctuation in a vehicle cooling system.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses an adaptive control scheme for a bidirectional boost converter used in a hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle. The converter transforms the voltage of the low-voltage battery, approximately 96 V, to 400 V on the DC-link of the motor inverter. The switching frequency of the inverter is 80 kHz, which enables the usage of rather compact 64 µH inductors. However, the sampling frequency of the control scheme is 10 kHz, so the duty cycle of the switches will only be updated after 8 consecutive switching periods. Due to the large dead-time of the switches in comparison with the switching frequency, the response of the current to changes in the duty cycle is highly non-linear. The low sampling frequency of the control scheme combined with the highly non-linear current response makes it impossible for a simple PI-controller to regulate the current in a satisfactory way. At first the cause of the non-linear response is investigated. Based on that knowledge, a control scheme is developed that adjusts the duty cycle when necessary and switches between two PI-controllers, one for small currents and one for large currents. This current controller is implemented on two interleaved bidirectional boost converters. The current controller's set point is regulated by the DC-link voltage controller.",

        "abstract": "In recent years the use of Electric Power Steering (EPS) in small and medium-sized cars has increased as it offers significant benefits such as reduction of fuel consumption as well as increased controllability. To enable the use of EPS systems in larger vehicles, the output power has to be increased without increasing the maximum current drawn from the battery. This can be achieved by using a Power Boost Unit (PBU) local to the EPS that incorporates a supercapacitor. The PBU provides a short burst of high current to meet transient load demands by exploiting the energy storage capability of supercapacitors. In this way, systems which operate at high power for a short term can be utilised without exceeding automotive battery current restrictions. This paper describes the design and operation of a 2kW prototype Power Boost Unit. Experimental results confirm the functionality of the unit.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new protection scheme for transmission lines equipped with UPFC based on the synchronized phasor measurements at both ends of the line. The fault detection and location indices based on sequence components are derived and used to discriminate the internal and external fault events accurately. The time for identifying an internal fault is well below 1/2 cycle. The performance of the detection/location indices is very good regardless of the compensated or uncompensated line configuration. The proposed protection system responds well and fast with regard to dependability and security. Moreover, the proposed scheme can protect full line length, in contrast to conventional distance relay, and is not affected by power system variations caused by UPFC during a fault. Such a capability can cope with the problem of overreaching and underreaching of the protected zone of the distance relay in the presence of UPFC.",

Our method exploits a recently introduced shape-preserving response prediction procedure that allows us to estimate the response (e.g., S-parameters over certain frequency range) of the computationally expensive microwave structure by examining the response of the computationally cheap (e.g., circuit equivalent) model of the structure. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach offers good modeling accuracy which is better than the accuracy provided by the space mapping approach, even when a very tight limit on the number of base designs used to set up a surrogate model is imposed.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new application of a chaos particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for parameter estimation of an induction machine. A chaos PSO with a logistic map has been used for initializing random values of the estimated parameters, as well as the inertia weight in the velocity update equation of the PSO. This creates the best balance for the inertia weight during the evolution process of the PSO which results in the best convergence capability and search performance. Additionally, the algorithm has also been improved with regards to the diversity in the solution space through two independent chaotic random sequences. The algorithm uses the measurements of the three-phase stator currents, voltages and the speed of the induction machine as the inputs to the parameter estimator. The experimental results obtained compare the estimated parameters with the induction machine parameters achieved using traditional tests such as the DC, no-load and locked-rotor tests. There is also a comparison of the solution quality between a genetic algorithm (GA), standard PSO and chaos PSO. The results show that the chaos PSO is better than the GA and standard PSO for parameter estimation of the induction machine.",

        "abstract": "The paper deals with control methodologies of power electronic transformers (PET) which include a single-phase medium-frequency (MF) electromagnetic transformer. Reference is made to a PET configuration having dc-links either in high-voltage or in low-voltage sides. Both primary and secondary windings of the ferrite-core transformer are supplied by a voltage-source-inverter (VSI, on high-voltage side) and by a voltage-source-rectifier (VSR, on low-voltage side) which impose square-wave voltages. The proposed control strategy has the aim to define the optimised delay between primary and secondary voltages which allows us to obtain the power instantaneously demanded by the load, ensuring fast dynamic response and maximization of the power/current ratio. The control algorithm is based on algebraic equations derived from the mathematical model of the considered system by means of proper simplifications. The used predictive technique gives good results also in four quadrants operations. An application to a traction drive is analyzed.",

        "abstract": "Multiphase drives have advantages in high power transport applications, because of their inherent fault tolerance. It takes only two phases to create a fundamental mmf distribution rotating at the supply frequency, so a machine with m phases can continue to operate at reduced power in a controlled manner, with m-2 phases open circuit. However, if the faulty motor is represented by a reduced-order model, a different control structure is required for each combination of loss of phases, with careful matching of initial conditions in the controller at the onset of the fault. This paper retains the full-order motor model, but imposes additional constraints within the control to account for the zero current in the open-circuit phases, giving a single, unified control. Simulation results present strategies for detecting and responding to the onset of the fault. Simulation and experimental results are shown pre-and post-fault, for a six-phase machine.",

        "abstract": "The AC 25 kV electric railways with DC drive locomotives are one of the main harmonic pollution sources of electric power grids in China. To assess the power quality of the railway supply networks needs to model not only the fundamental currents of the trains but also their harmonic contents. It is difficult to simulate accurately the dynamic current waveforms of an electric locomotive running on real lines because there are too many random or uncontrolled factors that can intervene the working state of the main power circuit of the locomotive. This paper presents a modelling method which can be used to imitate the probabilistic property of the current waveform and can be embedded in the train simulator. This method is based on statistical analysis of a large amount of measured data of locomotive currents that were acquired on actual railway line. A computer program has been developed for the 8K locomotive, a kind of widely used locomotives for freight services in China. The program has been applied to assess the power quality of railway power supply utilities, which shows that this modelling method can give a very realistic result from the statistics point of view and has a fast speed in the simulation.",

To search for the new type of antenna for UHF tag, this paper presents a new slot antenna for UHF tag. The characteristic cure of the impedance of the slot antenna is smooth along with the frequency. The antenna is easily matched with the UHF tag chip. The matched result at the 915MHz shows that the performance of the slot antenna is better than the traditional tag antenna. A slot antenna for UHF tag has been fabricated, and the reading distance has been measured with the compatible reader. The result of measurement shows that the slot antenna can basically meet the needs of UHF tag.",

        "abstract": "The phenomenon this paper looks at is power swings, voltage collapse, series compensation and the effect of shunt active VAR compensation. Power swing blocking although a well established technique in its own right; is hampered by traditional detection methods which can be compromised when the system topology changes. Voltage collapse (insufficient VARS) and its effect on distance protection is not a subject which has had wide spread discussion. Fast and slow VAR compensation devices like SVC's and STATCOM bring in new challenges to this traditional art. Series compensation is also being considered on relatively short lines in order to export more power through existing corridors and has implications on distance reach as well as directionality.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new design for a low cost, low complexity phased array. The proposed design allows control of the phase progression in the entire phased array by using only two phase shifters. As a result, cost and complexity of the phased arrays based on this approach can be significantly reduced. The proposed phased array is composed of directional couplers, amplifying stages, power combiners and two phase shifters. The phase shifters are simple and compact consisting of varactor diodes and inductors. As proof-of-principle, a 2 GHz eight-element phased array with an approximate scan angle of 25 degrees is presented.",

A number of approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem of automatic web service composition. Most of them are inspired by the researches in AI planning. As heuristics plays a key role in the promotion of planning efficiency, the selection of heuristic mechanism is very important. In this paper, we propose the conception of composition distance, and propose a heuristic bidirectional search algorithm based on composition distance. The most contribution of this paper is: (1)propose the conception of composition distance: (2)a heuristic bidirectional search algorithm. The algorithm we proposed is effective and efficiency when applied in web service composition engine.",

This paper presents the development of a protection and voltage control strategy for DFIG wind turbines, which enhances the fault ride-through capability of DFIG wind turbines and their ability to provide voltage control during grid faults. The performance of the proposed protection and voltage control strategy is assessed through the simulations of a 2 MW DFIG wind farm. To protect the rotor side converter, a crowbar at the rotor is switched on. The performance of an active crowbar during voltage dips is investigated for several parameter sets of machine, resistor and control.",

        "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where the battery supply is extremely limited, reduction in transmission is necessary for lengthening the life span of the networks. However, the QoS of transmission is always impaired when data aggregation mechanisms are applied. In this article, we put forward a new approach-Adaptive Data Aggregation Mechanism (ADAM) to solve this dilemma, based on a unique characteristic in WSNs on LEACH protocol: the resemblance of data sent from neighboring nodes. Adopting ADAM, the cluster head examines the statistical characters of packets received from surrounding nodes to achieve the optimal aggregation parameters, breaks the data into blocks and then use a shorter data pattern to represent repeating blocks in transmission so as to minimize inter-node level redundancy. At the sink, applying the inverse-operation, the original information can be totally recovered. The specific message formats, the algorithm and the parameters such as frame size and block size are devised and tested in the following passages. And from the simulation, we prove the effectiveness of ADAM in realizing data fusion with remarkable compression ratio and thus expanding the lift-time of the networks.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents the design procedure and modeling of performance for a special coupled electromechanical system, for use in sea wave energy extraction applications. The electromechanical system is consisted of a linear permanent magnet generator (LPMG), combined with a cylindrical floating buoy moving due to the sea wave incidence. The basic advantage using LPMG for sea wave energy extraction applications is that the generator exploits directly the vertical movement of the incident sea wave. In such a case, the linear generator is directly coupled with a vertical cylindrical buoy in heave. This topology involves a lighter and simpler mechanical system, in comparison with a complex system that converts the vertical linear movement of the sea wave to rotation, in case that a rotating generator is used. In order to efficiently exploit the wave energy using a point absorber like a floating buoy, it is important to tune the movement of the coupled mechanism, with the main frequency of the incident wave by using appropriate control. The system analysis requires particularly developed electromagnetic mechanical hydraulic simulation models for the time variation representation of the system's operational parameters.",

It is assumed that the moving targets try to avoid the camera field of view of the aircraft by changing their velocities and/or hiding behind buildings. The number of aircraft is much smaller than the number of targets, in general. In order to track as many targets as possible, firstly the targets are grouped into a number of subgroups by maximising the modularity, which is solved efficiently by the power iteration. Secondly, circular optimal paths are assigned to maximise the visibility of the area, given shapes and locations of the ground obstacles, where the computational complexity is reduced using a novel random sampling method. Finally, the aircraft transition paths from the current positions to the desired path are obtained by solving a discrete minimum weighted path length problem.",

        "abstract": "Power quality improvement has become one of the important issues because of increasing sensitive loads. For example, dynamic voltage restoration is one of the major issues about the power quality. On the other hand, a large current caused by some system fault may be unwillingly large because of many interconnections of distributed generators. A Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) is well known apparatus, which consists of two self-commutated converters. This paper proposes a simplified power quality conditioner by replacing the shunt converter of the UPQC by two diode-bridge rectifiers. By the simplification of the UPQC, the overall system reliability is increased and installation cost is reduced. Power conditioning is provided by the series converter, while the d.c. voltage control is realized by the diode bridge rectifier. Although the active power flow through the rectifier must be only one direction, the amount of active power can be regulated by the d.c. voltage control of the series converter. In case some excessive energy is stored in the d.c. capacitor, it can be returned to the power system by an appropriate control of the series converter. In this paper, the effectiveness of the Simplified Power Quality Conditioner (SPQC) as a dynamic voltage restorer and a fault current limiter is verified by simulation.",

To solve the problems, a simplified cognitive spatial multiplexing scheme is proposed, including BS and MS systems, where MIMO BS in a cell has two antennas and each MS of lower moving speed has one antenna only. To ensure communication quality of the network, the scheme applies LDPC as the channel coding instead of space-time coding for BSs and MSs. BS assigns the same CDMA channels for MSs to have larger space interval. Simulations show that good spatial multiplexing capacity and BER performance have been achieved by the proposed scheme.",

As ADL FEC can also reduce acknowledgment frequency, it increases efficient and reduces power in the process. We validated the feasibility of ADL-FEC through our wireless sensor networks.",

It is showed by simulations that more reliable route can be discovered and the ratio of routes breakage is decreased after introducing relative mobility parameters in AODV-RM.

        "abstract": "In this paper a novel numerical algorithm for locating faults on transmission lines will be presented. The algorithm does not need the line parameters to locate the fault and can locate all fault types, which makes it very different to existing fault location methods. Line parameters are known only approximately and they differ with varying loading and weather conditions, so an algorithm that does not need them will be more accurate, robust and flexible. This will lead to more reliable fault location and faster fault rectification, helping to improve the security and quality of the energy supply. The algorithm requires synchronised data sampling from both ends of the line, this can be achieved using the emerging Synchronized Measurement Technology. As transmission lines become longer to transport energy from remote sources to load centres, series compensation has been found to be an efficient and economical means of increasing transmission line capacity and voltage stability. However, series compensation can have an adverse effect on the line's protection; therefore the aim of this paper is to develop a settings-free fault location algorithm that is unaffected by series compensation. The algorithm was rigorously tested using ATP-EMTP simulations; the results of which are presented in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Due to the advantages of higher efficiency over fixed-price trading and the ability to discover equilibrium prices quickly, auction is a popular way of trading goods. In business-to-business e-commerce (B2B), many goods with complementarities or substitutabilities are being traded using auctions. Combinatorial auctions can be applied to improve the efficiency of trading in B2B marketplaces. In combinatorial auctions, a bidder can bid on a combination of goods with one limit price for the total combination. This improves the efficiency when the procurement of one good is dependent on the acquisition of another. Most of the combinatorial auctions studied in the literature are one-sided: either multiple buyers compete for commodities sold by one seller, or, multiple sellers compete for the right to sell to one buyer. Combinatorial double auctions in which both sides submit demand or supply bids are much more efficient than several one-sided auctions combined. However, combinatorial double auctions are notoriously difficult to solve from computation point of view. In this paper, we formulate the combinatorial double auction problem and propose an algorithm for finding near optimal solutions. The algorithm is developed by decomposing the combinatorial double auction problem into several subproblems and applying the subgradient algorithm to iteratively adjust the shadow prices for the subproblems.",

To improve the encoding speed of the UMHexagonS algorithm in x264, an optimized algorithm is proposed in this paper on three aspects via the modified scheme of the threshold selection, early termination of condition and big hexagon search mode. The simulation experimentation shows that the proposed algorithms can save about 30% of search points with small video quality decline as that of UMHexagonS algorithm. And besides, as for calculation of SAD value, modified method of the COST_MV() function, reduce the numbers of unnecessary SAD calculations and save about 20% to 40% of the estimated time.",

Different from the Internet or sensor networks, IOT is based on the extension of the Internet, thus inherited both its complexity of Internet services and its complexity of structure. This article focuses on the complicated laws that gradually emerged out of IOT and describes its characteristics based on previous work done on the IOT and with the help of an analysis on wireless sensor network and Internet network. The possible impacts of these characteristics on the future development of IOT is also considered and discussed.",

        "abstract": "We present a concentrically corrugated near-field plate which can form a subwavelength near-field focus. The experimental plate consists of a coaxial aperture surrounded by non-periodic concentric corrugations. The measured subwavelength patterns are compared to those created by a coaxial probe with similar dimensions and are shown to be narrower. Excellent agreement between measurements and simulated results is observed. Finally, the frequency response of the plate is experimentally studied. The presented near-field plate will find applications in near-field probing.",

One way to do this is to use the combination of a vacuum gap, formed using standard semiconductor processing, together with capacitive or inductive signaling across the gap. Simulation shows that the DRAM can operate at a temperature 47°C cooler than the CPU.",

The new wheel motor concept and vehicle configurations are introduced and detailed control schemes are provided. The paper is mainly concerned with the development of a practical control strategy to achieve efficient and accurate delivery of tractive effort via the implementation of a field-orientated control approach for the permanent magnet motors, with a particular emphasis on the design methodology/method rather than design details. Results in all three stages of the development, i.e. modelling and simulation, in-house laboratory experiment, and on-site track full vehicle testing, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control system.",

Also, an independent control of the active and reactive power is achieved. The system under study consists of a BDFG driven by a voltage source bi-directional converter. The machine model in d-q power winding (PW) synchronously rotating reference frame is formulated in Matlab/Simulink. Both, the active and reactive control paths are implemented using Fuzzy logic controllers (FLC). Meanwhile each path includes two fuzzy logic controllers, one is used for the outer control loop and the other for the inner control loop. The dynamic performance of the BDFG has been tested when the overall system is subjected to a step change in active and reactive power respectively. The simulation results show that the FLC enhance the dynamic response of the overall system compared with conventional proportional plus integral controller. It achieves also independent control of the active and reactive power with reduced cross coupling effect.",

The electric motor technology for the drive motor has prompted considerable debate, since the optimum solution depends both on motor properties but also on technology readiness. The hardware-in-the loop emulator mimics the behaviour of the vehicle, providing a test environment to evaluate potential drive motors experimentally. Because the vehicle efficiency depends on how it is driven, standard vehicle drive cycles are used to provide benchmark comparisons. Vehicle kinematics are represented by a vehicle model, using a mechanically coupled load machine to apply the calculated model torque to the motor under test. The principles of operation of the test rig are demonstrated by comparing an industrial induction machine and permanent magnet motor in terms of energy consumption and controllability; experimental results are presented.",

        "abstract": "For indicators of relief valve's dynamic characteristics, most important things are both stability and rapid response ability. However, up to the present there is no effective design parameter to satisfy its demand. So, a pilot-operated relief valve and its dynamic experiment system's simulation model were established, by means of AMEsim software technology. Through the batch parameters simulating show that the dynamic characteristics of the relief valve are affected by the pilot control spool's diameter size, next is affected by the damper size on the main valve. Further parameter-filtrating and simulating, obtained a satisfactory dynamic curve and design parameters, its response time is 0.05 seconds, work stability, and no pressure overshoot. This measure reproduced the dynamic test methods of relief valve, and played effects of a fast and cost-saving.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a reversible data hiding method which is affine transformation invariant for 3D mesh models. The histogram shift scheme is applied to data embedding by modifying the normalized distances between the model center and vertices. When the 3D model is rotated, uniform scaled, or translated, the embedded data can be correctly extracted and the original 3D model can be reconstructed. For blind extraction of hidden data, there is only a small extra payload that should be recorded. Although the 3D model is slight changed by modifying vertex coordinates, it cannot be detected by human eyes. The experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against the rotation, uniform scaling, and translation attacks.",

        "abstract": "Over centuries the successful cooperation of foreman and assistant has been an important factor of efficiency, as the mutual understanding of each others actions and intentions facilitates a smooth work flow. Hence, a promising option in the field of automation is to develop models of intuitive and adaptive assistance. An artificial system equipped with such models could improve not only efficiency, but also acceptance and safety in human-robot interaction (HRI). As a first step towards this goal, we investigated the timing of the most common physical interaction occurring in HRI - the handing over of items. In an assembly experiment we measured the duration of the different steps. We found that a linear dependency sufficiently describes the relation between the complexity of each working step and its duration. The parameters of the linear model however largely differ between the individual subjects. This linear dependency was used to develop Kalman filters to predict durations and complexities of different assembly steps. We showed that after a short adapting phase we received an accuracy of 18.03%, comparing the predicted assembling duration to the measured duration. The model was integrated into an assistive robot system to demonstrate its robustness and low requirements of the sensory systems.",

The processor is based on mixed radix algorithm and single-path delay feedback(SDF) architecture is adopted. The configurable architecture is achieved by connecting or bypassing specific processing elements. To improve processor performance, a dynamic scaling approach is adopted and internal data is formatted as self-defined floating point, and the arithmetic for the self-defined floating point is simple. The experiment results show that the approach can achieve high and constant SNR. The processor is implemented on FPGA.",

        "abstract": "This paper outlines a scheme for compressing EEG signals based on the JPEG2000 image compression algorithm. Such a scheme could be used to compress signals in an ambulatory system, where low-power operation is important to conserve battery life; therefore, a high compression ratio is desirable to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. The JPEG2000 specification makes use of the wavelet transform, which can be efficiently implemented in embedded systems. In this research, the JPEG2000 standard was broken down to its core components and adapted for use on EEG signals with additional compression steps added. Variations on the compression architecture were tested to maximize compression ratio (CR) while minimizing reconstructed percentage root-mean- squared difference (PRD) and power requirements. Tests indicate that the algorithm performs well in efficiently compressing EEG data, without significant loss in signal fidelity.",

        "abstract": "The transmission capability of the Finnish transmission network over the main power transfer intersections is restricted by stability limits. Since the deregulation of the electricity markets started in Finland back in 1995, Fingrid as Finnish transmission system owner and operator has actively been improving the transmission capability of the Finnish transmission system in order to minimize the effect of transmission capability limitations on the functioning of the electricity markets. Without building new transmission lines over the main transmission intersections, Fingrid has been able to increase significantly the transmission capability using mainly series compensators and controllable devices but also other structural improvements of transmission network. As the main result of the investments the internal transmission capability from South to North Finland has almost tripled and from North to South Finland has nearly doubled with respect the level of the transmission capability before year 1997.",

It significantly improves the computational speed since it is only required to solve a large equation set once, which otherwise needs to be solved for each rotor position in the SD model, and the hassle of numerical iteration in the conventional CP model is removed. The investigation shows the combined model has similar high accuracy to the conventional CP and SD models for the fundamental back-EMF and average torque, and predicts similar waveforms of cogging torque, torque ripple, and back-EMF harmonics to FE, but its accuracy is lower than that of the SD model in terms of the magnitudes of back-EMF and torque ripple harmonics.",

        "abstract": "The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important physiological measurement that is critical in the diagnosis of many cardiac disorders. In this paper, the design of a wireless system for ambulatory ECG acquisition and analysis is discussed. The wireless ECG node can operate in one of two configurations, where (i) raw ECG data is continuously transmitted to a base station, or (ii) the Heart Rate (HR) is calculated on the node, and only HR data is transmitted. The power requirements of the wireless node are also analysed. Furthermore, the system design includes a complementary base station node, which can be attached via USB to the patient's PC. The system back-end is also presented, whereby patient data is uploaded to a remote server, and can be accessed by the patient's healthcare team via a secure website.",

        "abstract": "Bus arrival times are influenced by stochastic variations in number of factors, (e.g., intersection delays, traffic congestion, and weather conditions) resulting in buses to deviate from the predetermined schedule and lengthening of passenger waiting times for buses. Providing passengers with accurate bus arrival times through advanced traveler information systems can help passengers' decision making and reduce average waiting time for buses. In this paper, a set of models, predicting bus arrival times at stops along a route, are developed through mining historical data collected by automated passenger counters (APC). The data applied for developing the models were collected by APC installed on buses operated by the public transit agency in Harbin, a city of northeast region of China. The results obtained are promising, and indicate that the developed models can be used to estimate bus arrival times.",

After research on the motion trace and the force pattern, a finger-kneading manipulation model based on pain threshold was presented. On this basis, a hybrid force position control strategy was exploited to track position and force at the same time. The control strategy was simulated in MATLAB with Simulink and SimMechnics modules, and the results shows the force error is less than 0.7N and the position error is less than 0.1mm. The accuracy and effectiveness in practical application was proved by accuracy testing and clinical experiment.",

In the new algorithm, the problem of interest is first translated into multiple nonlinear single-sensor multitarget tracking problems, which can be dealt with sequentially. Then UKF is used for the propagation of state distribution in nonlinear system. Based on these ,the association of measurements of single sensor to tracks is implemented according to the principle of order statistics probabilistic data association (OSPDA) and the MSOSUPDA algorithm is derived. Compared with the MSJPDA/EKF, the accuracy and robustness of MSOSUPDA are improved. Furthermore, computational complexity of the proposed algorithm decreases obviously on account of the use of OSPDA. According to the simulation results, the ratio of divergence and the processing time of our proposed algorithm to those of the MSJPDA/EKF algorithm are 19 and 70 percent respectively besides more favorable accuracy.",

Having parameters of such systems and their responses we proceed to brief description of the radial basis function neural network and its application to the linear models' coefficients' identification. Comparative analysis of the models formulated according to those two different manners is done.",

        "abstract": "The use of multiple power sources in railway applications is common on modern rolling stock. Prime movers are usually distributed along the length of the train, and are able to provide distributed traction. If the primary power for such vehicles comes from individual diesel engines, or if there are non-linear efficiency characteristics within the drive train, then the supervisory controllers for each motive unit may be decoupled and operated independently. This can potentially save energy. This paper investigates two global optimisation algorithms. These are the dynamic programming method, and the greedy algorithm. Both of these two graphic searching algorithms help to find the optimum power distribution between engines for a typical Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) train. It is found that the application of Dijkstra's Algorithm, in association with a Fibonacci heap (F-heap) based advanced data structure, can significantly improve the computing efficiency while maintaining the same optimisation precision as the dynamic programming method. In an optimisation process with M power requirements and n possible engine power states for each requirement, the time complexity will be reduced from O(M*n2) to O(M*(n log(n) + n)).",

The system presented consists of a miniaturized projector and up to 2 Wii Remotes (Wiimotes) mounted on a helmet. After a four-point touch calibration with an infrared-pen the user can interact on a flat plane e.g. a wall, table or whiteboard. A maximum of 4 IR-pens can be used at the same time to navigate, select and manipulate objects in the projected virtual space in either 2D or 3D. Under certain light conditions it is also possible to augment virtual informations onto arbitrary flat objects. In case of tracking an IR-pen, keystone distortion can be realised by additional semi-automated user calibration. When using a whiteboard, the calibration is done automatically.",

Nevertheless, not many applications take mobility into account. An application and its communication component are tightly coupled and the applications assume that network behaviour does not change. Here in this paper we propose a new lightweight architecture consisting of a small foot-print core layer and a modularised pluggable infrastructure. The architecture presented in this paper is suitable for mobile devices and extensible to make use of abstractions to conquer heterogeneity in mobile devices. The architecture also extends connectivity of devices to access remote applications. Multiple device interfaces can be used in the same session to extend the connectivity range.",

It presents the extension of the robust control design framework, initially established for the interaction between an industrial robot and stiff environment, to novel human-robot-environment and human-robot-human-environment interactive systems with physical interfaces. This theoretical framework has been utilized for the control design of novel collaborative robot supporting complex assembly process in automotive industry developed in the PISA project. The practical design and initial application tests with a novel power collaborative developed in the PISA project are also presented in the paper.",

        "abstract": "The stopping criterion based on parity-check constraints is an inherent advantage of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. However, the parity-check computation with signs of the posterior information costs additional hardware or decoding delays, which may be a particular problem for the full-parallel LDPC decoding in optical transmission. Furthermore, the performance degradation caused by using simplified stopping criterions should also be considered, where the maximum number of the iterations is usually limited by the very high decoding speed in optical transmission. In this paper, we propose an efficient early stopping criterion with the consideration of the complexity/performance tradeoffs. The new method is based an intelligent combination of check equations and temporary hard decisions, and can be pipelined with check-node updating, thus leading to lower complexity and power consumption, which are desirable for both optical and wireless communications. Simulation results show that the hybrid criterion not only achieves the same performance as the conventional stopping criterions, but also provides a noticeable gain for the other simplified stopping criterions.",

As such, the subject can be treated in a mathematical way which deters some students. This paper describes how feedback and control can be introduced as part of a first year course, using little mathematics, accessible to students from different disciplines.",

The manipulation task is done in a daily environment rather than an artificial structured lab environment. The key feature of our method is the laser ranger mounted onto the manipulator. This approach gives the flexibility which is needed to interact in human environments. It also enables us to create a 3d point cloud of the environment. This point cloud is then segmented by the object recognition to find potential objects. The collision-free movement of the manipulator is calculated out of the objects which are provided by the object recognition. The robustness of our approach is demonstrated by an everyday scenario.",

        "abstract": "A new nonlinear control scheme suitable for dc/dc power boost converters is presented. As shown in the paper, the proposed controller is capable of regulating the converter output at the desired level independently from the kind of the load. It is proven that in both cases, i.e. of a pure resistance load and a resistance-inductance load, the controller preserves the passivity property which is a fundamental property of the open-loop system guaranteeing a satisfactory response. This is the main advantage of the proposed controller against other advanced standard techniques, such as the IDAPBC design which may fail in cases where resistance-inductance load appears. Simulation results that include comparisons with the IDA-PBC controller performance, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.",

In data transmission phase, HBRRP makes parents and siblings as forward selection; relying on a formula for evaluating the routing quality, routing mechanism has a comprehensive consideration of the forward selection; trigger update mechanism is used to maintain dynamic network topology and avoid \"routing hole\"; data packets act as a part of routing packets, which can reduce network maintenance cost. Compared with MHC, DD, join-MHC in omnet++ simulation tool, HBRRP proves its strength in load balancing, extending network lifetime, reliability and low routing overhead.",

The system can be used for many kinds of vehicles and offers high computing power and flexibility in respect of the control algorithms and additional application dependent tasks. It was originally developed to control a small quad-rotor UAV where stringent restrictions in weight and size of the hardware components exist, but has been transfered to a fixed-wing UAV and a ground vehicle for in- and outdoor search and rescue missions. The modular structure and the use of a standard PC architecture at an early stage simplifies reuse of components and fast integration of new features.",

Therefore, this article discusses the theory of using RBF neural network to identify control object, providing received Jacobian message to BP network, then using arbitrary nonlinear expression ability of BP neural network to achieve the optimum combination of PID control parameters through studying the system, and finally reaching the goal of speedy and stable control. Meanwhile, simulation comparison is made to traditional PID controller on MATLAB and Simulink, and the result shows that the PID controller based on neural networks is faster in response and better in follow nature than the traditional PID controller is.",

The proposed method uses only the three line currents measured at the relay point. The waveform pattern of phase angle and symmetrical components of the three line currents during transient period of fault condition are analyzed using conditioning rules with IF-THEN in order to determine the type of single phase to ground fault and initiate single pole auto-reclosing command or three phase reclosing command for other type of faults. The proposed method is implemented and verified in PSCAD/EMTDC power system software. The test results show that the proposed method can correctly detects the faulty phase within one cycle in power distribution network with DGs under various network operating conditions.",

It offers the possibility to combine the function of locomotion and manipulation for systems operating in difficult terrains. In this contribution the constructive characteristics and basic properties of the two mobile systems, based on compliant elements, are considered. The theoretical investigations are focused on the description of the dynamic system behaviour by transient analysis. The characteristics of the prototypes obtained by theoretical investigations using Finite-Element-Method and Multibody Systems Dynamics, are compared with experimental results.",

Future sub-array AESA architectures and multi-channel receivers will enable efficient jammer suppression by use of Adaptive Beam Forming. The technology basis of T/R-Modules will move to Gallium-Nitride, promising improvements in efficiency, output power and miniaturisation.",

        "abstract": "A technique is proposed whereby MEMS gyroscopes can be used to make accurate angular rate measurements. In this technique, signal processing techniques are used to combine the relatively inaccurate outputs of a large number of MEMS gyroscopes into a single accurate output without requiring an excessive amount of computation. First, averaging is used to combine sets of gyroscope outputs so that the effect of additive noises and noise due to parameter uncertainties is reduced. The several outputs thus formed are then combined into a single output by a dynamic element matching technique which essentially combines the noises due to random bias, white noise, and noise due to parameter uncertainties into a single measurement noise. The single output from the dynamic element matching process is sent to an extended Kalman filter for final processing. Each step of the process decreases the noise magnitudes or their effect on the accuracy of the gyroscopes; and therefore for an appropriate number of gyroscopes, a desired accuracy should be achievable. The system designer should also be able to control such additional design factors such as multiple signal `fan-in' and reliability. The technique presented in this paper is new and additional work is on-going to determine its practical value.",

Photovoltaic modules must withstand 0-100% humidity at -20°C to 100°C with voltages up to 1000 V and thousands of thermal cycles. Therefore, predicting lifetime is no better than predicting the weather. Yet lifetime estimates directly impact the levelized cost of a power generation system and therefore must be quantified. This talk will outline many of the failure modes for solar panels and the failure analysis techniques that are commonly used. Thermal and emission images are the dominate method for identifying egradation in a solar module.",

Especially Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars, with their unprecedented degree of operational flexibility, are currently about to revolutionise the performance of air- and spaceborne, naval and ground radars. The current status of AESA radar and the trends in system and technology advances are discussed. Trends on system level will be the use of MIMO-architectures and shared antenna apertures.",

        "abstract": "Information of unordered point cloud is limited because of no direct topologic relation between points or triangular facets. So it will be difficult to obtain the feature points of 3D point cloud data. In this article, we use the geometry properties, such as normal, curvature and density of the points' information to detect features of the 3D point cloud data and propose a curvature and density based feature point detection method for unordered 3D point cloud data. Firstly, we define a feature parameter of 3D point cloud data, which includes the distance with its neighboring points, the sum of the normal angle between the point and neighboring points, and point cloud data curvature. Secondly, the density of data points is calculated by using Octree and is used as the features of points by a threshold of their feature parameter. The experimental results show that our new approach might detect feature points accurately for the given 3D point cloud data.",

A compact strut design is realised by integrating a coil spring into a high force density tubular PM machine, and sensorless control of the actuation force is achieved by employing an extended Kalman filtering technique. The issues pertinent to the design of the Kalman filter are discussed, and utility and effectiveness of the sensorless operation are demonstrated by extensive simulations of the vehicle suspension system with measured real road data.",

Double-ended travelling waves fault location avoids the drawbacks of impedance method, and it makes huge significance to the high-speed electrified railway of China. Application system of this method has been put into trial operation and the results are good.",

The new algorithm selects some effective users from all the users, and then allocates the entire power among the selected users applying Water-Filling algorithm. The vector Gaussian broadcast channel and the matrix Gaussian broadcast channel are considered respectively and the corresponding user selection methods are proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the new algorithm can significantly improve the computational efficiency of the traditional iterative Water-Filling power allocation and can obtain almost the optimal sum capacity.",

After building the model of Buck circuit, the Twisting Algorithm is designed, which is based on relative degree of sliding mode control. The second order sliding mode not only reserves advantages of traditional sliding mode: robustness, but also eliminates the chattering problem. By comparing PID control with second order sliding mode control, simulation results indicate that second order sliding mode control have stronger robustness despite load disturbance.",

The steady-state analysis indicates that the CCC-HVDC scheme is superior to the HVDC link. The transient analysis shows that CCC-HVDC scheme is more robust against a single phase remote fault, and is poorer against a three phase ac fault than the HVDC link.",

        "abstract": "Laser tube bending is a process in which the laser irradiates the tube surface to induce the thermal stress and bend the tubes. As no hard tooling or external forces is needed during, laser tube bending is a flexible forming process and has potential to deal with materials difficult to bend or thin wall tubes. A formula for bending angle is proposed based on plastic mechanics and verified by experiment. It can be seen that the bending angle is as a result of laser power, laser scanning speed, tube dimension and material properties. For multi pass bending, the bending angle increases with the laser irradiation number but not linearly. The maximum value of laser power, with which the laser will melt the metal during bending, and the minimum, with which the laser can not induces plastic bending, are also proposed.",
