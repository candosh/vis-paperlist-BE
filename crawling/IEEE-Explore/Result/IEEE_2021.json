        "abstract": "Gait benchmarks empower the research community to train and evaluate high-performance gait recognition systems. Even though growing efforts have been devoted to cross-view recognition, academia is restricted by current existing databases captured in the controlled environment. In this paper, we contribute a new benchmark for Gait REcognition in the Wild (GREW). The GREW dataset is constructed from natural videos, which contains hundreds of cameras and thousands of hours streams in open systems. With tremendous manual annotations, the GREW consists of 26K identities and 128K sequences with rich attributes for unconstrained gait recognition. Moreover, we add a distractor set of over 233K sequences, making it more suitable for real-world applications. Compared with prevailing predefined cross-view datasets, the GREW has diverse and practical view variations, as well as more natural challenging factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset for gait recognition in the wild. Equipped with this benchmark, we dissect the unconstrained gait recognition problem. Representative appearance-based and model-based methods are explored, and comprehensive baselines are established. Experimental results show (1) The proposed GREW benchmark is necessary for training and evaluating gait recognizer in the wild. (2) For state-of-the-art gait recognition approaches, there is a lot of room for improvement. (3) The GREW benchmark can be used as effective pre-training for controlled gait recognition.

Generally, these plant diseases are caused by insects or pests, which reduce the production on a large scale if not restricted promptly; cotton plant leaf diseases must be identified early and accurately, as they can harm yield. Identifying and managing the disease has become a significant challenge due to the rapid growth of various diseases and a lack of adequate knowledge among farmers. The leaves have a similar texture and appearance, which helps to identify the disease type. As a result, deep learning with computer vision offers a solution. A deep learning model is trained with healthy and infected images is proposed in this paper. This model achieves its goal by classifying leaf images into different categories like healthy or diseased based on the infected patterns. The proposed method's performance is evaluated on the Cotton Disease Dataset Kaggle and the classification accuracy is achieved 97.13%, which is better than the existing state-of-the-art methods."

        "abstract": "With the power system migrating to higher renewable and higher power electronics, the power converter shall remain the grid connection during the fault occurrence for the sake of the power system stability. The synchronization instability is the main issue for the unstable operation of these grid-tied converter. The concept of the synchronization stability has been proposed to define the ability of the converter to hold on a stable operation after subjecting a large disturbance. From previous research, the current transients couples to the synchronization transients and thus worsens the stability. The feed-forward compensator in the current control can help fasten the current stabilization and decouple the converter transients from the grid, thus potentially could improve the synchronization stability. However, this aspect has not been investigated before. This paper analyses the impact of the feed-forward compensator on the synchronization stability. The simulation results in Matlab/Simulink indicate that the feed-forward compensator with a small time constant can improve the synchronization stability and in this situation, a 2nd-order converter model is effective to represent its transient response."

The K-means clustering is employed to pack DC loads into a number of clusters. Next, the minimum spanning tree (MST) is applied to the clusters in order to get the minimum length of DC conductors. Hence, by using the shortest path (SP), the closest electrical poles connected to a cluster at which the AC/DC converter is placed, are found and then, balanced by the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Finally, the AC lines connecting all poles and clusters are designed with the MST. The optimal cost of the complete AC/DC microgrid is determined for 20 years of operation."

        "abstract": "Distribution networks will come under increased loading from EV chargers. While several studies have focused on domestic charging of EVs (typically from 3 or 7kW single-phase) with the expected power peaks occurring after-work hours (from 4pm onwards), there has been less consideration of work-based EV charging at larger power levels (22kW 3–phase, 50kW DC and higher) during work hours between 9am and 4pm. Industrial employers that consume significant amounts of electrical power and control their own distribution networks have the opportunity to ease the burden on the central power system by facilitating work-based EV charging. This paper presents the results of an investigative study into expanding EV charging at a 750-acre industrial/commercial site with over 5500 employees, 6000 parking spaces, approximately 10MW of peak power consumption and 4MW of CHP generation. Load flow analysis has been performed on the 11kV distribution circuit using MATLAB/Simulink and the impact of increased load from EV charging on the thermal limits of the main transformer has been investigated using the IEC 60076–7 standard. The results show significant differences in EV charging capacity between peak winter and peak summer since the CHP plays a critical role. Recommendations are made on how best to equip future distribution systems for increased EV charging."

The need for charging based on the driving pattern of the vehicle is included in many studies of grid impact and hosting capacity. The impact of ambient temperature is however not included in such studies. The main objective of this work is to estimate the hosting capacity of a MV/LV grid considering ambient temperature variation during the EVs fleet and charging. For this purpose, a deterministic approach for hosting capacity estimation is used and the calculations are done for an existing MV/LV distribution grid in northern Sweden."

The linear market model incorporates voltage magnitudes and reactive powers, while providing a simpler formulation than the SOCP model, which enables its practical implementation. The paper provides a structured comparison of the two formulations relying on developed deterministic and statistical Monte Carlo case analyses using two distribution test systems (the Matpower 69-bus and 141-bus systems). The case analyses show that with the increasing spread of offered flexibility throughout the system, the linear formulation increasingly preserves the reliability of the computed system variables as compared to the SOCP formulation, while more lenient imposed voltage limits can improve the approximation of prices and power flows at the expense of a less accurate computation of voltage magnitudes."

Especially for battery packs with hundreds of battery cells connected in series/parallel, the aging process will be aggravated due to the difference between battery cells, leading to a limited lifetime and reliability issues. This paper introduces the concept of Smart Battery that combines advanced power electronics and artificial intelligence (AI) intending to develop a new generation of battery solutions for transportation and grid storage. The key feature for controlling the lifetime is the bypass device, a halfbridge that can control individual cell-level load management without affecting the load. An advanced AI-based lifetime controller is trained to recognize the signs of stressed battery cells and decide to insert rest time, resulting in a pulsed current operation. Finally, the following features are expected to be achieved: increased safety and reliability by fault-tolerant operation, user-controlled lifetime, and software reconfiguration for 2nd life applications. The early experimental results are promising, showing cycle lifetime extension over 50%."

A multiobjective function is formulated in order to optimize the system voltage, power factor and line losses. The uncertainties associated with demand and generation forecasting are considered in the proposed strategy by introducing a real-time operational phase.

At the core of the proposed framework is the newly proposed design of a Virtual Edge Device (VED) to control either real or simulated flexibility resources. The VED is also provided for the interchangeable use of simulated and physical components with the same coordination logic. To tackle the questions of cyber resilience and cybersecurity, not only the energy system is taken into account but also the underlying Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Therefore, the ICT components are emulated in the co-simulation and mapped by corresponding components in the laboratory. We validate the environment by simulating and analysing three different use-cases, comprising local congestion management and battery dispatch optimisation. Our tests prove that our laboratory is suitable for a future application of the analysis and development of multi-use flexibility concepts."

        "abstract": "Grid forming inverter control resulting in a voltage source behavior with retarded adjustment to changing terminal voltage and quite strict current limits of converter valves are conflicting requirements. Most of these controls operate in polar coordinates, where it is difficult to determine the voltage reduction required to limit the fault current during faults. The Direct Voltage Control is a partial grid-forming inverter control that operates in d/q-coordinates and offers an easy solution for the problem of current limitation by calculating difference voltages derived from Kirchhoff equations. The similarity of Direct Voltage Control to classical inverter control also offers the advantages that many well-known principles from classical inverter control can be applied to Direct Voltage Control, which means that Direct Voltage Control does not represent a completely new technology with its associated uncertainties. This paper discusses the extension of the Direct Voltage Control scheme to a fully grid-forming operation based on the use of a swing equation for synchronization instead of a phase-locked loop, and explains the implementation of the current limitation. To illustrate the basic behavior of the fully grid-forming Direct Voltage Control and its current limitation, implementation is simplified by an average model. Identical controller parameterizations are used in different scenarios to prove the robustness of the control."

Discrete wavelet transform and TsFresh are chosen for the pre-processing of the high-resolution data and the extraction of features. For feature selection, mutual information filtering, feature importance und sequential feature selection are tested. Special to this investigation is the use of both - highresolution waveform data (sample rate 5 kS/s) and root mean square data (20 ms). The input data were synthesized by mathematical equations. The highest score is achieved by the XGBoost classifier in combination with the LightGBM feature selector. Accuracy shows 97.71% for root mean square data and 98.96% for the high-resolution data. Furthermore, the results illustrate the dependency of the classification result on the data structure, feature extraction, feature selection and the classifier."

Critical components in a data center power distribution system are modeled for system simulations. In the modeling approach, a balance is struck between computation speed and fidelity such that useful system simulation results can be obtained for use in planning, design, and protection. The UPS model includes low short circuit current fault modes. The dual-corded load (DCL), used widely in data centers is modeled with DC link control. Transformers and chokes are modeled with saturation characteristics. Various fault scenarios have been analysed and presented. Verified system simulations in the SIMULINK modeling environment are used for fault studies to obtain protection design requirements. It is shown that system simulations with the appropriate fidelity are very useful to explore system issues and protection. Modeling the components' fault mode behaviour is critical to obtain useful results."

        "abstract": "The future spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) development are in the direction of a system that has the ability to provide high azimuth resolution while having a wide swath, which in principle become two conflicting requirements. Current state-of-the art system that has those ability is multichannel in elevation SAR, which utilize digital beamforming (DBF) technique to form several receive elevation beams and simultaneously map different range swath by the means of scan-on-receive (SCORE), and these capabilities are well demonstrated with reflector antenna architecture. However, the implementation of these advanced DBF requires a precise knowledge of actual secondary beam pattern, which is extremely hard to predict for the case of reflector antenna due to its large geometry. One of crucial effect of the imprecise knowledge of pattern, including its variation along the azimuth direction (two-dimensional pattern), is the rising of range ambiguities to intolerable level. In this paper, a novel non-deterministic approach based on blind source separation (BSS) is proposed to estimate the antenna pattern that correspond to the suppression of range ambiguities that also varied along the doppler frequency. The method will be performed on-the ground under the normal operational mode, hence, the method doesn’t cost on-board complexity. A simulated multichannel-in-elevation based on TanDEM-X image is provided as an input, and it shows a good result in suppressing range ambiguities."

Vehicle to grid (V2G) system based on price based demand response technology can charge and discharge orderly according to real time price set by distribution system operator. Aiming at V2G system, this paper proposes a cyberattack, in which attacker can tamper with the day-ahead real time price information, thus malicious manipulation electric vehicle charging or discharging behavior, and ultimately destroy the safe and reliable operation of the power grid.

That system requires an overall size smaller than 100 mum(exp 2) and ultra-low power consumption. Two different CMOS technologies have been compared, analyzing the effect of transistor down-scaling in sub-Hz range oscillators. Four CMOSbased oscillators have been tested in both 0.18 mum and 28 nm technologies. The best result is the Schmitt Trigger-based timer implemented in FD-SOI 28 nm and combined with a ten stages frequency divider that oscillates at 122.5 mHz with a reduced area of 80 mum(exp 2). The study demonstrate that the effect of transistor downscaling opens the possibility to reach a sub-Hz oscillator with both ultra-low-power and ultra-low-area consumption, so suitable for Body Dust application."

In this paper, the controller of a proposed grid forming converter will be presented. In a small power system load and fault disturbances, balanced and unbalanced, will be applied, presenting the behaviour of the proposed grid forming converter.

High-performance workloads demand heterogeneous processing, tiered memory architecture, persistent memory support, infrastructure accelerators such as smart NICs, and infrastructure processing units to meet the demands of the emerging compute landscape. Applications such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Analytics, 5G, automotive, and high-performance computing are driving significant change in infrastructure such as Cloud, Edge, and client computing. Interconnect is a key pillar in this evolving computational landscape. The recent advent of Compute Express Link (CXL), a new open standard for cache-coherent interconnect, with its memory and coherency semantics has made it possible to pool computational and memory resources at the rack level using low-latency, higher-throughput, and memorycoherent access mechanisms. CXL is adopting networking features such as multi-host connectivity, pooled memory, persistence flows, and fabric manager while keeping its low-latency load-store semantics intact. The load-store I/O interconnects such as PCI Express (PCIe) and CXL are evolving to provide efficient access mechanisms across multiple nodes with advanced atomics, acceleration, smart NICs, persistent memory support etc. In this talk we will explore how synergistic evolution across load-store interconnects and fabrics can benefit the compute infrastructure of the future."

Today there is no standard procedure for testing shields based on the use of a single-coil for generating artificial MF (MF: Magnetic Field) as is the case for high-frequency anechoic chambers. In the case of shielding for industrial frequency sources, these are generally open shields with sources of various types: 3D transformers, switch-gear, and power lines. These kinds of sources and shields are better checked if the artificial MF has all three components in space. The work proposes a methodology based on the use of a tri-axial source, capable of generating a rotating magnetic field. The supports of the coils are made using a 3D printing process. The paper presents the design steps, the analytical evaluation of the performance of the source and as an application a test of a magnetic shielding plate was presented."

However, welding errors are usually encountered during the welding process due to external factors. The detection and correct classification of these welding faults are of great importance for the reliability of the weld and the material which was welded. Traditionally, welding error detection is usually handed by visual inspection. However, visual inspection is an error-prone and slow process. In this study, an image processing and machine learning based method is proposed to automatically detect welding defects. The welded materials are divided into sub-images and each sub-image is examined for defect detection and defect type classification. The study has been examined in 2 aspects as 2-class classification and 3- class classification. As a result of the study, an average of 90% precision is obtained with Logistic Regression (LR) and 91% precision is obtained with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the 2-class classification process. As for the 3-class classification, an average of 91% precision is obtained with the LR, and 93% precision values are obtained with the SVM."

Indeed, most existing 2D-Based saliency prediction techniques for dynamic and static scene analysis consider essentially the planar projection format. Moreover, some of the well-known prediction saliency models in the literature were implemented and widely tested with specific equirectangular (ERP) and cubemap (CMP) projections in order to track visual attention in 360° videos, using head-mounted displays (HMDs). Furthermore, the geometric difference between the two spaces raises a critical bound, on the performance of 2D models adapted to 360° data using some ERP and CMP projection methods. The main issue is the merging of 2D saliency probability distributions of some ERP and CMP projections to deal with the saliency prediction in 360° videos. Our framework can integrate new 2D saliency models without requiring any adaptation of the existing prediction algorithm. Our experiments on Salient-360 data sets show that the proposed framework integrating the 2D-based models in Omnidirectional saliency prediction is competitive with the state-of-the-art, at the head and eye movement saliency prediction."

        "abstract": "The one apparent nature of the distribution system is the size of the network. It is not uncommon to see that a single feeder extends over 1000 in terms of the electrical node counts. Furthermore, the configuration of the system is usually more complex than the usual transmission level system. Often transmission system studies assume three-phase balanced systems. Subsequently, such an assumption simplifies the subject of the study into a positive sequence equivalent network. However, such a convenient abstraction and simplification cannot be applied to a typical distribution system study. Consequently, modeling and simulation become more complicated, requiring a higher level of effort. This paper proposes a method to bridge between one of the widely used distribution system study software named OpenDSS and a real-time EMT (Electro-Magnetic Transient) level simulation environment named RTDS. The effectiveness of the proposed method is presented by two example circuit simulations, one representing a trivial circuit for the purpose of proof of concept and the other circuit representing a more realistic distribution system. One expected benefit is that a real hardware test would be able to extend the exposure of a real-world DUT (Device Under Test) and its subsequent impact on the network to a wider range of system dynamics, both from the OpenDSS and RTDS."

        "abstract": "The growing uptake of residential photovoltaic (PV) systems is driving the need for distribution companies to estimate voltage rise issues in low voltage (LV) networks, for both operational and planning purposes. Operationally, voltage calculations can help determining specific settings (e.g., PV curtailment). In planning, voltage calculations can be used to determine the PV hosting capacity of a given LV network. However, voltage calculations are normally based on power flow analyses and, therefore, require detailed three-phase electrical models which are not readily available for most distribution companies. Taking advantage of smart meters, this paper proposes an approach to calculate voltages without electrical models by capturing the nonlinear relationships among the historical data (demand and voltages) and the corresponding LV feeder using a Neural Network (with one hidden layer). Using cross-validation to determine the most suitable hyperparameters and a realistic Australian LV feeder with 31 single-phase customers, results demonstrate that the approach is very promising as it can accurately calculate voltages for unseen PV scenarios. This approach can make it possible for distribution companies to bypass the time-consuming process of producing LV network models and carry out accurate voltage calculations for any type of what-if scenarios involving PV, batteries, electric vehicles, etc."

        "abstract": "This paper presents two comprehensive large-scale distribution test systems, called SKED1 and SKED2, which are part of Iran's medium voltage electricity network. They have many new features than previous test cases. The systems comprise unbalanced loads, many feeders, many tie switches, renewable distributed generations, and various load sectors. Moreover, reliability data, harmonic data, and daily load profile are available. The previous test cases need to be modified by researchers in different analyses, whereas most of the distribution system analyses may be performed by using the proposed systems. Furthermore, they have sufficient capabilities to evaluate different optimisation-based methods for distribution systems. The main features of the systems along with some of the results obtained by the power flow and reliability analyses are described in the paper."

In this work, we benchmark the downlink throughput of the OAI 5G NR system at the physical layer. We describe the test setup and challenges involved in collecting measurements in a laboratory environment. The test setup comprises a base station (gNodeB or gNB) and a user equipment (UE) in three different connection modes: a simulator mode, where the baseband IQ samples are transmitted over a simulated channel and are made available to the UE for further processing; a cable-connected mode where the baseband IQ samples are carrier frequency shifted and transmitted over an RF cable to the UE; and finally with over-the-air transmission using antennas. The experiments are performed using the OAI 5G NR protocol stack in the PHY-TEST mode and USRP X310 hardware. The results reveal insights into the dependence of the throughput on radio configuration parameters such as the modulation and coding scheme, resource block size, number of scheduled slots, the transmit and receive gains, etc. A good match is observed between the theoretical transmission rate calculated using 3GPP standards and the measured throughput in all the connection modes that have been considered, provided the system parameters are chosen judiciously and the CPU is able to support real-time data processing."

High-resolution, interconnected grid models are therefore required for detailed investigations of current and future threats like temporary overvoltages. Here we present an approach to produce and combine synthetic high voltage (HV) and medium voltage (MV) grid models based on the actual supply task of German grids. The supply task can be inferred by open data approaches, e.g., high spatial satellite data and register databases. The resulting grids reproduce local characteristics and can form a basis for grid stability studies."

Among the available CiM implementations, this study focuses on the Logic-in-Memory (LiM) solutions, i.e., digital operations to accelerate Boolean Logic.

It is difficult to guarantee that the active power of tie lines is equal to their dispatching plan by calculating the power flow distribution in the whole network. Therefore, a partition control method of power balance of multi.provincial grid with high penetration of renewable energy is proposed. Due to multiple load deviation adjustments and AC power flow calculation of each province, the active power of tie lines can be ensured to be equal to their dispatching plan. The proposed method is composed of two sectors: distribution method of load deviation of each province with a high proportion of renewable energy, in which the balanced relationship of power generation and consumption of each province is established; accurate estimation method of transmission loss of each province under the future operation mode based on prediction and correction, in which the calculation error of unbalance caused by the estimation error of transmission loss can be further reduced. A case study based on an actual multi.provincial grid demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The benefits of using IEEE 802.11r and optimising scanning parameters are determined. It was found that optimising channel-related scanning parameters significantly reduces latency at the 99.9%-ile, whereas IEEE 802.11r shows improvements to a lesser degree on loaded networks.

Internet of Things (IoT) aims to enable a world where physical objects, integrated into information networks, provide smart services for human beings. The introduction of edge computing in IoT can reduce the decision-making latency, save bandwidth resources, and extend the cloud services to be distributed at the edge of the network. However, edge-based IoT systems currently faces challenges in their decentralized trust management. Trust management plays an essential role for reliable data fusion and mining, provisioning of services with context-awareness, and enhanced user privacy and information security. In this talk, we analyze the edge-based IoT architectures that are available in the literature. Then, a comprehensive review of trust requirements in edge-enabled IoT systems is presented. We notably discuss about blockchain as a key enabler to address many trust related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and edge computing. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of trusted edge computing based IoT systems' performance and recommend promising research directions for future investigations. "

In this paper, we study the performance of SW-HBF in a wideband multicarrier MIMO communication system considering the beam squint effect. We aim at designing the switch-based combiner that maximizes the system spectral efficiency (SE). However, the design problem is challenging because the analog combing matrix elements are binary variables. To overcome this, we propose tabu search-based (TS) SW-HBF schemes that can attain nearoptimal performance with reasonable computational complexity. Furthermore, we compare the total power consumption and energy efficiency (EE) of the SW-HBF architecture to those of the phase-shifter-based hybrid beamforming (PS-HBF) architecture. Numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently find near-optimal solutions. Moreover, the SW-HBF scheme can significantly mitigate the beam squint effect and is less affected by the number of subcarriers than PS-HBF. It also provides improved SE and EE performance compared to PS-HBF schemes."

GFL IBR converter control approach requires an important share of synchronous generation in the system to operate stably. Industry trends show more frequent conditions with fewer synchronous machines committed and higher penetration of GFL IBRs. These operating conditions pose increasing fast dynamics stability risks in the bulk system. A number of mitigations are being considered to address these concerns. One of them is “grid forming” (GFM) inverter and system technology. GFM IBRs have the potential to achieve stable voltage and frequency in grids with low or even no synchronous generation. The goal of this paper is to describe real-life implementation experience of GFM Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and other studies of GFM technology, with a focus on differences and similarities with GFL IBRs."

Here, in particular, the provision of reserve from supermarket refrigeration sys-tems is presented, whereby a sufficiently large and diverse fleet of supermarkets are simulated and aggregated to system level. The all-island power system of Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland, with a horizon of 2030, is considered as a representative study system. The impact of utilising supermarket refrigeration systems as demand response providers (as part of system scheduling), and the (maximum) rate of change of frequency following system disturbances (as part of frequency stability analysis), are investigated. Three distinct frequency control methods are provided showing that supermarkets are capable of fast frequency response services to the grid, considering their high power and energy density."

Most devices redirect the voice recordings to a central server, which uses them for upgrading the recognizer model. This leads to major privacy concerns, since private data could be misused by the server or third parties. Federated learning is a decentralized optimization strategy that has been proposed to address such concerns. Utilizing this approach, private data is used for on-device training. Afterwards, updated model parameters are sent to the server to improve the global model, which is redistributed to the clients. In this work, we implement federated learning for speech recognition in a hybrid and an end-toend model. We discuss the outcomes of these systems, which both show great similarities and only small improvements, pointing to a need for a deeper understanding of federated learning for speech recognition."

To maintain secure operations in the emerging threat landscape, detecting and implementing countermeasures against cyberattacks are paramount. However, due to the lack of publicly available attack data against Smart Grids (SGs) for countermeasure development, simulation-based data generation approaches offer the potential to provide the needed data foundation. Therefore, our proposed approach provides flexible and scalable replication of multi-staged cyber-attacks in an SG Co-Simulation Environment (COSE). The COSE consists of an energy grid simulator, simulators for Operation Technology (OT) devices, and a network emulator for realistic IT process networks. Focusing on defensive and offensive use cases in COSE, our simulated attacker can perform network scans, find vulnerabilities, exploit them, gain administrative privileges, and execute malicious commands on OT devices. As an exemplary countermeasure, we present a built-in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that analyzes generated network traffic using anomaly detection with Machine Learning (ML) approaches. In this work, we provide an overview of the SG COSE, present a multi-stage attack model with the potential to disrupt grid operations, and show exemplary performance evaluations of the IDS in specific scenarios."

The generic discussion is accompanied by a case study comparing the value of wave, wind and solar power using time series data for production and prices generated by grid and market simulations. The study has shown that simplified common-practise approaches (which do not consider correlation) fail to correctly reveal the market value of electricity production. It has also been shown that wave power can achieve a market value that is significantly higher than wind and slightly higher than solar. These differences in market value have been explained through correlation between electricity production and price, which is different for different energy sources. The study has identified competitive advantages of wave power towards the dominant sustainable energy sources, that need to be taken into account when competitiveness and profitability are to be assessed."

        "abstract": "Recently, battery energy storage (BES) has emerged as an economically viable technology to be adopted in large-scale photovoltaic (PV) and wind farms to facilitate their integration into the system and increase their economic value. This paper focuses on the determining a proper BES for such a system that will enable the system to respond to the power price variations and thus maximize the BES benefits. Additionally, this paper proposes a detailed dispatching scheme that can handle various operation constraints in order to maximize the BES benefits. This paper also takes into account the factors affecting the degradation of BES during its operation and shows that this is a critical factor in determining economic viability of the BES. A case study for a 300 MW solar power plant is given to illustrate the proposed method and assess the economic viability of the storage for this case. The results show the importance of adopting a detailed BES model to improve the accuracy of the estimated economic benefits."

        "abstract": "The optimal operation of electrical energy systems by solving a security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) problem is still a challenging research aspect. Especially, for conventional optimization methods like sequential quadratic constrained quadratic programming (SQCQP) the formulation of the incremental control variables like in-phase and quadrature voltage controlled transformers in a solver suitable way is complex. Compared to this, the implementation of these control variables within heuristic approaches like the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is simple but problem specific adaptations of the classic PSO algorithm are necessary to avoid an unfortunate swarm behavior and local convergence in bad results. The objective of this paper is to introduce a SQCQP and a modified PSO approach in detail to solve the SCOPF problem adequately under consideration of flexible incremental in-phase and quadrature transformers tap sets and to compare and benchmark the results of both approaches for an adapted IEEE 118-bus system. The casestudy shows that both approaches lead to suitable results of the SCOPF with individual advantages of the SQCQP concerning the quality and the reproducibility of the results while the PSO lead to faster solutions when the complexity of the investigation scenario increases."

        "abstract": "Variable-speed drive (VSD) systems should feature high power density and low installation costs, offer wide input and/or output voltage/motor speed ranges and ensure low EMI without requiring shielded motor cables. Accordingly, next-generation high-switching-frequency SiC/GaN PWM inverters should integrate LC output filters and generate continuous output voltages to prevent conducted or radiated EMI, reflections on long motor cables, high-frequency motor losses, dv/dt-related motor insulation stresses and bearing currents, such that conventional low-cost motor technology can be utilized. This short paper complements a keynote presentation and briefly describes new three-phase buck-boost PWM inverter topologies with sinusoidal output voltages currently under research at the Power Electronic Systems Laboratory of ETH Zürich. First, a new phase-modular buck-boost inverter concept (Y-inverter) is introduced and subsequently condensed into a three-phase current DC-link DC/AC converter that employs an input-side single-bridgeleg voltage-to-current DC/DC conversion. Next, the four-quadrant switches of the converter’s DC/AC stage, formed by common-source connection of conventional unipolar power MOSFETs, are replaced with novel dual-gate monolithic bidirectional GaN switches with bipolar voltage blocking capability and small chip area. The implementation of the resulting buck-boost DC/AC converter requires only a single low-volume magnetic component and allows a seamless extension to three-phase AC/AC operation. Thus, the converter concept has to be seen as potential competitor to state-of-the-art voltage DC-link converter systems for future industry applications and even as preferred choice over AC/AC matrix converters which show a higher output voltage filtering effort."

In this paper a three-phase DSSE is performed for a real low-voltage system in Germany. The accuracy of the DSSE is evaluated based on the differences between the measurements and estimation results. Different measurement configurations are analysed, in order to determine a minimal measurement effort required for a given accuracy. Additionally, the optimal placement of new measurement devices is investigated. The results show that the performed DSSE is accurate enough to judge whether the operation of an unmeshed low-voltage system is within its thresholds or not."

Converter is an important link between renewable energy and power grid, in which phase locked loop (PLL) can track the phase angle and frequency of power grid. At present, the influence of PLL parameters on system stability is often studied. With the increase of PLL bandwidth, the frequency range of converter negative damping increases, and the system is prone to broadband oscillation. This paper further studies the influence of the coupling between PLL and the steady-state operation point. The converter admittance can be divided into two parts. One part is only related to the converter circuit and control, and the other affected by the interaction of PLL and the operation point. Then, the system stability is analysed according to the generalized Nyquist criterion (GNC), and the grid impedances and converter power levels required for the system stability are given. The research can provide reference for field test and operation."

This comprises not only AC charging stations, but increasingly also DC charging stations, which have a much higher rated power and are therefore also known as fast charging stations. While there are already many studies about the impact of AC charging on power quality (PQ) parameters, not so much is known yet about the emission characteristic of fast chargers. Therefore, this paper presents the measurement results of 20 different chargers, most of them fast chargers, which were obtained in China as well as in Germany. The focus is put on both the harmonic emission including an assessment against the respective limits and the supraharmonic emission in the frequency range between 10 kHz and 50 kHz. The chargers of both countries are thereby compared with each other."

First the elementary capacitances are simulated thanks to 2D electrostatic finite element method (FEM), then an energetic approach is used to compute the global stray capacitance. Experimental verification has been performed on a nanocrystalline ring core. Relative error to the measurement shows that the proposed model improves the accuracy, notably by properly taking into account spaces between turns and between turns and core."

There is a common fear that the new technology could introduce message delays and fail to deliver of trip messages amongst other issues. However, one of the main advantages of devices with this technology is an improved diagnostic capability and the possibility to create contingency operation strategies. Considering a traditional substation, there are conditions that could result in outage and are not expected to be identified by the system (e.g. closing permission short-circuited by a dead rat, or during maintenance the cable responsible for blocking a signal was not reconnected). Those conditions could cause circuit-breakers to be successfully commanded closed when it should be blocked, or prevent trips and commands from being executed. However, the digital communication between protection IEDs have advanced diagnostic capabilities that can be used to increase the availability of the protection and control system. This paper focus on two aspects of LAN-integrated protection systems: describing similarities between traditional and process-bus-based protection and ensuring the detection of communication loss to maximize dependability."

Those interactions can hardly be detected by formal checks and are usually treated in review processes or by lengthy design iterations. An automated way for identifying potentially harmful regions is still missing. This contribution introduces AnoPCB, a tool for automated detection of such potentially harmful regions. Due to the lack of pre-classified data and tremendous potential for bad design choices, AnoPCB is designed as unsupervised method and detects deviations from well-known design practices. In addition, we made AnoPCB freely-available as plugin for the open-source KiCad PCB design environment. Instead of using top-down imagery, AnoPCB processes geometrical relationships and signal properties in terms of layout slices containing category-based signal annotations. After training the anomaly detection on wellfunctional PCB layouts, our system is able to identify novel and potentially anomalous design patterns in new PCB layouts. We demonstrate our approach using freely available PCB layouts from the HackRF projects and showcase how novel design patterns are detected by AnoPCB."

The proposed solution aims to use execution trace to do the required mapping. The developer first uses a scenario to exercise a feature to generate the required execution trace. Second, the developer formulates a text query to describe the feature of interest in a natural language, to retrieve and rank the relevant methods from the generated execution trace. Distance software metrics are proposed to measure the distance between the raked methods.

To evaluate the inertial support and the resulting influence on the ac grid dynamics, the active power flowing in the link, the rate of change of frequency, and the frequency nadir of the ac grid are analysed. A time-domain sensitivity analysis is carried to show the effect of the VSM parameters on the power, frequency support and impact of converter saturation limits. The results demonstrate an improvement in the frequency behaviour of the ac grid dependent on the selection of the VSM parameters."

This cost effective, efficient method of cleaning the water surface will collect the wastes through Conveyor Belt mechanism and deposit them in a container. Algae and Duckweed being difficult to collect are pushed to the edges of the water bodies by the help of the same robot. Constant monitoring of the wastes is done with the help of the camera module which also helps in navigation. Water propellers help the robot to drive and hence collect wastes. Monitoring of the camera and movement of the robot to collect wastes is done using an Android application with the help of Bluetooth Module. Three DC motors are used in the project two for the propellers and one for the conveyor belt. The entire structure of the robot is made with the help of recyclable plastics and waste materials.

Both 5G non-stand-alone (NSA) and 5G stand-alone (SA) network architectures can be employed as part of wide area networks, but also as non-public networks which are also referred to as campus networks. These campus networks cover a restricted area, operate in dedicated spectrum, and thus can provide high reliability and data privacy to address the needs of industrial automation. In this paper, we introduce flexible 5G NSA and SA campus network testbeds that fit into a portable container. The testbeds consist only of commercial off-the-shelf hardware. The introduced testbeds are standard-conform, robust, and transparent, and can thus be readily reproduced with generally available resources following the blueprint provided by this article. The described 5G campus network testbeds thus enable network performance testing for a wide range of 5G NSA and 5G SA wireless communication settings, whereby the described 5G NSA testbed is also able to serve the 4th generation of cellular networks. We outline the wide scope of tests and measurements that are enabled by the introduced testbeds, including tests of the feasibility of satisfying industrial communication requirements with 5G campus networks."

        "abstract": "To achieve net-zero emissions in air transport industry with defined CO2 mitigation objectives in “Flightpath 2050”, electrically powered aircraft as part of electrified aviation become attractive technologies. In recent years, many electric aircraft prototypes for short-haul commuting air transport have been designed. Most of them are supposed to be deployed in the real airports by 2030 - 2035. However, the ground power systems and associated electric aircraft charging operation are also essential for realising electrified aviation. Moreover, various renewable generation technologies in terms of PVs and micro wind turbines, electric vehicles and energy storage systems are expected to be integrated into the airport to form a decarbonised microgrid energy system. Therefore, there is a challenge of designing airport microgrids associated with energy scheduling algorithms for electric aircraft charging as well as airport decarbonisation. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-agent real-time microgrid energy scheduling solution for electrified air transport. The coordination algorithm between the electric aircraft charging system and the electric vehicles charging in the airport parking lot is developed to enhance the resilience and operational flexibility of the airport microgrid. The stochastic behaviours of the airport passengers and renewable power generation are integrated into the airport microgrid energy management solution. The study shows that the airport microgrid can achieve the resilience through the proposed energy management solution."

        "abstract": "Unsupervised blind source separation methods do not require a training phase and thus cannot suffer from a train-test mismatch, which is a common concern in neural network based source separation. The unsupervised techniques can be categorized in two classes, those building upon the sparsity of speech in the Short-Time Fourier transform domain and those exploiting non- Gaussianity or non-stationarity of the source signals. In this contribution, spatial mixture models which fall in the first category and independent vector analysis (IVA) as a representative of the second category are compared w.r.t. their separation performance and the performance of a downstream speech recognizer on a reverberant dataset of reasonable size. Furthermore, we introduce a serial concatenation of the two, where the result of the mixture model serves as initialization of IVA, which achieves significantly better WER performance than each algorithm individually and even approaches the performance of a much more complex neural network based technique."

        "abstract": "DC collection systems have been suggested to improve the cost-effectiveness of offshore wind farms but no consensus currently exists on which configurations are the most promising. This paper aims to determine the primary DC wind farm candidates for commercialisation based on cost-effectiveness and technological risk. A systematic review was performed of the literature that formally assesses the cost, losses or reliability of DC wind farm configurations. The optimal configurations were found to be dependent on the methodology and assumptions used by each study, as well as the individual wind farm characteristics. Series and series-parallel DC designs without offshore platform performed well in terms of costs, but have challenges in operation and reliability that limit the short-term opportunity for commercialisation. The standard DC parallel topology has the lowest technological risk, but the mean cost reported in the literature is similar to that of AC topologies. Standard parallel DC wind farms are the primary candidate for the first commercial DC wind farm demonstrators, but the optimal design will likely need to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Guidelines for this assessment are provided."

The major source of these resonances in LV networks is the distributed power electronic (PE) devices, particularly the modern PE-based household equipment. To investigate the effect of such an increasing trend in modern PE household devices, this paper studies the impact of different realistic combinations of common household appliances. These combinations take different evolution stages of PE into account reflecting the past, present and future and load demand at the fundamental frequency. Equivalent circuits derived based on laboratory measurements carried out on typical household load scenarios were used in residential LV network simulation models. Based on the results it can be seen that the increased usage of PE-based devices and replacement of passive household equipment increases the probability of harmonic resonance in residential LV networks."

        "abstract": "Until now, the textbook example of voltage source behavior along with the provision of inertia is the behavior of the synchronous generator (SG). This can be explained by the historical success of large scale electrification with AC power systems, which is closely linked to the SG. Therefore, previously SG-based electrical power systems face significant challenges due to the shift towards renewable energy sources (RES). Being generally converter-based, these do not provide essential stabilizing properties as SG do. Consequently, beyond a certain share of this kind of generation, interconnected power system stability is at stake. If, on the other hand, the previous paradigm of converter control is changed, then system operation without any SG is possible. To this end, the converters have to exhibit essential voltage source properties as SG do. Such converters are then referred to as grid-forming converters (GFC). However, the dynamic behavior of GFC is not defined by physical properties as in the case of SG. It is defined by the grid-forming control concept only, providing a high degree of freedom for possible implementations. Taking advantage of this freedom, a wide range of different, but partly also similar or even equivalent grid-forming control concepts have been developed in recent years. Therefore, in this paper, ten of today's most discussed control concepts are compared. In this comparison, unique features, similarities and equivalences of the control concepts are shown. The focus is on the instantaneous and stationary behavior of the control concepts, which is analysed by means of a systemtheoretical and simulative analysis. The insights gained from this comparison can be helpful for the functional specification, development and improvement of GFC, as the variety of control concepts can be better understood."

Crop yield prediction is required, mainly in countries like India, which rely on agriculture as their prime source of economy. Many developments are required in the agriculture field to increase changes in our Indian economy. One of the major advancements is to implement machine learning in agriculture. Crop yield estimation helps farmers to decide about the crop in the initial stages of agriculture. Machine learning based techniques help for accurate crop yield prediction. The rapid progress in remote sensing technologies and machine learning techniques will give cost-efficient approaches for better crop yield prediction. We used a dataset from a government site for our study in this paper. In this work, using the KNN algorithm an accurate Crop Yield Prediction System (CYPS) is implemented. While for a farmer, predicting yield needs to be more accurate based on various features which could affect yield production and quality. Three factors that affect yield production include season, crop type, and area of production, so to predict the yield production, we are using certain fields like region, year, crop, season, area in our work. Accurate information about the history of crop yield is a crucial thing in creating decisions associated with agricultural risk management."

And to produce the vertical and lateral velocities, the small thrust variations of both side rotors and the lateral angle variation of thrust vector of right side rotor are used. Basically this flight control system consists of pitch and roll rate feedbacks as stability augmentation method, and P/PI control as controllability augmentation method."

In order to reduce the antenna size a 60 GHz low complexity non-coherent transceiver architecture is proposed, employing on-off keying. Since operation at 60 GHz has high power demands, the concept of aggressive duty-cycling is investigated in order to reduce the average power consumption. Limits of the introduced approach are evaluated by discussing the relations between data rate, average power consumption and necessary on-times of transmitter and receiver. We show that the proposed concept permits a transceiver power consumption of 1mW at a data rate of 1 Mbps."

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things is the most popular technology in today's society. The domain that encompasses the fields in which IoT is applied is extremely large. Security, on the other hand, is a major stumbling block for IoT. Machine-to-machine communication is at the core of the Internet of Things. A machine collects data, analyzes it, and then instructs another machine to take action as a result of the analysis. The data that these machines collect can be sensitive and private. As a result, security at each layer of the IoT is essential, as a security breach might have serious effects. For example, if the security of the very first layer, the physical layer, is hacked, the entire idea of IoT puts the privacy of the people or organizations whose data is being collected at risk. So, in order to secure the physical layer of IoT, this study suggests various realistic, low-cost, and security-enhancing approaches. Data encryption is essential to protect security of data by using a secret key to declare it unreadable and unmodified. The current study concentrates the challenges on encryption in general. To achieve this objective, a secure technique is presented at the physical layer, which provides cryptographic properties for usage in tandem with an adaptive RC6 encryption/decryption strategy written in VHDL addressing security and performance difficulties. The proposed work appeared to be an appropriate choice for practical implementation for secure data transmission at physical layer. The results of experiments verified that the proposed method is accurate. Furthermore, the ciphertexts generated by the proposed technique succeeded the tests, verifying the ciphertext's unpredictability. The output in the form of cipher text is reversed back for verification to check whether it generates same plain text to check authentication and security of used encryption/decryption technique. Future research to improve the robustness and pervasiveness of IoT-based physical layer security is also discussed."

This paper focuses on reviewing the existing literature related to object detection systems in Autonomous Vehicle.

The proposed object detection system for AV can detect, classify, and localize each object in its appropriate class by using a set of cameras, radars, Lidar, GPS/INS sensors, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and advanced Computer Vision. The object detection for AV is achieved in five steps that include perception, data process, objects behavior and understanding, sensor fusion, and acting. The proposed system is also compared with the current object detection systems for AV for its reliability and robustness. The proposed object detection system is expected to overcome the current object detection systems for AV because of its ability to classify and detect the type and behavior of the objects on the road, allowing the AV to navigate safely in a known and unknown environment by localizing itself even in the most challenging scenarios."

BS services need to evolve and determine how Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) can contribute to system restoration. This will require an entirely new and more complex approach to restoration. There are several technical, commercial, regulatory, and operational risks that need to be worked through and mitigated before transition into Business as Usual. These challenges are being explored in Great Britain by the Distributed ReStart innovation project. The paper is based on detailed restoration plans developed as part of the Distributed ReStart project to re-energise a distribution network under a Grid Supply Point using DERs, after a complete system blackout. The restoration plans are developed considering the practical challenges around operation and control of a system which is traditionally restored by a top-down approach. The restoration strategies are guided by extensive steady state, dynamic and transient analyses undertaken on three case study networks in SP Energy Networks (SPEN) distribution license areas."

The analysis is applied by the means of a virtual prototype which is based on an abstract instruction and register model with direct correspondence to their bit level representation. In this context, we analyzed three different openly available test suites: the RISC-V architectural testing framework, the RISC-V unit tests, and programs which are automatically generated by the RISC-V Torture test generator. We discuss their tradeoffs and show that by combining them to a unified test suite we can arrive at a 100% GPR and FPR register coverage and a 98.7% instruction type coverage."

IoT devices are being used by an increasing number of businesses because they provide new opportunities for wearable devices, home appliances, and healthcare. With all of these possibilities, the risks associated with IoT security are increasing. One of the most challenging aspects of any IoT application is device identification. Things in the IoT share and process data without the need for human interaction. As a result of their total authority, these entities must authenticate and recognize one another effectively. Failure to legitimately authenticating the IoT devices can make them vulnerable to a number of assaults such as DDoS and replay attacks. It is nearly hard to develop an effective authentication system due to the size and other characteristics of IoT. Although a lot of work has been done on this issue, the majority of these solutions rely on a centralized system. These centralized systems are segregated and incompatible with one another, making information exchange between them impossible. In addition, once a centralized authority is attacked, the user's privacy can be exposed easily. Proof of security, decentralization, and anonymity characteristics of blockchain can help address these issues. With blockchain technology applied to IoT systems, obstacles to IoT architecture development and security can be overcome. This paper, therefore, focuses on covering current advancements made in the application of blockchain for authentication in IoT. There is a lack of survey papers on the use of blockchain for authentication in IoT this paper will serve as an aide. This paper will also add to the knowledge of researchers who are interested in IoT security."

In this framework, the paper presents a model of the Sicily power generation and transmission system, including the Tyrrhenian link and two equivalent buses representing the Sardinian power network and the rest of the Continental Europe (CE) synchronous area, for both steady-state and dynamic analysis. The model is developed in Neplan and it is based on the actual structure of the Sicilian power system. The rest of the CE system is represented in the model and validated by a comparison with the large-scale dynamic model of the CE provided by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). Finally, some simulations of the Sicilian grid in future energy scenarios are presented, and the behaviour of the system is discussed considering different transient conditions."

Existing models often show limited capability to extract key time-series features for forecasting. This paper proposes an ultra-short-term wind power forecasting (4 hour-ahead) model (Attention Model) based on an encoder-decoder structure with integrated attention mechanism. Multi-head self-attention is used in the encoder, and the decoder is built by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with improved Bahdanau attention. With the attention mechanism, Attention Model can automatically extract important sequential information from the time-series historical power data, and can be explainable to some extent. Compared with other state-of-the-art models, Attention Model demonstrates improved accuracy for the first forecasting step (15 minute-ahead) by 27%∼58%, by 1%∼12% for the last step (4 hour-ahead) and 4%∼20% for 4-hour average."

The IC is designed for power throughputs up to 120W with an input voltage range of 7V - 24V and output voltages up to 50V. The converter operates at a switching frequency of 300 kHz in current mode control and is internally compensated. During low irradiance, the controller changes to pulse-frequency operation to further increase efficiency. The MPPT utilizes a delta modulator, avoiding the need for high resolution ADCs. The sense structure dynamically adjusts the MPP measurement resistance, further increasing tracking efficiency."

This paper introduces a quasi-static reduced-order VSC-grid model of a WTG and evaluates its performance for large-signal disturbances such as changes in current set points and grid short circuit ratio. The time-domain expression for a synchronous reference frame PLL is considered with its nonlinearity intact. Based on the analytical model, a V-δ mechanism is established to identify the PLL synchronisation instability events relevant to a WTG operation. Further, for PLL stable operation, a globally valid stability boundary is discussed. The complex nonlinear PLL dynamics are addressed using phase portraits, where it is shown that the results have direct implications on robust PLL gain tuning guidelines."

In this paper, we investigate advanced cyber attack tactics and techniques to exploit Ripple20 and IEC 61850 vulnerabilities through various attack vectors. The presented cyber-physical attack scenarios focus on gaining unauthorised access from pole-mounted reclosers in MV networks to the control centre and substation Operational Technology (OT) systems. Subsequently, the aforementioned vulnerabilities are exploited to maliciously disconnect embedded generation, block substation protection functionality, and cause busbar faults. We then experimentally demonstrate the impact of such advanced cyber attacks on power system operation that initiate cascading failures and cause a blackout. Recommendations and mitigation techniques for advanced cyber threats in the OT domain of distribution system operators are also provided."

Appropriate placement of IEDs in the distribution grid is crucial to guarantee high resilience, e.g. through remote monitoring, control and automation, and provide a high security of supply. In this paper, a novel approach for a cost-efficient placement of IEDs for fault location in radial distribution grids is proposed, which takes into account that IEDs might fail or are disconnected from the control system (e.g., Distribution Management System (DMS)). Genetic Algorithm is applied to solve the optimisation problem, with the objective to minimize the total annual cost, which is a compromise between the interruption costs (Cost of Energy Not Supplied), and the yearly expenses of the IEDs installed and their availability. To demonstrate the applicability, the method is tested on the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the method in supporting decision-making over different investment scenarios, and performing sensitivity analysis over IEDs' cost, taking into considerations the availability of the IEDs in a DMS."

In this paper, based on the economics of grid-connected WTS and the technical advantages of the WTS and ESS, respectively. A frequency trajectory planning (FTP) based WTS and ESS (WESS) cooperative control strategy for frequency regulation is proposed. Firstly, a frequency trajectory with a safety margin is actively planned according to the system frequency threshold, so that WESS takes the planned frequency trajectory as the control target. The WTS and the ESS are controlled with inertia and integrated control respectively to collaborate with fast power output. The proposed control strategy will ensure frequency safety while maintaining economy and achieving optimal utilization of ESS. The simulation model is established in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the effectiveness and economy of the control strategy."

        "abstract": "In the last few years more electric vehicles (EV) are being connected to the electricity network. Fast charging EVs is of paramount for the smooth transition of mobility from conventional oil/natural gas-based infrastructure towards electricity-based infrastructure. In the Netherlands, some pilots have started to understand the impacts of EV charging on the electricity networks. One such pilot case has taken place in a major city of the Netherlands, where every day many fast and slow charging of electric buses takes place in the same bus depot. As the EV chargers contain converters (power electronics-based components), these are considered as potential sources of harmonics (<2 kHz) and supraharmonics (2 kHz-150 kHz). Presently, there is no specific standard that gives limit values for supraharmonic emissions at a network connection point. It is anticipated that both harmonics and supraharmonic disturbances can have adverse impacts on the lifetime of connected devices. Theses emission can also disturb the quality of the supply voltage and may therefore affect the operation of other equipment in the same installation. The power quality measurement (PQM) results at this bus depot show harmonics and supraharmonic emissions from the EV charging points. In this paper various PQM results are summarized and their implications towards the present grid voltage quality are discussed."

To effectively minimize the energy bill in such a context, setting the target demand charge thresholds to be considered by the microgrid energy management system at the beginning of a new billing period is a challenging task. This paper proposes a heuristic to determine such thresholds using a linear programming model based on the site's energy consumption profile from the previous year. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the obtained values is assessed through a detailed full-year simulation study. Compared to demand charge thresholds obtained from a simpler heuristic, this assessment indicates an additional saving potential of 10% for the microgrid energy bill."

Application specific routing requires identification of traffic type, and subsequently a traffic model to best provision for this traffic. This paper presents an analysis of a link-based modeling approach to application performance prediction in the network to achieve fine-grained application specific Traffic Engineering (TE). Using a Software Defined Network (SDN) framework to collect network metrics and manage traffic flows, Machine Learning (ML) tools are applied to model application performance in the network. The performance model is used in network path selection on an application specific basis. Application performance is measured using application specific KPIs which are machine measurable and can be delivered as a metric to the network manager. Used together with network Quality of Service (QoS) metrics a network performance model for an application is determined. This paper identifies a link-based method for dynamic modeling and performs analysis comparing to End-to-End metric modeling. The paper investigates the trade-off between the two types of models to leverage the efficiency of applying the network metrics for modeling the application’s performance. Using VoIP as a use case, the PESQ quality indicator as a performance KPI and an SDN framework to collect and manage network metrics, a testbed is introduced for the purposes of developing and testing application performance modelling. Link and End-to-End metric performance modelling techniques are compared using this testbed."

This paper presents a quadratic optimization model for line parameter estimation, with smart meters and/or PMUs. Specifically, the line length of multi-phase distribution lines is estimated. A case study on the IEEE LVTestCase benchmark feeder shows that this works equally well with only smart meters instead of PMUs, and 3-4 samples from the smart meter time series suffice to retrieve the line lengths with high accuracy."

In this paper, the influence of PMSG on the sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) origins from DFIG with a VSC-HVDC is analysed based on the sequence impedance models. Similarly, the influence of DFIG on the medium-frequency oscillation (MFO) origins from PMSG with a VSC-HVDC is analysed as well. The analysis results show that both the two types of oscillations can be avoided according to the interaction between PMSG and DFIG with the appropriate parameters, which is meaningful for the actual project.

In this context, maintaining the quality-of-service and reliable operation can only be achieved with effective fault management. Precise fault management requires anomaly detection, identification and reaction. While hard failures, i.e. service disruptions, are detected easily, the task of detecting and identifying gradual degradations in the quality of transmission (QoT), so called soft-failures, is challenging. Machine learning (ML) provides powerful tools to accomplish this task. In this work, a novel three-stage soft-failure detection, identification and lifetime prediction framework of EDFAs based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed. The CNNs are trained on the spectral data extracted from the electrical power spectrum density (PSD) from a coherent receiver. The output of the framework is the remaining useful life (RUL) of the identified failing EDFA in the link. Extensive simulations are performed to validate the proposed framework. Excellent performance is achieved by the framework with the assumption that just one EDFA in the link is failing. The detection stage reaches an accuracy of 99.89% while the identification stage achieves 98.67% on an unseen data set. The RUL prediction stage achieves high regression (R2-) scores of 0.86 for sudden and 0.97 for gradual degradation of the EDFA pump laser."

The phishing attacks are growing rapidly in 2020, cyber attackers launched Covid-19 themed phishing attacks against healthcare facilities, the unemployed and workers. A lot of anti-phishing solutions are available heuristic detection, virtual similarity detection, black and whitelisting, and machine learning. This paper compares various research for each machine learning technique in terms of detecting phishing attacks and discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each methodology. In addition, this paper presents a detailed list of existing phishing attack threats as well as potential research directions in this sphere."

The proposed model is meant to exploit the flexibility of the controllable assets from the distribution network at the grid connection point (GCP), which is connected with a higher voltage network, in a preventive (N-1) secure and costoptimized way. The methodology is validated using a test bench network model with various technical constraints associated with the respective generation units. The results show the assessment of flexibility and capacity to control active and reactive power (PQ) in realtime operation."

To achieve high performances, current flow is usually controlled by means of hysteresis thresholds within a given band. Hysteresis regulation is very robust but, due to unavoidable hardware limitations, delays and inaccuracies are generated during current measurement; as a result, set thresholds can be systematically exceeded. In this work, an adaptive control is implemented in order to compensate as much as possible such defects in a solid state breaker/limiter for Medium Voltage Direct Current application. The concept has been successfully implemented by using Control Hardware in The Loop equipment and a real time simulator. Due to algorithm simplicity, implementation into device microcontroller is easy and it does not affect speed response. The final result is a better control of limited current, especially in the upper threshold. This goes to lower current peaks into the circuit and let to contain current ripple within imposed limits."

An efficient self-biased common gate-common source (CG-CS) coupling LNA with body coupling for improved noise figure (NF) was combined with three passive two-path mixers with capacitive load. This way, large decoupling capacitors can be avoided and antenna impedance matching without the need for external matching circuitry is achieved. Simulations show a high gain which can be varied between 52 dB and 16 dB, an NF of less than 9.4 dB and a current consumption of only 35 muA at 900mV supply voltage. In its lowest gain setting, an IIP3 of -22dBm is achieved. The structure is implemented in a 28nm CMOS technology. Currently, only post-layout simulation data is available and a test die for collecting experiment data is being manufactured."

        "abstract": "Fault diagnosis techniques can accurately determine the health condition of photovoltaic modules, as well as the specific fault type and level. Conventional machine learning diagnosis algorithms rely on expert knowledge and manual feature extraction to build feature engineering, which usually leads to limited performance. In addition, the existing fault diagnosis methods of photovoltaic modules have a limitation. They only take the influence of the area size of fault array into account when determining the fault level, and ignore the effect caused by the degree of fault factor itself. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method of photovoltaic modules based on deep residual network, which can automatically extract useful fault features. Raw current-voltage characteristic curves and ambient conditions are used as the input of the network. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, two datasets are obtained based on a laboratory experiment platform and the corresponding simulation model respectively. Furthermore, five popular machine learning methods, including support vector machine, decision tree, random forest and two other convolution neural networks, are used for comparison. According to the results, the proposed method achieves better comprehensive performance with the highest diagnostic accuracy and convergence speed."

An application designed for this purpose and its functional range are presented within an exemplary reactive power forecast for a real 110 kV grid. The development approach and the applied prediction method of a Generalized Additive Model show promising results especially for a not highly fluctuating reactive power behaviour of substations. In order to be able to forecast also highly fluctuating feeders correctly, a further optimization of the parameterization of the used models as well as the use of further and more accurate data is to be aspired."

This trend leads to a decrease in available kinetic energy that affects frequency stability since conventional power plants are being displaced. A common practice during frequency studies is to consider only the Center of Inertia (CoI). This approach implies the neglect of local frequency and RoCoF transients. Such an assumption might not always be valid. In this work, we elaborate on the mechanism behind the origin of local frequency transients. Then, we demonstrate with dynamic simulations that these transients can occur in the European context after a plausible single-contingency. The results lead to practical conclusions relevant to transmission system operators. For instance, we identify that zero inertia regions do not directly imply a worse local transient behavior."

Recent deep learning-based methods leverage a speaker discriminative model that maps a reference snippet uttered by the target speaker into a single embedding vector that encapsulates the characteristics of the target speaker. However, such modeling deliberately neglects the time-varying properties of the reference signal. In this work, we assume that a reference signal is available that is temporally correlated with the target signal. To take this correlation into account, we propose a time-varying source discriminative model that captures the temporal dynamics of the reference signal. We also show that existing methods and the proposed method can be generalized to non-speech sources as well. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the extraction performance when applied in an acoustic echo reduction scenario."

The paper explores the impact of the proposed controller in peak load shaving and load shifting with consequent improving of energy efficiency and cutting electricity bills. Besides, it investigates its readiness for demand response programs applications and connectivity with the innovative cloud computing platform. The investigation of a practical application example shows that the implementation of the power controller in a hotel complex yielded around 14% reduction in the maximum power absorption and around 2243€ associated annual saving that increase the overall energy performance. Increase in energy efficiency will result in optimal utilization of the available power generation, improving the stability of the grid, diminishing the use of low efficiency peak power plants and reducing the carbon footprint emissions. This work highlights the viability of the proposed controller and emphasizes its great benefits to electrical utilities and consumers."

In particular, the issue of the intermittence in power generation of renewable energy sources make it necessary their implementation in such plants. It is very important to take into account the aging phenomena of LIBs to optimize their usage and extend their lifetime. The aging is usually decomposed into calendar aging and cycle aging. In general, the factors that affect it are the temperature, the state of charge, the voltage limits, and the current rate. Several works analysed also the effect of the current ripple on the battery aging. Nevertheless, a rigorous analysis of the effect of the current frequency seems to be missing. Indeed, almost all the aging analyses relating current ripple do not take into account the higher temperatures due to the current ripple losses. Therefore, the effects of increased temperature and current ripple are never separated. Moreover, different frequency components in the same current ripple may lead to different aging. In this paper, a method to separate the temperature by the current frequency effect is proposed and the analysis of the aging LIBs due to the 100 Hz current harmonic is carried out."

Additionally certain feeders can be prioritised by the resupply strategy. Exemplary results of a simulated German medium voltage (MV) grid operating as a TIM with measurement data from the year 2017 show that the EM algorithm is suitable to achieve the required minimum operating time of 24 h in 70 % of the investigated scenarios.

On the health part, heart and brain signals play a fundamental role in providing data to smart platforms that may utilize this information in many ways to identify and treat some health conditions. This paper will cover emotional health, which grabs more attention because of social distancing that impacts the morality of the human being on a large scale. However, emotion recognition has a limitation based on the nature of emotion varieties due to the objects' personal, cultural, and psychological differences. Many researchers reported different cheap and practical methodologies of analysing Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect different insights of emotional states.

        "abstract": "The control and stability of power electronic converters are strongly related to the strength of the system to which they are connected. Traditionally, synchronous machines have provided a large share of the strength or “stiffness” of voltage control in the grid, but increasingly there are large power electronic converters in remote areas of the grid displacing this synchronous generation. At remote connection points, the network is susceptible to large changes in system strength if lines or generators trip. It is therefore challenging to design power electronic controls to remain stable over a wide range of system operating conditions. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate capabilities to use Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data to derive real-time indicators of the state of the network. These indicators of AC network state can be used to select an appropriate mode of operation by the High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) control. This paper describes the developed phasor-based control solution and details of its functional blocks. The control approach combines direct indication of the system strength with other indicators of the outcomes of a weakening system."

By applying a simulation tool for techno-economic analysis on synthetic test grid models, it has been shown that the conversion of AC low-voltage grid feeders to DC is a suitable solution to mitigate overloading and decrease voltage fluctuations caused by, inter alia, integration of electric vehicles (EVs), photovoltaic systems (PV) or increased energy demand. Cost models were applied to the simulation results. The economical findings indicate that the implementation of DC in low-voltage grids can be financially beneficial, especially when future developments and learning curves of DC technologies are considered."

It is currently discussed whether grid forming inverters would further increase the chance of islanding to occur in certain scenarios. Against this background, this paper serves to give insight into islanding prerequisites and will investigate a basic model of the different physical dependencies that will exist in islands that might be created around grid supporting as well as grid forming inverters in order to highlight fundamental differences between the two islanding situations. Based upon these, possible pathways to detect and cease islanding using grid forming inverters in compliance with current grid codes are illustrated. One of these possibilities is further investigated and demonstrated in a laboratory setup."

Those so-called Interconnectors depend on the processes and vice versa influence the processes in all subsystems they exist in to provide their services to the overall system. For the modeling of these interdependencies, stochastic activity networks are considered. An on-load tap changing transformer controlled by an intelligent electronic device is modelled to examine the feasibility of stochastic activity nets for Interconnector modelling. The controlled on-load tap changing transformer is mapped to a state-representing stochastic activity network as a detailed and a minimal model. This allows for an analysis of the necessary level of detail in the model. The results obtained via discrete-event simulation and evaluation of the developed stochastic activity networks show how stochastic activity networks allow for a state-based representation of Interconnectors in cyber-physical energy systems."

Distribution Network Operators across Great Britain are looking to mitigate the increased magnitude and variability of electricity demand induced by Low Carbon Technologies uptake by dynamically reconfiguring their Low Voltage (400V) networks. As part of the Active Response project, led by UK Power Networks, remote control switches are being deployed in underground distribution link boxes. This paper presents a novel tapered switch technology that will be evaluated during the project's field trials. The tapered contactor has the characteristics of very low on resistance to reduce heat dissipation, as well as a lifetime of more than 10,000 switching operations to facilitate network reconfiguration for intra-day variability of demand. Furthermore, novel applications of wireless charging and communications are presented which will maintain the environmental integrity of the link box while achieving reliable communications with the remote control system. This paper presents the methodology and preliminary laboratory results in advance of the design verification test programme required before Active Response project field trials."

In order to achieve accurate forecast of wind power for up to 50 seconds (very short-term forecasting), this paper proposes the method Fourier Denoising combined with Long Short-Term Memory (FD-LSTM). The FD-LSTM cascades the output of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based denoising algorithm to the input of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecaster. In this method, first, the inclusion of the FFT-based denoising algorithm ensures better and balanced performance for different forecasting horizons by removing the frequencies. Next, short-term forecasting by employing LSTM reduces the uncertainty and improves both the quality of the operation and the planning. In this paper, we first evaluate the performance of the proposed FD-LSTM method on increased forecasting horizons based on Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAPE), and R-Squared, and compare the results against linear regression. Afterwards, the method is tested with data sets where false data is present. The results show that FDLSTM outperforms the other forecasting methods under the presence of false data."

For ensuring high current ratings in the magnetic couplers used for this transfer, Litz wire conductors are used to deal with the skin effect due to the 85 kHz operating frequency imposed by SAE standards. These conductors are made by paralleling a more or less large number of strands of Litz wires. Depending on the Litz wire design, inhomogeneous current distributions between these strands can be observed. This article highlights this phenomenon by real measurements carried out on two 20 kW WPT prototypes and study the relevant parameters to propose solutions. Tests on different designs, different connectors at the ends, as well as an easy way to perform Litz wire test method are provided. Finally, the proposals developed and validated experimentally made it possible to obtain a new prototype with a 20% reduction in winding losses while dividing the necessary quantity of copper volume by 2.5."

All samples were able to ignite, followed by self-propagating exothermic reaction along the LTCC substrate surfaces which were simultaneously monitored using high velocity pyrometer and camera measurements. The adhesion of the ignited RMS was improved on LTCC substrates having surface roughness more than about 600 nm. A reduced influence of the substrate roughness on the measured temperatures was detected for these samples as well as measurements of their reaction velocities clarify a higher impact of different surface roughness. The promising results suggest that the reaction properties and the wave propagating directions can be controlled during reactive bonding or soldering of several applications in the field of electronic packaging by manipulating the substrate morphologies, e.g. using laser ablation on bonding areas."

Consequently, comparing consecutive measurements in different bands is not straightforward.

The design is based on a rotating arm, spinning a lightweight transmitter chip with an antenna around a central pivot.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an optimization scheme of distribution network topology based on common information model (CIM). Firstly, the original CIM data is simplified and reconstructed, and the topology related information is extracted, which greatly reduces the data storage scale, simplifies the operation mode, and provides conditions for the subsequent large-scale application. Secondly, five definitions of typical distribution network topology problems are proposed, and the specific network optimization scheme is proposed to reduce the number of households in power outage. Finally, the actual grid data of a city in southern China is taken as an example to verify the scheme, and the final optimization result is also recognized by the front-line engineers, which shows that the grid optimization scheme proposed in this paper can effectively identify the grid problems existing in the distribution network reliability."

Based on the method, the impact of other control loops on the damping, such as current control loop (CC) and grid dynamics, can be quantitatively studied with the corrected damping torque superimposing to the PLL. The overall impact of each control loop on the damping can also be evaluated through this method. The method is validated through both eigenvalue analyses and time domain simulations."

In general, gait of a person is unique and contains useful information belong to that person. Therefore, gait analysis has been used in areas of healthcare, security, sport and fitness. This work differs from other studies by using signals recorded from wearable sensors worn by subjects walking on nine different surfaces. These data and convolutional neural network were employed for walking surface detection. This demonstrates that gait of a person is adopted to walking surface and changes in the gait on different surfaces can be used for walking surface detection. In the experiment, 7958 3-second-long segments were classified with an accuracy of 95%."

        "abstract": "Quantum Annealer (QA) is well-suited for a certain class of optimization problems which can be expressed as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. A QUBO problem belongs to the family of Integer Programming problems which are called the NP-hard optimization problems. Feasible solutions of such problems can be found by using classical optimization techniques. However, studies claim that QA can find a feasible global solution that is faster than a classical annealer for QUBO problems. Hence, it appears promising to program and use the QA-to-QUBO approach for Earth Observation. In search of the QUBO problem in the domain of Earth Observation, we examined several Inteferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) applications and identified a residue connection problem in the phase unwrapping procedure. In particular, we consider the residue connection problem with multiples of 2pi as a QUBO problem. For this practical problem, we studied how to formulate this QUBO problem, and we examined the challenges to program the D-Wave quantum annealer, in particular, embedding the QUBO problem into our QA architecture with a so-called Pegasus topology, and the annealing parameter settings in the D-Wave quantum annealer. We then analysed the parameter effects on finding the global minimum of the residue connection problem. From these results, we derived and enhanced our insight for programming future quantum annealers; for instance, choosing real-world problems in Earth Observation, conceiving the embedding procedure, and the tuning of the annealing parameters."

        "abstract": "In this work it is argued that the Fourth Industrial Revolution (I4.0) will be the result of a technology fusion between the following factors that define an economic epoch: a) The production systems and the type of tools these systems are employing; b) The communication technologies as well as the means used for information storage, processing, sensing and knowledge creation: the information and communication technologies (ICT); c) The energy generation and distribution systems used and d) The biotechnology. The thesis of this work is that ICT is the predominant factor in the context of I4.0. To justify this claim, the progress of the scientific fields from which this factor consists is elaborated and its impact on other factors is highlighted with emphasis on the societal impact. It is claimed that the eventual fusion of these factors will lead to a single technological continuum. The eventual fusion of all factors is made possible because they all exploit a common technological (hardware) framework while we are entering the era where we can regulate and superintend a vast amount of heterogeneous technologies via open software. In the context of I4.0, this results in a tremendous boost in productivity as it will allow a user to switch between different activities dynamically. Moreover, through this process a whole rank of middlemen is made redundant, cutting down costs and inefficiencies. Finally, one-click customisation will rationalise production, creating the conditions where overproduction will gradually die out, promoting the resilience of the economy. Therefore, ICT-enabled I4.0 will redefine the notions of ‘production’ and ‘work’, as it will allow us to overcome over-fragmentation in specialisation, while reshaping our cities, our personal lives and our relationship with science."

This model generates a decent description utilizing the trained data. To extract features from images we need encoder, we use CNN as encoder. To decode the description of image generated we use LSTM.

This research work aims to control single-phase battery energy storage (BESS) units to mitigate unbalance conditions. Single-phase load demands are modelled using real data and voltage unbalance is quantified by using the ‘voltage unbalance factor’ as defined in IEC 61000-2-2. The BESS units are modelled in detail including the main electrical components and the control system. The BESS inverters are controlled to supply active and reactive power demand of the load, thus limiting the unbalance levels in the network. The operating point of each BESS is also monitored to avoid overloading of the units. Voltage unbalance factor is monitored at various locations, without and with the BESSs, and the impact of the proposed control system is assessed considering realistic operating conditions based on measurements of load demand with a 1-minute resolution."

The data sharing of multiple PV power stations in the same area can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of power generation. However, data integration often brings about problems of information security and data privacy. In order to solve the problem that data sharing and privacy protection can not be balanced, a PV power prediction model based on federated learning is proposed in this paper. On the premise of ensuring the information security of each local power data, the collection of decentralized data and joint multi-party data are constructed. At the same time, under the condition that the data of each power station are confidential to each other, the federated server collects the encrypted training parameters of each power station after local training for integration training, and makes PV power generation prediction without sacrificing security and privacy of the power station. The result shows the prospect of federated learning for forecasting the power of photovoltaic power stations without compromising privacy."

In this paper, a multidimensional indicator-based lithium-ion battery fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed to obtain the weights of different dimensional indicators in the battery fault evaluation system, which applies entropy weight method to calculate the risk coefficients of each individual battery for battery fault diagnosis. The algorithm validation work in this paper is completed in the MIT-Stanford public experimental data set and the actual operation data set of the energy storage system. Firstly, the data feature extraction method suitable for engineering application scenarios is selected. Then, the entropy weight method is used to calculate the weights of each indicator, and then the cause of the battery failure is analysed based on the weight information of each indicator. The method with the entropy of each dimensional indicator to calculate its weight can locate the faulty battery and reduce the subjectivity in the fault analysis process. Meanwhile, the method is suitable for real-time fault diagnosis of lithiumion battery systems without complicated training models and hyper-parameter adjustment processes."

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the impact of ac system strength on the stability of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM) type grid-forming converter. A grid-forming VSM without additional control loops, such as overcurrent limiting, is first considered and used as a reference for comparison with a more realistic VSM with current limiting control loops. A small-signal model of the system is developed for both cases. The models are validated by comparing their transient responses with a detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation. Subsequent analysis using the developed small-signal model shows that a VSM type grid-forming converter with current limiting capability exhibits poorer damping when the connected ac network has a high short-circuit ratio (SCR). This poor damping arises from the addition of the current control loop. The paper will show that when the current controller is absent, the SCR of the ac network has minimal impact on the stability behavior of the VSM."

Studies like the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adult Development and Aging (ILSE) are of particular interest to quantify the predictive power of biomarkers in terms of acoustic/linguistic features. ILSE consists of ca. 6500 hours of interviews and only 10% were manually transcribed. To extract linguistic features, we need to build reliable ASR to provide transcriptions. The ILSE-corpus is challenging for ASR, due to a combination of factors. In this study, we present our effort to overcome some of these challenges. We automatically segmented 45-minutes of interviews into shorter segments and time aligned. Using these segments, we developed HMMDNN based ASR and achieved 33.55% of WER. Based on this system, we recreated the time-alignments for manualtranscriptions and derived acoustic and linguistic features for classifier-training. we applied the resulting system for dementia screening and achieved UAR of 0.867 for a threeclass problem."

However, at present, China's scrap steel sorting and recycling work is mainly completed manually, with subjectivity and uncertainty. Most of the existing domestic technologies do not take into account the complex actual situation of waste steel mixing such as multiple types and shapes in the actual sorting project. Therefore, a scrap recognition and evaluation technology based on target detection is proposed in this paper. After using vgg16 as the main network for feature extraction, input the feature map into the region proposal network to generate the candidate box, and then use the maximum pooling method to obtain the fixed dimension features, which are sent to the full connection network to predict the classification of each ROI. The experiment on the scrap dataset shows that the accuracy of the scrap evaluation technology based on Faster-RCNN can reach 87.3%, which can provide a better solution for the automatic identification and evaluation of scrap."

Systems will need to adapt new methods of monitoring security of supply, while encouraging investments in key system services, like stability, flexibility and adequacy. This can be done by creating well-designed markets that minimize economic costs through unlocking latent sources of flexibility. In addition, systems should pursue interconnections with neighbouring systems to take advantage of complementarity and enhance coordination between the gas and electricity sectors in order to increase security and lower overall system costs."

LoRaWAN nodes use the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm to adapt their data rates during operation. The standard ADR algorithm works well with stationary nodes, however is very slow in the adaptation for mobile nodes. This paper introduces a new ADR algorithm for LoRaWAN that is supported by higher level meta-data for sensor streams, namely Quality of Information (QoI). With the help of QoI it is possible to provide additional information to the new ADR algorithm, reducing the convergence time and thus improving the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) of data from mobile sensor nodes. The new algorithm requires only modifications on network server side and keeps backwards compatibility with LoRaWAN nodes. Results show a significant better PDR compared to the standard ADR in scenarios with a limited number of mobile nodes."

        "abstract": "Today, many organisations are moving their subscriptions to the cloud because the number of clients is increasing day by day. To provide better services to users with less cost, cloud computing is a fair solution. However, use of cloud services has resulted in different issues such as: hosting service, hardware failure and memory allocation of data, in other words - data loss. There is the risk of security breaches by malicious users. Different sets of new security risks and difficulties have occurred in cloud architectures. Most intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are designed to deal with multiple types of attacks and there is no single system that can guarantee security from future attacks. Therefore, there is a need for an integrated system that can provide strong insurance against various risks. In this paper, a detailed review of the role of the firewall, intrusion detection and prevention (IDPS), honeypot, and integration of IDPS with honeypot in the security domain of the cloud is illustrated. One way is that an IDPS will look for data packets, if the data is found to be malicious, the system will be transferred to the honeypot via firewall. In the case of integration of IDPS, honeypot is being used to divert the malicious traffic away from the system. Honeypot is a non-violent infrastructure with limited network information. The attacker will understand it as a real environment and go here and there to get basic information. At this point, we can easily find the attacker. Our analysis goal is to provide an easy and concise view of the different security models for cloud architecture."

A field test in a predecessor project demonstrated that grid congestion can be avoided by this quota-based approach. This paper describes the advantages and disadvantages of the formerly used calculation method, introduces a refined quota calculation method and both methods are compared. The refined method will be implemented and validated in another comprehensive field test in the project ‘flexQgrid’."

The paper presents results of the real environment flexibility demonstrations in a smart office environment. The results of the flexibility tests of EV charging stations indicate that there might be challenges to meet the technical requirements of the FCR-D market. The business potential of the EV charging stations aggregation to the reserve markets is low in the studied case. However, it is expected that in the future, there will be a significant flexibility potential in the EV charging network. The BESS provided peak power shaving, reactive power compensation, and FCR-N control reliably during the demonstration period. Peak power shaving and reactive power compensation support the operation of the local distribution grid, and the service provision of FCR-N supports the operation of the power system. An operation strategy of the BESS that combines peak power shaving, reactive power compensation and FCR-N operation was presented. However, the optimal operation strategy of the demonstrated BESS depends on many factors, especially on power demand of the building, power tariffs and the prices of the FCR-N market."

We investigate jointly active beamforming at the AP and passive phase shifting at the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for successfully delivering the control signals from the AP to the actuators within a required time duration. The transmission follows a two-stage design. In the first stage, each actuator can both receive the direct signal from AP and the reflected signal from the RIS. In the second stage, the actuators with successful reception in the first stage, relay the message through the D2D network to the actuators with failed receptions. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem where we first obtain an equivalent but more tractable form by addressing the problem with discrete indicator functions. Then, Frobenius inner product based equality is applied for decoupling the optimization variables. Further, we adopt a penalty-based approach to resolve the rank-one constraints. Finally, we deal with the l0-norm by l1- norm approximation and add an extra term l1 − l2 for sparsity. Numerical results reveal that the proposed two-stage RIS-aided D2D communication protocol is effective for enabling reliable communication with latency requirements."

Following, we estimate the typical statistical characterization of a user of Great Buenos Aires (GBA). Finally, we make an application of the statistical characterization of the users for electrical calculations of LV networks. Our results show a statistical distribution with an average power and a standard deviation nearby standard deviation of real surveyed users today. The statistical user demand characterization allows us to establish LV distribution network power scenarios and carry out electric current calculus, network node voltages, electric losses, and to obtain results with a statistical distribution. Considering the future incorporation of Renewable Distributed Generation (DG), it is possible that voltage nodes and voltage control criteria would be affected.

In this paper we present a control scheme based on the virtual synchronous machine with two different methods of overcurrent protection.

This paper develops a frequency dependent model (FDM) of the DC cable for the Sun Cable Australia-ASEAN Power Link (AAPowerLink). The effect of field joints and the associated earthing resistance is addressed. Exclusion of field joints introduces discrepancy in the core voltage along the cable length and the frequency dependent impedance. Simplification of the cable model within an electromagnetic transient (EMT) platform, whilst retaining a representative frequency dependent behaviour, is demonstrated. Modelling in PSCAD/EMTDC suggests minimum impact of submersion depth on the cable characteristics. Furthermore, the potential for harvesting energy at the field joints is explored."

        "abstract": "Modern power system is undergoing a paradigm shift from the synchronous generators-based system to the power electronics converters-dominated system. With the high penetration of converters, serious stability problems are provoked, especially the wideband oscillations (e.g., sub-synchronous oscillations, harmonic oscillations, etc). Various studies have been conducted in this respect, while most of them separate the ac-side stability with the dc-side stability. However, for the stability analysis of the hybrid AC/DC grid, it is necessary to consider the converter's ac-side and dc-side, simultaneously. In this paper, the stability analysis of voltage source converters (VSCs) considering both ac and dc dynamics is carried out. At first, the threeport AC/DC admittance model of VSCs is established, and the corresponding measurement method from simulations is presented to validate its accuracy. Secondly, based on such three-port model, two stability analysis methods are presented: the one is based on the system open-loop model, where the stability can be judged via the Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC); the other one is based on the system closed-loop model, whose stability can be predicted through the pole-zero calculation. At last, a test AC/DC system is built in MATLAB/Simulink, by which the effectiveness of the three-port model-based stability analysis is validated."

The project is called Aachen Lüttich Electricity Grid Overlay or “ALEGrO”. This new interconnector is the first and only electrical connection between BE and DE. The transport capacity of ALEGrO is 1.000 Megawatt (MW). Due to the project’s outstanding role with regard to European electricity system and market integration, ALEGrO has been funded by the European Commission’s TEN-E-Programm and has been included in the list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI) of the European Union. From a technical point of view this new HVDC link is a pioneering project: It is the first HVDC based tieline implanted into a highly meshed, synchronously operated AC transmission grid in the the middle of continental Europe. This comes along with diverse particularities and challenges in Market Integration and System Operation, which are described in this paper."

        "abstract": "Currently, the majority of the available test feeder models are based on the North American type of distribution systems, leaving an absence of representative feeder models for the European (and Dutch) types of distribution systems. Therefore, a standardized set of power flow models for typical Dutch LV distribution networks is developed using real networks and operational data provided by a Dutch DSO. These network models are used to assess if typical Dutch LV distribution networks are ready to operate with large penetration of low-carbon energy technologies (e.g. PV systems, electric heat pumps, EVs). According to the obtained results, simulations of all the modelled networks showed the same behaviour for the power flow at the head of the distribution system and the voltage magnitude level. The changes in voltage magnitude however is dependent on the size of the network, resulting in larger changes in the larger networks. While the voltage magnitude level of the smaller networks stays within the ± 10% range, the larger networks encounter voltage magnitude violations. Thus, it can be concluded that the larger networks are not ready (under the current conditions) for large penetrations of low-carbon energy technologies, while the smaller networks appear to be ready."

Typically, a deep neural network is applied to isolate the relevant target speaker characteristics. In this paper, we focus on a single-channel target speaker extraction system based on a CNN-LSTM separator network and a speaker embedder network requiring reference speech of the target speaker. In the LSTM layer of the separator network, we propose to customize the LSTM cells in order to only remember the specific voice patterns corresponding to the target speaker by modifying the information processing in the forget gate. Experimental results for two-speaker mixtures using the Librispeech dataset show that this customization significantly improves the target speaker extraction performance compared to using standard LSTM cells."

In the present paper, a methodology is investigated to predict the electrical and thermal behaviors of a battery cell. This work describes a model identification procedure for identifying an electro-thermal model of lithium-ion batteries used in automotive applications. The dynamic model structure adopted is based on equivalent circuit model whose parameters are scheduled on the state-of-charge, temperature, and current. The model identified in this way is valid inside a large range of temperatures and state-of-charge, so that the resulting model can be used for automotive applications such as on-board estimation of the state-of-charge and state-of-health. The model coefficients are identified using a multiple step algorithm-based optimization procedure. The validity of the procedure is demonstrated experimentally for A123 commercial LFP/graphite battery cells."

        "abstract": "Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has become the key investigation for early diagnosis of small bowel disorders, displacing all other imaging modalities. However, despite considerable technical progress, the most advanced pills still lack intrinsic controllable locomotion and require large external equipment for magnetic propulsion. Most of the WCE devices simply rely on gravity assisted by peristaltic contraction for transit, thereby incurring the risks of impaction, retention and intestinal obstruction requiring active clinical intervention. The major obstacles to provision of intrinsic of WCE pills stem from size, rigidity, and limited on-board power supply. In this study, we propose the use of vibrations by unidirectional actuator (VIBU) to achieve controlled skid on the slippery small bowel mucosal lining. The VIBU rubber legs are designed and optimized to follow the path in tube or cylindrical internal environment of the small bowel (SB) that provides controlled intrinsic active locomotion. Eventually this concept will replace the rigid WCE pill by a segmented soft highly flexible robot, significantly narrower but longer than current WCE pills. In developing the soft robotic device, two different vibratory mechanisms have been explored. In this paper the micro eccentric rotating mass vibration motor (ERM) is used to demonstrate VIBU functionality by transiting throughout PVC tube and airfilled nylon shelve. The result confirmed that the combination of vibratory mechanism and fixed rubber legs, provide the VIBU with unidirectional propulsion in cylindrical environment."

However, the power electronic converter-based devices can interact with other grid components and lead to unstable oscillation in a wide frequency range, for instance, the subsynchronous and high-frequency oscillations. In the past decade, several subsynchronous control interaction (SSCI) events have been reported, for instance, in the Xcel Energy, ERCOT, Guyuan, and Hami wind power systems. This chapter first provides a brief overview of the occurrence mechanisms and features of various real-world SSCI events. Then, it discusses the practical impedance reshaping mitigation control schemes. The practical installation experience of both generator-side and grid-side impedance reshaping control techniques is provided, which enhances the confidence to practically implement these schemes in the actual power systems that are facing similar challenges. Finally, recommended guidelines and research prospects in the analysis and mitigation are provided."

One key milestone in this process is the completion of the layout. This, however, is very challenging as many iterations are usually necessary due to parasitic effects. In order to address this challenge in analog layout design, our work extends procedural generator-based automation. A declarative array template is embedded into the common generator structure. Following this structure, generator code is automatically generated with a schematic as the input. Using this approach, a flexible generator is created immediately that allows automatic design of array-style layouts with template-based flexibility and at generator-based execution speed. In addition, the template enables early and fast parasitic estimates. Our combined approach contributes to analog layout automation by bridging the gap between generators and templates."

        "abstract": "Demand response (DR) refers to utility programs that encourage customers to shift their electric usage during times of high demand on the electric grid. It is a widely used technique to minimize the peak to average consumption ratio. Thus, targeting the right customers becomes important because each program enrollment has costs including marketing enrollment and the setup of enabling hardware at the customer sites. In Thailand, DR events have started since 2014 but the evidences suggest that DR events have not been as successful as they were expected. Most enrolled customers cannot achieve the given curtailment target. However, with the rapid integration of Automatic Meter Reading (AMR), utilities can have a better understanding of electrical consumption behaviour and significantly change how DR targeting is done. In this paper, the situation and details of Thailand's DR are presented. Also, the paper performed customer daily load profiling analysis by using K-Means clustering algorithm in order to select potential groups of customers who can collectively achieve 100 MW load curtailment target. Actual customers load profile data includes 15-minute kilowatt values for 6,050 commercial and industrial customers from 2018 to 2020. Results show that three groups of customers are recommended for DR event participation."

        "abstract": "In recent grid codes (e.g., German grid codes) for inverter-based generation (IBG), dual-sequence reactive current injection during asymmetrical grid faults has been stipulated. Due to the interconnection of the positive- and negative-sequence networks during asymmetrical faults, a positive-sequence reactive current injection (over-excited) can lift both positive- and negative-sequence voltages, while a negative-sequence reactive current injection (under-excited) can reduce both. Therefore, a compromise should be reached to meet the grid code requirements. While injecting current during grid faults, it has been reported that IBG is likely to lose synchronism with the grid due to the grid impedance interaction, in particular in a weak grid scenario. This is commonly referred to as synchronization instability. In this paper, a quantitative analysis is carried out to identify the maximum current injection for IBG under different types of asymmetrical faults, giving the dual-sequence current injection limit considering the interconnection of the sequence networks. Based on quantitative results, whether the current grid codes can be generally followed in a weak grid scenario is evaluated. Additionally, recommendations are provided on the reasonable regulation of the proportional coefficients between the amplitude of the current output and the voltage. The analysis results are verified by simulations."
