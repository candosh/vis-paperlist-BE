Visual Search Target Inference in Natural Interaction Settings with Machine Learning
Michael Barz,Sven Stauden,Daniel Sonntag
Article No.: 1, pp 1–8https://doi.org/10.1145/3379155.3391314
Visual search is a perceptual task in which humans aim at identifying a search target object such as a traffic sign among other objects. Search target inference subsumes computational methods for predicting this target by tracking and analyzing overt ...

Combining Gaze Estimation and Optical Flow for Pursuits Interaction
Mihai Bace,Vincent Becker,Chenyang Wang,Andreas Bulling
Article No.: 2, pp 1–10https://doi.org/10.1145/3379155.3391315
Pursuit eye movements have become widely popular because they enable spontaneous eye-based interaction. However, existing methods to detect smooth pursuits require special-purpose eye trackers. We propose the first method to detect pursuits using a ...

Article No.: 3, pp 1–9https://doi.org/10.1145/3379155.3391316
Gaze behavior is important in early development, and atypical gaze behavior is among the first symptoms of autism. Here we describe a system that quantitatively assesses gaze behavior using eye-tracking glasses. Objects in the subject’s field of view ...

A MinHash approach for fast scanpath classification
David Geisler,Nora Castner,Gjergji Kasneci,Enkelejda Kasneci
Article No.: 4, pp 1–9https://doi.org/10.1145/3379155.3391325
The visual scanpath describes the shift of visual attention over time. Characteristic patterns in the attention shifts allow inferences about cognitive processes, performed tasks, intention, or expertise. To analyse such patterns, the scanpath is often ...

Label Likelihood Maximisation: Adapting iris segmentation models using domain adaptation
Anton Mølbjerg Eskildsen,Dan Witzner Hansen
Article No.: 5, pp 1–9https://doi.org/10.1145/3379155.3391327
We propose to use unlabelled eye image data for domain adaptation of an iris segmentation network. Adaptation allows the model to be less reliant on its initial generality. This is beneficial due to the large variance exhibited by eye image data which ...

We benchmark a new hybrid eye-tracker system against the DPI (Dual Purkinje Imaging) tracker and the Tobii Spectrum in a series of three experiments. In a first within-subjects battery of tests, we show that the precision of the new eye-tracker is much ...

We present the first method to anticipate averted gaze in natural dyadic interactions. The task of anticipating averted gaze, i.e. that a person will not make eye contact in the near future, remains unsolved despite its importance for human social ...

Article No.: 8, pp 1–9https://doi.org/10.1145/3379155.3391312
Eye gaze is a fast and ergonomic modality for pointing but limited in precision and accuracy. In this work, we introduce BimodalGaze, a novel technique for seamless head-based refinement of a gaze cursor. The technique leverages eye-head coordination ...

Article No.: 9, pp 1–12https://doi.org/10.1145/3379155.3391313
Display-based interfaces pose high demands on users’ eyes that can cause severe vision and eye problems, also known as digital eye strain (DES). Although these problems can become even more severe if the eyes are actively used for interaction, prior ...
