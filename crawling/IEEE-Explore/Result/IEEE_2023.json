        "abstract": "Although many long-range imaging systems are designed to support extended vision applications, a natural obstacle to their operation is degradation due to atmospheric turbulence. Atmospheric turbulence causes significant degradation to image quality by introducing blur and geometric distortion. In recent years, various deep learning-based single image atmospheric turbulence mitigation methods, including CNN-based and GAN inversion-based, have been proposed in the literature which attempt to remove the distortion in the image. However, some of these methods are difficult to train and often fail to reconstruct facial features and produce unrealistic results, especially in the case of high turbulence. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently gained some traction because of their stable training process and their ability to generate high quality images. In this paper, we propose the first DDPM-based solution for the problem of atmospheric turbulence mitigation. We also propose a fast sampling technique for reducing the inference times for conditional DDPMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world data to show the significance of our model. To facilitate further research, all codes and pretrained models are publically available at http://github.com/Nithin-GK/AT-DDPM",

There are three key aspects to the cFS architecture: a dynamic run-time environment, layered software, and a component-based design. It is the combination of these key aspects that makes it suitable for reuse on any number of flight projects and/or embedded software systems at a significant cost and schedule savings. This tutorial will give a brief overview of the architecture and demonstrate a simple app development and deployment.",

        "abstract": "The definition of the State of Charge (SoC) at pack level represents a crucial task to be addressed in order to maximize the performances of lithium-ion battery packs while ensuring its safe operating conditions. Indeed, Soc estimation methods are currently safety oriented, thus focused on identifying the Soc of the least/most charged cells. However, this approach does not take into account for the actual pack energy utilization. This paper proposes a methodology based on an Adaptive Square-Root Unscented Kalman Filter for correctly estimating both the Soc at pack level and the one related to the least/most charged cell with a low computational cost.",

The talk provides a brief introduction to the lithium-sulfur chemistry, focusing on the modeling, estimation, and control challenges associated with this chemistry. The talk then surveys some of the key challenges and opportunities associated with the application of machine learning methods, especially the deep learning of battery dynamics, to this chemistry. Areas of overlap and potential synergy between machine learning and physics-based modeling approaches are particularly emphasized in this discussion.",

Supporting hybrid participation adds expense as it also enables participation for a wide range of investigators who might not otherwise attend. It is only a partial substitute for the many benefits of being able to interact and network with members of our field, but it is better than nothing. In this time of climate crisis, the burden our conference places on the environment is a further, critical component. Please help us with your feedback on this topic!",

In addition, DC cables are designed and manufactured by reflecting the characteristics of the DC system. In order to verify the performance of the manufactured prototype, a test procedure for a certified performance test is established, and a certified test is conducted based on it. It even includes verifying the reliability of long-term operations by piloting research results to an empirical site. Based on this paper, it is judged that it can contribute to standardization of lowvoltage DC power cables that is currently insufficient.",

In this talk, we will explore the space of this connection pitch scaling and the functional enhancements that this kind of scaling can achieve. Specifically, we will describe lithographic (versus mechanical) alignment schemes for inter-strata interconnects. Finally we will explore the application of these methods to heterogeneous wafer engineering.",

        "abstract": "Modern SAT solvers are based on a paradigm named conflict driven clause learning (CDCL), and CDCL(T) remains the main method for SMT. Local search is an important alternative for satisfiable instances, which has witnessed significant progress in SAT, and has begun to show promising results in SMT. Furthermore, recent techniques integrating local search into CDCL have brought significant improvements, and local search is widely used in state of the art CDCL solvers as an important component. Similar results have also been observed in CDCL(T). This talk will introduce state of the art local search methods for SAT and SMT, and also present the recent techniques of combining local search and CDCL/CDCL(T).",

A transformer encoder handles occlusions and redundant detections, and a convolutional autoencoder is in charge of background reconstruction. We show that this architecture significantly outperforms the state of the art on complex synthetic benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "This paper attempted to establish a serious accident prevention measure considering the specificity of the working environment and a close analysis of safety accidents that occurred at power distribution construction sites in the past. KEPCO conducts about 280,000 construction projects a year, and on average, about 5,000 workers are working at about 1,500 locations nationwide every day. The main problem is that one mistake has more fatal consequences than other industrial sites because it deals with power distribution facilities with electricity flowing. As a result of analyzing past serious accidents and near miss, KEPCO found that serious accidents were repeatedly occurring in three areas: falling, electric shock, and jamming. The working environment was improved by introducing safety measures to physically separate harmful and risk factors in three fields. In addition, Reliability was verified by performing additional improvements based on the collection of opinions from workers and work managers at the construction site.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on improving the calibration performance of the post-hoc approach for the distributional shift. Taking the popular temperature scaling (TS) as a case in point, the key task is finding a matched temperature for the shifted test set. To address this issue, we pose an insight that temperature is strongly correlated with the shifting intensity by a tiny experiment. Based on the finding, we propose a simple yet effective approach named Surrogate Based Temperature Scaling (SBTS), where the surrogate model is trained to map the relationship between temperature and the shifting intensity. Empirical experimental results of various shift types on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that SBTS can significantly improve the calibration performance under distributional shift.",

        "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL) system has recently become prominent as a concept to process data distributed across many individual sources without the need to centralize it. Multiple participants collaboratively train models based on their local data in a privacy-aware manner. To date, VFL has become a de facto solution to securely learn a model among organizations, allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising privacy of any individuals. Despite the prosperous development of VFL systems, we find that certain inputs of a participant, named adversarial dominating inputs (ADIs), can dominate the joint inference towards the direction of the adversary's will and force other (victim) participants to make negligible contributions, losing rewards that are usually offered regarding the importance of their contributions in federated learning scenarios. We conduct a systematic study on ADIs by first proving their existence in typical VFL systems. We then propose gradient-based methods to synthesize ADIs of various formats and exploit common VFL systems. We further launch greybox fuzz testing, guided by the saliency score of \"victim\" participants, to perturb adversary-controlled inputs and systematically explore the VFL attack surface in a privacy-preserving manner. We conduct an in-depth study on the influence of critical parameters and settings in synthesizing ADIs. Our study reveals new VFL attack opportunities, promoting the identification of unknown threats before breaches and building more secure VFL systems.",

        "abstract": "Point clouds are playing an increasingly important roll in autonomous driving and robotics. Although current point cloud classification models have achieved satisfactory accuracies, most of them trade slight performance gains by stacking complex modules on the grouping-local-global framework, which leads to prolonged processing time and deteriorating interpretability. In this work, we propose a new pipeline named Fractual Projection Forest (FPF) that exploits fractal features to enable traditional machine learning models to achieve competitive performance with DNNs on classification tasks. Though compromises by few percentages in accuracy compared to DNNs, FPF is faster, more interpretable, and easily extendable. We hope that FPF may provide the community with a novel view of point cloud classification. Our code is available on https://github.com/Explain3D/FracProjForest.",

CMOS SPAD arrays in image sensor format, with integrated photon timing and processing, have enabled all-digital receiver units to be realised that, combined with pulsed, multi-element laser sources, are now supporting demanding applications such as automotive LIDAR. We review important advances at device-, circuit- and system-level that have helped propel SPADs to the forefront of LIDAR innovation and consider potential future directions in SPAD architectures for LIDAR.",

        "abstract": "Burst super-resolution technique provides a possibility of restoring rich details from low-quality images. However, since real world low-resolution (LR) images in practical applications have multiple complicated and unknown degradations, existing non-blind (e.g., bicubic) designed networks usually suffer severe performance drop in recovering high-resolution (HR) images. In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing HR images from raw burst sequences acquired from modern handheld devices. The central idea is a kernel-guided strategy which can solve the burst SR problem with two steps: kernel estimation and HR image restoration. The former estimates burst kernels from raw inputs, while the latter predicts the super-resolved image based on the estimated kernels. Furthermore, we introduce a pyramid kernel-aware deformable alignment module which can effectively align the raw images with consideration of the blurry priors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can perform favorable state-of-the-art performance in the burst SR problem.",

I will show recent experimental data on a “quantum supremacy” experiment with 53 qubits: the Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to run a quantum circuit a million times - the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. Finally, I will explain some of the future uses of quantum algorithms and what may be in store for the field in the next 10 years.",

This is achieved by harnessing the physical symmetries of the molecular system under consideration. They can also enable qubit-based complete active space approximation. The present work explores aspects of the symmetry-adapted encoding in the form of an opensource Python software, QuantumSymmetry, by considering a simple example of molecular system, that of the water molecule.",

The precise estimation provides correct BP control signal adjustment. In this case, the control signal is SMPS output voltage. The correct adjustment increases the BP lifetime. In this paper, we propose a method, based on extended Kalman filter (EKF), that is controlling lithium iron phosphate BP charge and discharge. This paper includes the required mathematical background, BP modeling, BP parameters identification algorithm and the final solution with appropriate results.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has been applied to provide health care facilities for elders and parents. Remote health care is essential for providing scarce resources and facilities to coronavirus patients. Ongoing IoMT communication is susceptible to potential security attacks. In this research, an artificial intelligence-driven security model of the IoMT is also proposed to simulate and analyses the results. Under the proposed plan, only authorized users will be able to access private and sensitive patient information, and unauthorized users will be unable to access a secure healthcare network. The various phases for implementing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the IoMT system have been discussed. AI-driven IoMT is implemented using decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and k-nearest neighbours (KNN) techniques. The KNN learning models are recommended for IoMT applications due to their low consumption time with high accuracy and effective prediction.",

        "abstract": "Numerous instances of dragon fruit diseases over the years have caused an estimated 14% annual crop loss globally, affecting untold millions of people. The study of dragon fruit illnesses, or pathology, aims to increase plants’ chances of surviving in the presence of pathogenic parasite microbes and poor climatic conditions. Environment-related elements that influence the development of dragon fruit diseases include temperature, pH, humidity, and moisture. Misdiagnosis can result in chemical overuse that costs money, environmental imbalance and pollution, and the establishment of pathogen strains that are resistant to treatment. The process of diagnosing diseases nowadays is time-consuming, expensive, and dependent on human scouting. Compared to the current method, automatic disease segmentation and diagnosis from dragon fruit photos can be somewhat useful. This study uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, to accurately identify four kinds of apple plant diseases from photographs of apple plant leaves. “Healthy,” “scab,” “rust,” and “many illnesses” are among the classifications.",

        "abstract": "Remarkable effectiveness of the channel or spatial attention mechanisms for producing more discernible feature representation are illustrated in various computer vision tasks. However, modeling the cross-channel relationships with channel dimensionality reduction may bring side effect in extracting deep visual representations. In this paper, a novel efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) module is proposed. Focusing on retaining the information on per channel and decreasing the computational overhead, EMA groups the channel dimensions into multiple sub-features and makes the spatial semantic features well-distributed inside each feature group. Specifically, apart from encoding the global information to re-calibrate the channel-wise weight in each parallel branch, the output features of the two parallel branches are further aggregated by a cross-dimension interaction method. The extensive experiments on common-used benchmarks, such as CIFAR100 for image classification, and object detection on MS COCO and VisDrone2019 datasets, are conducted which indicate that EMA outperforms several recent attention mechanisms significantly without changing networks depth.",

This has allowed improved situational awareness and the identification of potential threats. However, it is essential that the communication between these systems to be protected against illegal access and intervention to maintain their integrity. This research study investigates whether or not it is possible to have encrypted communication in embedded systems that make use of the IoT for military purposes. It gives an overview of the many security protocols and algorithms that may be used to secure communication, along with the problems and constraints that such protocols and algorithms provide. Case studies and examples of how secure transmission has been deployed in real-world military applications are covered along with the lessons learned and best practices for moving forward with the technology's development. This article emphasizes the significance of encrypted communication in military applications and its role in protecting the safety and security of soldiers and equipment.",

        "abstract": "Flooding has often been caused by an increase in the volume of water in a water system, such as a lake or river overflowing. On rare occasions, a dam will crack, releasing a tremendous amount of water. As a result, some water seeps into the soil, ‘overflowing’ the area. Rivers are intertwined with the banks of the river at a station. Aside from a lack of items and assets, municipal architecture rainwater contains germs and wastewater flows from dumping grounds and toxic leaks, resulting in various ailments. The purpose of this research is to identify the existence of water in river beds and assess whether it is in excellent condition. If the limit is surpassed, it alerts users via LED indicators, a buzzing sound, and internet apps. First, the physical unit is installed in places that are at risk of flooding. Next, the Internet of Things module serves as the transmitting unit. Finally, the sensors on the system measure the necessary data. The precise readings are shown on the LCD and sent to the IoT web application in real time. In this case, the Thing speaks web application stores data in a private channel, and the web application subsequently warns authorities and individuals when a flood arises.",

        "abstract": "We present a memory and computation efficient ternary weight networks (TWNs) - with weights constrained to +1, 0 and -1. The Euclidian distance between full (float or double) precision weights and the ternary weights along with a scaling factor is minimized in training stage. Besides, a threshold-based ternary function is optimized to get an approximated solution which can be fast and easily computed. TWNs have shown better expressive abilities than binary precision counterparts. Meanwhile, TWNs achieve up to 16× model compression rate and need fewer multiplications compared with the float32 precision counterparts. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets show that the TWNs achieve much better result than the Binary-Weight-Networks (BWNs) and the classification performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 is very close to the full precision networks. We also verify our method on object detection task and show that TWNs significantly outperforms BWN by more than 10% mAP on PASCAL VOC dataset.

        "abstract": "Object detection algorithms play an important role in maritime search and rescue missions, where they are designed to detect people, boats and other objects in open water. However, the SeaDronesee dataset has the characteristics of small targets and large sea surface interference, which brings great challenges to general object detectors. To address these issues, we propose an improved detector YOLOv7-sea. Based on YOLOv7[2], we add a prediction head to detect tiny-scale people or objects. Besides, we integrate Simple, Parameter-Free Attention Module (SimAM) to find attention regions in the scene. To achieve further improvements to our proposed YOLOv7-sea, we provide some useful strategies such as data augmentation, Test time augmentation (TTA), and bundled box fusion (WBF). On the ODv2 challenge dataset, the AP result of YOLOv7-sea is 59.00%, which is about 7% higher than the baseline model (YOLOv7).",

        "abstract": "The article considers the problem of the influence of coal generation on the ecology of Krasnoyarsk. Coal-fired generation is one of the main sources of pollution of the city. The level of ecology reflects the quality and standard of living of the population. In the developed countries of the world, ecology is given a significant priority in solving many economic problems. The specifics of the fuel and energy balance are such that more than 90% of all energy consumption is carried out through the use of coal. When burning coal, a lot of harmful substances are released, which have a great impact on the ecology of the city. This paper presents possible solutions: 1) Raising the pipe of the combined heat and power plant (CHP); 2) Gasification of the Krasnoyarsk CHP. The issue of conducting gas in Krasnoyarsk is considered. The analysis of the above-mentioned solutions is also carried out. The calculation of the costs for lifting the pipe, as well as for gasification, was carried out. Comparative tables of \"emissions from coal and gas\" and \"costs and efficiency between pipe lifting and gasification\" are given. Based on the results of the analysis, it can be concluded that these solutions can be used.",

This article examines the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques in image classification tasks using CNNs. The paper reviews recent studies on transfer learning techniques, including their use in medical image analysis applications such as COVID-19 detection and Alzheimer’s disease classification. The study discusses the ImageNet dataset as a benchmark for pretraining CNN models and proposes an optimized CNN model that uses various optimization techniques to improve performance and efficiency. The article also includes a comparison table of various image classification techniques, including CNN, RNN, SVM, RF, and optimized CNN, with the optimized CNN offering the best performance and computational efficiency. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate technique for specific applications based on factors such as available hardware and desired tradeoff between training time and prediction time. Overall, transfer learning techniques are shown to be effective in image classification tasks, particularly when labeled data is limited.",

        "abstract": "In knowledge-based organizations, employee turnover is a significant challenge. Frequently, a company's competitive advantage can be traced back to the tacit knowledge of its employees, which is lost when those employees depart. If a company is sincere about remaining ahead of the competition, it must do everything possible to prevent its employees from leaving in droves. To comprehend the factors contributing to employee turnover in enterprises, this article examines employee turnover. The worker was assigned to one of several predetermined attrition categories primarily based on employee demographic and employment history information. Python was used to develop decision tree models and rule sets. A predictive model was constructed using the results of the developed rule sets and decision tree models to predict future employee turnover cases. Also proposed was a software application framework to implement the study's recommendations.",

        "abstract": "On November 30th, 2022, OpenAI released the large language model ChatGPT, an extension of GPT-3. The AI chatbot provides real-time communication in response to users’ requests. The quality of ChatGPT’s natural speaking answers marks a major shift in how we will use AI-generated information in our day-to-day lives. For a software engineering student, the use cases for ChatGPT are manifold: assessment preparation, translation, and creation of specified source code, to name a few. It can even handle more complex aspects of scientific writing, such as summarizing literature and paraphrasing text. Hence, this position paper addresses the need for discussion of potential approaches for integrating ChatGPT into higher education. Therefore, we focus on articles that address the effects of ChatGPT on higher education in the areas of software engineering and scientific writing. As ChatGPT was only recently released, there have been no peer-reviewed articles on the subject. Thus, we performed a structured grey literature review using Google Scholar to identify preprints of primary studies. In total, five out of 55 preprints are used for our analysis. Furthermore, we held informal discussions and talks with other lecturers and researchers and took into account the authors’ test results from using ChatGPT. We present five challenges and three opportunities for the higher education context that emerge from the release of ChatGPT. The main contribution of this paper is a proposal for how to integrate ChatGPT into higher education in four main areas.",

Temporal dependencies and relevant features are needed to identify timeseries anomalies. A GAN is trained to detect anomalies in timeseries data. The model performs better with synthetic data. Traditional ML models struggle with the difficulties of anomaly identification in time-series data due to issues such as dealing with high dimensionality, capturing temporal correlations, and detecting infrequent events with skewed class distributions. This study tested machine learning techniques for anomaly identification in time-series data using the Yahoo! Webscope S5 dataset. In terms of F1 score (0.912), precision (0.S99), recall (0.925), AUC-ROC (0.976), TP rate (0.925), and FP rate (0.045), the suggested approach beat the baseline methods. The suggested method uses GANs to generate synthetic data for anomaly identification in time-series data.",

        "abstract": "In order to the increase the popularity of Electric Vehicles in the community the vital component i.e. Charging stations should be properly developed so as they give seamless, reliable service to the customers. With the advancement of technology, the number of electric cars increased, necessitating an increase in the number of charging stations. A charging station prototype is an intelligent device that utilizes automation technologies to handle the whole electrical infrastructure. It is constructed with the latest automation technologies, including a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and a graphical user interface (GUI). This section discusses automated electric car charging systems. To enable tethered charging, a completely automated system facilitates the whole procedure. Our final year project, the Advanced Charging Station, addresses this issue directly. This report contains comprehensive information on this project, including specifics about the equipment and components used to construct it. Additionally, the report details the project's operation and key variables in plain language that is intelligible to the common individual. The chapters are organized in such a way that it is simpler for readers to grasp the idea of our project. We trust that we have communicated our opinions in this report in the most suitable manner possible by thoroughly discussing each issue and also by removing any concerns or complaints from the reader's mind.",

        "abstract": "The phrase \"personality\" refers to an individual's distinct mode of thought, action, and behaviour Personality is a collection of feelings, thoughts, and aspirations that may be seen in the way people interact with one another. Behavioural features that separate one person from another and may be clearly seen when interacting with individuals in one's immediate surroundings and social group are included in this category of traits. To improve good healthy discourse, a variety of ways for evaluating candidate personalities based on the meaning of their textual message have been developed. According to the research, the textual content of interview responses to conventional interview questions is an effective measure for predicting a person's personality attribute. Nowadays, personality prediction has garnered considerable interest. It analyses user activity and displays their ideas, feelings, and so on. Historically, defining a personality trait was a laborious process. Thus, automated prediction is required for a big number of users. Different algorithms, data sources, and feature sets are used in various techniques. As a way to gauge someone's personality, personality prediction has evolved into an important topic of research in both psychology and computer science. Candidate personality traits may be classified using a word embedding model, which is the subject of this article.",

        "abstract": "Object detection algorithms must first identify all the objects inside an image before machine vision can properly categorize and localize them. Many methods have been proposed to handle this problem, with most of the motivation coming from computer vision and deep learning methods. However, prevailing technologies have never effectively recognized tiny, dense things and often failed to detect objects that have undergone random geometric alterations. We analyze the current state of the art in object identification and propose a deformable convolutional network with adjustable depths to address these concerns. The results of our research suggest that they are better than the current best practices, blend deep convolutional networks with flexible convolutional structures to account for geometric variations, and get multi-scaled features. Next, we perform the remaining phases of object identification and region regress by up-sampling the fusion of multi-scaled elements. Experimental validation of our proposed framework demonstrates a considerable improvement in accuracy relative to time spent recognizing small target objects with geometric distortion.",

        "abstract": "Motion-based association for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has recently re-achieved prominence with the rise of powerful object detectors. Despite this, little work has been done to incorporate appearance cues beyond simple heuristic models that lack robustness to feature degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel way to leverage objects’ appearances to adaptively integrate appearance matching into existing high-performance motion-based methods. Building upon the pure motion-based method OC-SORT, we achieve 1st place on MOT20 and 2nd place on MOT17 with 63.9 and 64.9 HOTA, respectively. We also achieve 61.3 HOTA on the challenging DanceTrack benchmark as a new state-of-the-art even compared to more heavily-designed methods.

        "abstract": "Android Security has become a frequently targeted area by cyber attackers and is widely exploited for several benefits by unauthorized users. The open-source model and affordable access to Android platforms enable smartphone users with multiple free applications and on the other hand, the same platform can be misused by attackers to achieve their goals. Android Ransomware attack is one of the majorly used attacks in the android malware domain and can affect android users with huge information and financial losses. Smartphone users store their personal to professional all kind of information in their smartphones and data breaches from the same source can put them in harmful circumstances. This research article focuses on android ransomware network architecture for detailed analysis and forming a further roadmap for the detection of such attacks. With technological capabilities, the detection of ransomware attacks at an early stage can secure from at least some levels of losses. Threat intelligence can be created using artificial intelligence-based methods for android malware attacks, but that requires clear identification of attributes and features that are involved in a particular cyberattack. In this experimental study, we have worked on CIC-AndMal2017 dataset that is being created by generating android malware attacks on real smartphones. We targeted the android ransomware attacks from this dataset and performed detailed exploratory data analysis to conclude the behaviour of different android ransomware attacks. The results drawn from this experimental study help the researcher to build artificial intelligence-based ransomware detection methodologies for the android platform.",

In order to solve a problem, learning is accomplished with the aid of episodic memory, which stores previous experiences as episodes. This study illustrates the improvement in intelligence with the use of the application of an example in soar. Working memory elements (WMEs), which are episodes (past experiences) in the form, are discussed in this paper as a means of enhancing intelligence. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that knowledge always leads to performance improvement, meaning that as an agent studies more, performance will extend.",

For a novelty to be accepted by users, adopted by other organisations, economic actors and widely used, it needs to be a resounding success. Innovative initiatives affect all sectors of the economy, and education is no exception. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the role of innovative projects and their perception by users through the example of a project considered to be an international example. The project will be presented from the users’ point of view, from the stakeholders’ point of view, through some characteristics of the project scope, highlighting the factors that make it usable and attractive, based on the results of a questionnaire survey.",

Healthcare in the twenty-first century brings a variety of difficulties (population growth and rising healthcare costs). Compared to the conventional medical system, agent technology can offer superior healthcare for that. Agents in the hospital might deal with a variety of medical issues. We list collaboration across hospital wards, the development of diagnostics, the gathering of patient data, etc. as examples of issues that arise in hospitals. These issues can be resolved with a cooperative This paper proposes a generic architecture that integrates swarm intelligence with multi-agent healthcare systems to provide therapy as efficiently as possible.",

The use of modern information technology can significantly improve the healthcare system. As ubiquitous computing for novel healthcare systems, services, and applications became more closely linked to Cloud systems, the applications needed environments that were scalable, dependable, and secure, and containerized environments provided the right solutions.As the usage of,eHealth solutions advances new computer paradigms, such as cloud computing, have the potential to boost efficiency in storing medical health information while also lowering costs.In developing and underdeveloped nations, traditional analysis-based healthcare systems are still in use. Even though very few organisations use computer-based applications, doctors, and the government were unable to create a widespread network A heterogeneous network can be built using the new technology of cloud computing to enhance the system. In this process,a cloud-based application with an integrated strategy and patients has been created to upgrade an antiquated healthcare system. Using this method, enormous numbers of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) will be saved every day.Furthermore, this way of developing an eHealth system ensures patient data privacy in the cloud.The platform presented here can be improve of a variety of cloud computing infrastructures that provide standardised, adaptive, and customised services for eHealth systems. The performance of this analysis is calculated on different aspects such as Accuracy, Precision, and Specificity. Though the outcomes for various methods are different,an integrated approach to improve eHealthcare System using dynamic Cloud Computing Platform will be the best results in this analysis.",

        "abstract": "In today's era of technology a control system without an automation is worthless and not that much efficient. A control system must be integrated with an automation to conduct the day-to-day challenging task in an easy way and can save a time and cost of manual operation. In India some of the farmers are using their own techniques of smart farming. But in some areas smart farming is not yet developed due to less knowledge about the technology. Some farmers are using the technologies that can increase the crop yield directly but in some scenarios crop yield can be increased by using some indirect ways. Some of them are borewell charging, poly house water management automation, submersible motor automation, etc. in our survey we found that if farmers are using a new technology there are some misleading concepts, they have regarding it so to nullify the problem of farmers we are introducing a smart device that can be used to automate the motor starter remotely.",

        "abstract": "Most machine learning models have had tremendous success in implementing prediction analysis on dePD end diseases such as brain tumors, making it an ambitious goal to apply machine learning to medical research discoveries. In the case of Parkinson's disease, for example, early diagnosis and understanding might allow patients to adopt preventative measures before the onset of clinical symptoms. In cases when no effective therapies exist, machine learning mPDe provides a means of making an early diagnosis and thereby improving patient outcomes. A loss of brain function, like in the case of Dementia, impairs the ability of the rest of the body to function normally. In medicine, the application of machine learning models is known as “quantum intelligence,” and it is used to determine which drug combinations work best. In terms of technology and automation, quantum computing or intelligence is among the highest. We're attempting to apply quantum intelligence to a dataset about Parkinson's disease. Models of machine learning and deep learning, such as random forests, decision trees, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and so on, are applied to a variety of generic datasets. OASIS is a specialized neuroimaging dataset with a variety of MRI patient dimensions. This can be incorporated into future studies. We are employing 3D brain pictures to diagnose the tumour using machine learning models, and MRI has multiple facets to be taken into account before arriving at a diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has two variations, known as T1 and T2. When it comes to fMRI, PET, and similar technologies, we've got you covered. Decision trees and random forest algorithms from machine learning, along with neural networks and RNNs from deep learning, were used to attain the desired accuracy.",

        "abstract": "While Wav2Vec 2.0 has been proposed for speech recognition (ASR), it can also be used for speech emotion recognition (SER); its performance can be significantly improved using different fine-tuning strategies. Two baseline methods, vanilla fine-tuning (V-FT) and task adaptive pretraining (TAPT) are first presented. We show that V-FT is able to outperform state-of-the-art models on the IEMOCAP dataset. TAPT, an existing NLP fine-tuning strategy, further improves the performance on SER. We also introduce a novel fine-tuning method termed P-TAPT, which modifies the TAPT objective to learn contextualized emotion representations. Experiments show that P-TAPT performs better than TAPT, especially under low-resource settings. Compared to prior works in this literature, our top-line system achieved a 7.4% absolute improvement in unweighted accuracy (UA) over the state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP.

The proposed design consists of multiple concentric rings. The lower S-band dual-band response has been generated with the help of top and bottom mirror geometry. The proposed structure has a size of 14 × 14 mm2 and provides dual-band responses at 3.0 GHz and 3.87 GHz. The first band response is from 2.85 − 3.18 GHz, the second band response is from 3.84−3.99 GHz, and the stop-band, appears from 3.8−3.96 GHz. The proposed geometry is designed in such a way that the responses can be shifted by controlling a single parameter. Further, the proposed geometry is polarization insensitive. The proposed transparent compact FSS is applicable for various S-band dual-band pass wireless applications.",

        "abstract": "The assessment of a patient’s blood sample is a critical obligation in the healthcare industry. Different health problems are caused by aberrant blood cell growth. One of the vital elements of blood are white blood cells (WBC). Manually identifying WBC under a microscope requires a significant amount of time and effort, and this procedure is susceptible to human error, which might result in wrong interpretation. The automated systems for recognizing and categorizing the various types of WBC have major medicinal applications in this field. Despite the fact that the deep convolution neural network method gave decent results for categorizing WBC images. In the proposed study, a CNN-based deep learning algorithm is used to identify WBC. The dataset contains a variety of white blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes. The CNN model was tested using multiple optimizers with batch sizes of 32 and 10 epochs. For the CNN model study, performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy were employed. The suggested model’s greatest accuracy is 93%. The proposed methodology provides exact and speedy results, which may assist save patients’ lives.",

        "abstract": "Masked Autoencoder (MAE) has recently been shown to be effective in pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) for natural image analysis. By reconstructing full images from partially masked inputs, a ViT encoder aggregates contextual information to infer masked image regions. We believe that this context aggregation ability is particularly essential to the medical image domain where each anatomical structure is functionally and mechanically connected to other structures and regions. Because there is no ImageNet-scale medical image dataset for pre-training, we investigate a self pre-training paradigm with MAE for medical image analysis tasks. Our method pre-trains a ViT on the training set of the target data instead of another dataset. Thus, self pre-training can benefit more scenarios where pre-training data is hard to acquire. Our experimental results show that MAE self pre-training markedly improves diverse medical image tasks including chest X-ray disease classification, abdominal CT multi-organ segmentation, and MRI brain tumor segmentation.

        "abstract": "Music has a unique emotional connection with humans. It is a means of connecting individuals from all over the world. On the other hand, it is a highly difficult task to generalize music and claim that everyone would prefer and enjoy the same type. Emotion-based music selection is important because it can assist humans in reducing stress. Its major purpose is to accurately predict the user’s emotions, and play songs depending on the user’s preferences. Using Human Computer Interaction (HCI), the proposed bot recognizes human emotions from facial emotions. Another significant challenge is the extraction of facial features from the user’s face. The proposed CNN Algorithm is utilized in the proposed model to properly capture and recognize the user’s face from the live webcam stream and to detect emotions based on facial factors such as lips and eyes. Also, an additional option will be provided for people to make a good choice manually.",

        "abstract": "Recently, omnidirectional wireless power transfer (WPT) has gained extensive attention globally. However, it is difficult to integrate such system with common home furniture for its three-dimensional (3-D) structure, which degrades its practicality. Targeting at this challenge, this article proposes a novel planar omnidirectional WPT system, enabling 3-D omnidi-rectional WPT for consumer electronics, such as mobile phones and earphones. It consists of three sets of planar coils, which can generate magnetic field in three dimensions, enabling the receiver to be charged in all positions and orientations. Besides, the decoupling performance of the proposed coil structure is verified. Afterwards, a LCCL-LC resonant converter is utilized to achieve the constant output voltage gain at resonant frequency. Finally, in the experiment, three sets of coils are integrated as PCB windings and the magnetic field is measured to verify the omnidirectional magnetic field distribution under 6.78MHz. When charging a 5-W receiver for portable devices, the output voltage will be between 16-24V while the overall efficiency is 70%-72.5% with $x$ and $y$ misalignment. Considering the angular misalignment, the efficiency remains between 28%-53%.",

        "abstract": "This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of emerging technologies in networking, focusing on caching in Information-Centric Networking (ICN), context-aware radio access technology (RAT) selection in 5G ultra-dense networks, cryptocurrency adoption, and mobility support for routing in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). Adaptive RAT selection mechanisms are stressed in 5G context-aware RAT selection. RAT selection processes address context acquisition, decision-making algorithms, and resource allocation. 5G context-aware RAT selection study is suggested. The report then discusses bitcoin adoption, including its current state and benefits. Scalability, security, and regulation are difficulties. Future studies should address these issues and increase cryptocurrency adoption. Finally, LLN mobility support investigates routing techniques for mobility needs. LLN reactive and proactive routing protocols are analyzed. LLN routing mobility support research is suggested. This survey article discusses techniques, difficulties, and future research by summarizing each technology. To help researchers and practitioners make educated judgments and enhance networking technologies.",

        "abstract": "Advanced artificial-intelligence (Al) edge devices require high energy-efficiency $(\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}})$ and high inference-accuracy [2,4-6]. An SRAM-based compute-in-memory (CIM) based on MAC operations is well-suited for improving the $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$ of Al edge devices. However, without support for floating-point (FP) computation, Al chips using integer-based SRAM-CIMs (INT-CIM) [2,4-5] are prone to precision loss when applied to complex datasets or neural network models. Product $(\\text{PD}=\\text{IN}\\times \\mathrm{W})$. alignment-based FP-MACs align the product's mantissa $(\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{M}})$ prior to accumulation, based on the product's exponent $(\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}})$. This approach is commonly used for digital circuits [3] and for near-memory compute [1], but is not practical for in-memory-compute (IMC) macros: each $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}$ within a physical row/column is different and thus cannot be accumulated. An INT-IMC with off-macro digital circuits and off-chip software pre-alignment was used in [6] to process the exponents of inputs $(\\text{IN}_{\\mathrm{E}})$ and weights $(\\mathrm{W}_{\\mathrm{E}})$ externally for the FP-MAC. An INT-CIM with extra FP-to-INT converters can emulate an FP-MAC, but incurs additional area, power consumption, and latency (PPA). Researchers have yet to develop a true FP-IMC macro capable of exponent and mantissa computation. Analog CIMs suffer from a low readout accuracy due to intrinsic transistor variation. Digital CIMs are insensitive to variation, but are limited in terms of compute parallelism due to routing congestion, as Fig. 7.1.1 shows. This paper presents a true FP-IMC macro featuring (1) a hybrid-domain macro structure that enables computation of both the exponent and mantissa in an FP-MAC within the same IMC macro. A high $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$ and accuracy are achieved by exploiting advantages of computing in the time, digital, and analog-voltage domain by identifying the proper functional blocks for the FP-MAC [2,4-5]. (2) Time-domain based $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}$ generation, a $\\text{maximum}-\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}(\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}-\\text{MAX}})$ finder (TD-MPEF), and a $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}-\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}-\\text{MAX}}$ generator $(\\text{TD}-\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}-\\text{DG})$ to achieve a high $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$ for all exponent computation. (3) $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{E}}$ -based input-mantissa alignment (PEB-IMA) scheme to enable accumulation for $\\text{PD}_{\\mathrm{M}}$ in the same column. (4) A place-value dependent digital/analog-hybrid computing scheme for mantissa computation with a high inference accuracy and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$. A 22-nm 832-kb FP SRAM-IMC macro is fabricated using foundry-provided compact-6T SRAM cells. The FP SRAM-IMC support FP-MACs with 128-accumulators (ACCU) for BF16 inputs (IN) and weights (W) with FP32 outputs (OUT) and achieves the highest reported FP-MAC $\\eta_{\\mathrm{E}}$, 70.2TFLOPS/W.",

        "abstract": "Traditional models for predicting diseases in sugarcane crops show some drawbacks, including expensive costs for getting the data input needed to execute the model, a lack of spatial data, or a poor dataset. These problems are discussed in this work, which also develops a yield prediction fusion model. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM). make up the prediction model.In this work, the leaf smut infection of sugarcane is discussed. The sick plant is first photographed utilizing secondary sources. For feature extraction and classification of the various levels of severity of the smut infection, the best features of the deep learning techniques CNN and SVM are applied. Mild, Average, Severe, and Profound are the four seriousness prediction levels used in the study. Mendeley and Kaggle are the data repositories that were utilized, and the total size of the dataset was 950. The four severity level forecasts made by the suggested framework are 98% accurate.",

It remains a great challenge for bottom-up design of MRAM-CIM macro using the standard one transistor - one magnetic tunnel junction (1T-1MTJ) bit-cell: (1) The mainstream spin-transfer-torque (STT) switching mechanism with a standard foundry bit-cell cannot fulfill CIM operation requirements in binary neural networks (BNN). (2) The excessive multi-row/column activation method suffers from a limited read window due to the limited tunnel magnetoresistance ratio and process variation [1], [2].

The proposed topology can be viewed as a 2-to-1 SC converter merged with two 8-to-1 series-capacitor-buck (SCB) modules through two switching buses. Different from the conventional DC bus architecture, the switching bus architecture removes the bulky DC bus capacitors and reduces the number of switches. Compared with existing 48-to-1-V hybrid SC demonstrations, the proposed converter achieves the highest SC stage conversion ratio with the lowest normalized switch volt-ampere (VA) rating, which promises lightened conversion burden on the following buck stage and reduced switch stress. A hardware prototype is designed, constructed and tested up to 500-A output current, achieving 94.7% peak power stage efficiency, 86.4% full-load efficiency and 464-W/in3 power density.",

        "abstract": "This research aims to develop a Machine Learning model for predicting soil moisture levels, which may be used to construct smart irrigation systems. The model was evaluated and trained using data from the “Smart Irrigation System Dataset” made publicly available by the University of California, Irvine. A transfer-learned ResNet50 model is evaluated using various classification measures like accuracy, recall, precision, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The proposed model has an AUC of 0.95, meaning it correctly identifies positive and negative samples 95% of the time. Moreover, the model’s performance is measured against that of other famous machine learning models like logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), random forests, decision trees, and naive Bayes, with the majority of these conventional models being outperformed. These findings have ramifications for researchers and engineers creating intelligent irrigation systems for precision agriculture.",

        "abstract": "In numerous locations, hardware switches are utilized to control various equipment like household devices, industrial devices, etc. The use of physical switches has drawbacks, induding the risk of electric shocks from structural damage and the expense of replacement due to wear and tear. The proposed model replaces switches with a virtual environment, and an image processing technique is deployed to collect the visual data to control various devices utilizing electromagnetic relays. In this work, Dynamic Vision Sensor is used as a bioinspired sensor which replaces the physical switch. In essence, electromagnetic relays are utilized for device control. Further, the raspberry controller uses a transmitter and receiver pair to wirelessly communicate data to it, so that it can control devices by activating and deactivating electromagnetic relays. This reduces the need for wiring and hence lowers the cost of wiring. Since the proposed concept is not a physical device, it also prevents the risk of shock whenever the structure is compromised. It is also transportable, and a 2D projector can be utilized to create a virtual environment on any flat surface.",

        "abstract": "Over 2.4 % of deaths in India each year are caused by liver diseases. Due to its mild early signs, liver disease is also challenging to diagnose. Frequently, the signs only become obvious when it is too late. Even more challenging than segmenting the liver is segmenting the tumour from the liver. Imaging procedures like computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound are utilised to separate the liver and liver tumour once a sample of liver tissue has been removed. This research suggests a machine learning method from CT images-based automatic assistance system for stage categorization. Then, the features are extracted from the CT images using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method. Finally, it is suggested that the computed tomography (CT) pictures of livers containing tumours be categorised using a Random Forest technique. Using the described method, liver tumour images are classified as benign or malignant. The real value accuracy for liver segmentation was found to be approximately 99.55%, 97.85%, and 98.16% based on the experimental investigation. Using the described method, liver tumour images are classified as benign or malignant. These modifications improve the system’s ability to recognise the tumour from the CT pictures.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer poses a major hazard to women, with high morbidity and fatality rates, because there is a lack of reliable prognostic models, clinicians find it challenging to develop a treatment regimen that could increase patient life expectancy. There are required to detect breast cancer early stages so the necessary steps should be taken as early as possible to stop this disease first we need more research in this field. So, in this work, we are trying to build a sustainable machine-learning model which can detect the type of breast cancer whether benign or malignant. Through the detection, we proposed the best model which can detect this outbreak efficiently. In our study, we examined the performance of five machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) in predicting human health behavior. Among these algorithms, XGBoost had the highest accuracy (95.42%) and performed well in terms of sensitivity (98.5%), specificity (97.5%), and F-1 score (99%). Our findings suggest that XGBoost has promising potential in predicting breast cancer, but further research is needed to develop and apply it for commercial use in the healthcare industry.",

        "abstract": "In Al-edge devices, the changes of input features are normally progressive or occasional, e.g., abnormal surveillance, hence the reprocessing of unchanged data consumes a tremendously redundant amount of energy. Computing-in-memory (CIM) directly executes matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in memory, eliminating costly data movement energy in deep neural networks (DNNs) [2–6]. Prior CIM work only explored the sparsity of DNNs to improve energy efficiency, but the trend of employing non-sparse activation functions, e.g., leaky ReLU, degrade the benefits of leveraging sparsity [1]. Even if sparsity can be exploited, the redundant unchanged input features in analog CIM still consume massive amount of dynamic power (Fig. 7.8.1). From a circuit point-of-view, the energy consumption of analog CIMs is dominated by full-precision ADCs. In different DNN applications, the mean of analog CIM outputs is unpredictable and fluctuating, which requires the ADC to have a high dynamic range to guarantee coverage, introducing a high-power overhead.",

The depletion of traditional natural resources in today’s fast-changing world has virtually eliminated the former engine of economic growth, and a new approach is needed to enable economic actors to cope with the new environment. New solutions are the only way to overcome the anomaly of natural resources. It is essential that all economic actors, from micro to large enterprises, can play their part in this process. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the conditions are created in the near future to promote and stimulate innovation. The aim of this study is to present the Hungarian SME sector’s view on the factors that stimulate innovation, assessing the potential characteristics that can contribute to these processes and behaviours.",

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been tremendous progress in creating synthetic media, mainly thanks to the development of powerful methods based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). Very recently, methods based on diffusion models (DM) have been gaining the spotlight. In addition to providing an impressive level of photorealism, they enable the creation of text-based visual content, opening up new and exciting opportunities in many different application fields, from arts to video games. On the other hand, this property is an additional asset in the hands of malicious users, who can generate and distribute fake media perfectly adapted to their attacks, posing new challenges to the media forensic community. With this work, we seek to understand how difficult it is to distinguish synthetic images generated by diffusion models from pristine ones and whether current state-of-the-art detectors are suitable for the task. To this end, first we expose the forensics traces left by diffusion models, then study how current detectors, developed for GAN-generated images, perform on these new synthetic images, especially in challenging social-network scenarios involving image compression and resizing.

The existing systems like K-mean clustering technique and the neural network can detect only 80-90% of illnesses. Using computer vision and machine learning approaches, this research suggests an innovative and effective method for identifying crop pathology. The proposed approach uses the object detection technique's experimental solution, known as YOLO, to find plant disease. YOLO processes leaf images at a real-time rate of 45 frames per second, which is quicker than existing object detection methods. Before processing the image, it divides the image into a number of grid cells. A single neural network can forecast the bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single assessment. With the use of the proposed algorithm, farmers will be able to identify diseases in their early stages, diagnose leaf diseases, and then control the crop as needed to maintain the health and safety of plants.",

        "abstract": "Smart homes have grown in popularity not only as a luxury but also because of the numerous benefits they provide. In this research, a home automation system is developed for the elders because as the number of elders rises, so does the probability that patients will develop geriatric problems, which necessitates society to address the issue. It is especially beneficial for senior citizens and disabled youngsters. Many research and innovation are conducting on in the field of gestures recognition. In this project, home automation is performed through the use of gestures to control appliances and contradicting the computer vision approaches as an elder person is not capable for ensuring the environment for the computer vision techniques as it requires proper lightning conditions and angle to ensure the parameters. Sensor embedded Hand glove that collects hand motions has been discussed in this study. The wearable device detects and records tilting, rotation, and acceleration of the hand movement using accelerometers and gyroscopes. Our proposed human gestures recognition (HGR) system recognizes nine different hand gestures taken from benchmarked dataset. We used a combination of features extraction algorithms and a random forest classifier to compare our system's performance with other well-known classifiers. We have achieved an accuracy of 94% over the benchmark HGR dataset. Experiments have shown that the proposed approach has the capability to recognize gestures for controlling home appliances and can be used in healthcare, residences, offices, and educational environments.",

        "abstract": "As conventional energy resources are depleting; the world is moving towards renewable energy sources to fulfill the power requirement. The most commonly used renewable energy source is solar and PV systems, which have attained great importance as a source linked to transmission networks. PV systems, when integrated with grids, create power quality problems due to using nonlinear electronic devices. To improve power quality, filters are necessary to clear out the harmonics and distortion and to improve the power factor improvement. SAPF (Shunt Active Power Filter) is needed to cancel out the system's undesired signals to balance the imbalance currents and reactive power compensation. SAHF (Shunt Active Harmonic Filter) is required for compensation of harmonics by producing equal but 180° in phase current. In this paper, PV based SAHF is analyzed with the help of MATLAB/ SIMULINK to reduce the current harmonics and provide load compensation. To extract maximal power, P&O (Perturbation & Observation) based technique is needed. The SAHF is created with VSI, and a controller offers a triggering signal for VSI (Voltage Source Inverter). This paper contains the system analysis with and without SAHF, and THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) is measured using the FFT (Fast Fourier Technique) technique.",

        "abstract": "Coronary artery disorder is the heart disease that is prevalent across the globe today. It's a serious issue for the humans as it requires proper diagnosis. Coronary artery disease develops over time as a result of plaque build- up in coronary arteries results in partial blockage of blood flow as the, which is primarily composed of cholesterol, calcium, and fibrin. Coronary arteries help human heart to pump oxygen-rich blood throughout the body by supplying it. However, appropriate diagnosis and early prediction will lessen the likelihood of developing it. This study explores the possibility of foreseeing cardiac illness at an early stage using deep learning algorithms. This study's primary goal is to properly determine whether a person has heart problems or not. by using deep learning techniques, Deep learning and various machine learning algorithms can both be used to implement early-stage prediction. Data mining, Decision trees, Naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are some examples through which it can be implemented. The research is going to be done using ANN Model.",

Accurate estimating of the air quality index(AQI) is essential for effective pollution control. In this research, an AQI prediction ANFIS network model was created utilizing an already-existing data set. In this instance, the ANFIS system compares the performances of the back propagation neural network model, hybrid models, the Gaussian-BNN model, and the Gaussian-hybrid BNN model. Based on the actual raw data set, it was noted that the R and IA values of the Gaussian hybrid model are 0.9899. The ANFIS gauss-hybrid model might therefore be used to predict the most accurate model data.",

        "abstract": "Future communication systems are expected to employ Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for real-time manipulation of channel to achieve unprecedented efficiency and quality of service (QoS) improvement. Here, we have designed a practical RIS-enabled communication setup to demonstrate beam steering and multi-beam forming in near-to far-field trials. The design of RIS as a component of wireless communication system has many variables that dictate path loss compensation capability of RIS. We investigate RIS path loss compensation by varying RIS size with point source and plane wave source using a 1-bit RIS of size $27\\times 28$ unit-cells. It is observed that RIS size has less significance compared to phase quantization, in the near field while the effect of RIS size is dominant in the far field. The reported results provide useful insights for design of RIS-enabled wireless communication systems.",

Because of this, the hackers are taking advantage of the opportunity to use the emails as their secret weapons against the email users. The hackers send a bulk of emails at a time with a single click. The majority of spam mail contains advertisements or promotions for various events, utilities, appliances, and so on. A single Spam email results in a net loss for the user. Even with current technology, there are numerous techniques and methods for distinguishing between spam and ham mail, but spammers are finding ways to get the user's attention and developing themselves due to the decreased effectiveness of techniques. So, our study comes up with effective classifiers in this paper. In this research paper, ML and deep learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Long Short-Term Memory, and Bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory are used to identify which model is more accurate to classify the emails as spam or ham.",

SRAM computing-in-memory (CIM) and digital processors suffer large $\\mathsf{E}_{\\mathsf{WK-RP}}$ and long $\\mathsf{T}_{\\mathsf{WK-RP}}$ due to the movement of weight data from off-chip NVM to the on-chip buffer and processing unit after wakeup. Thus, on-chip nonvolatile CIM (nvCIM) is preferred for Al-edge processors by combining NVM storage and computing tasks on the same macro. Among nvCIM structures, in-memory compute (IMC) [1] provides short computing latency and high energy efficiency, but suffers from low computing yield. Near-memory compute (NMC) [2–4] provides high computing yield, but suffers long computing latency and low energy efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The medical field and other research areas fields heavily rely on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Hand gesture recognition (HGR), which is a straightforward approach for interacting with machines, has drawn the attention of numerous researchers in the context of AI. Utilizing ML technique, HGR is carried out. Both the image technique and the design approach are parts of it. In the image technique, the hand picture is rebuilt utilizing the attributes of the images. However, when using the model-based approach, the image is recreated using many models, including volumetric, geometric, and others. The key difficulty in gesture control continues to be the ML individual's complexity and preparation time. Its accuracy is used to assess the HGR accuracy. Its precision is used to assess the HGR overall system performance. The many techniques and algorithms utilized in gesture control are covered in detail inside this work.",

        "abstract": "The majority of the people in India dependent on farming to earn a living. As a due to climate change, farmers face various challenges. One of them is a reduction in yield, and one of the causes of that is the development of diseases in the plant. The main economic agricultural activity is a banana plantation, particularly in Asian and African nations. Feature extraction using CNN and SVM was used to identify and classify the banana fruit leaf diseases. The dataset was initially improved, precompiled using Matlab code, and then divided into training and testing sections. During the conduct of this research, the ratio employed to divide the data into training and validation was 80:20. After the CNN was implemented successfully, and the SVM models, the maximum average accuracy measured was 94%. According to this study, the suggested model achieves the automatic right diagnosis of banana leaf diseases and gives a workable method for the detection of crop leaf diseases with high recognition accuracy.",

Today, education is becoming a joint venture between the state, the market, and the community. Alternative education and training providers that place a greater emphasis on employability provide a problem, and university professors represent a particular breed of career academics that remain cut off from developments in the outside world. The sentiment analysis of student comments is presented in this work using a combination of Methodologies based on lexicons and machine learning. The textual feedback, which is often gathered around the conclusion of a semester, offers helpful insights into the general quality of teaching and makes insightful recommendations for ways to enhance instructional design. The article describes a sentiment analysis model trained using TF-IDF and linguistic characteristics to look at the opinions expressed by participants in their textual feedback. Additionally, a comparison among the existing sentiment analysis techniques is done.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) system is facing a large number of attacks nowadays. Distributed Denial of Ser-vices(DDoS) attack is the most reported attack in the field of security. Nowadays these attacks are increasing very rapidly. However, it has been difficult to predict and detect these attacks easily. In this paper, various existing machine learning (ML) algorithms are being analyzed that are used to predict and detect DDoS attacks using different existing datasets namely; ToN-IoT, CICDDoS2019 and BoT-IoT. The four types of different ML algorithms have been deployed which include K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Naive Bayes(NB), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF). The major goal of this analysis is to choose the best ML technique. Comparing the existing BoT-IoT dataset to the other datasets utilised in this paper, provides the best measure. The evaluation findings demonstrate that the decision tree and random forest classifiers provide the highest levels of accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the security concerns associated with DDoS attacks and their mitigation.",

It has led to the development of a number of new solutions, tools and strategies that have significantly transformed marketing practice through their global and local impact. In the theoretical framework of this paper, I will focus on the consumer trend of digitalisation and its impact on communication. One of the great added value of digitalisation is the generation of customised content, the possibility to use customised marketing solutions, which has greatly expanded the range of target group-specific techniques. I analyzed consumer perceptions of digital communication habits and digital content in the light of primary data. The study also focuses on the differences in digital communication habits by generation and gender in the statistical evaluation of primary research results. I argue that the differentiated approach is of practical use, as the results shed light on consumer differences and possible segments in digital content and communication habits.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based high-speed target-identification and tracking is a critical application in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with wide military and commercial usage. Traditional frame cameras processed through convolutional neural networks (CNN) exhibit high target-identification accuracy but with low throughput (hence low tracking speed) and high power. On the other hand, event cameras or dynamic vision sensors (DVS) generate a stream of binary asynchronous events corresponding to the changing intensity of the pixels capturing high-speed temporal information, characteristic of high-speed tracking. Such event streams with high spatial sparsity processed with bio-mimetic spiking neural networks (SNN) provide low power consumption and high throughput. However, the accuracy of object detection using such event cameras and SNNs is limited. Thus, a frame pipeline with a CNN and an event pipeline with a SNN (Fig. 29.5.1) possess complementary strengths in capturing and processing the spatial and temporal details, respectively. Hence, a hybrid network that fuses frame data processed using a CNN pipeline with event data processed through an SNN pipeline provides a platform for high-speed, high-accuracy and low-power target-identification and tracking. To address this need, we present a fully-programmable heterogeneous ARM Cortex-based SoC with an in-memory low-power RRAM-based CNN and a near-memory high-speed SRAM-based SNN in a hybrid architecture with applications in high-speed target identification and tracking.",

The LiNbO3 resonator employs a novel bilayer periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) 128º Y-cut LiNbO3 on amorphous silicon (a-Si) on sapphire stack to achieve low losses and high coupling at millimeter wave (mm-wave). The device also shows a Q of 159, k2 of 65.06%, and FoM of 103.4 for the 16.99 GHz tone. This result shows promising prospects of P3F LiNbO3 towards mm-wave front-end filters.",

Government organizations may also take proactive measures to protect the environment by accurately anticipating pollution levels in real time. In future smart cities, we propose using the Internet of Things and machine learning to track pollution levels in the air we breathe. The Pearson correlation test is performed to see whether pollutants and meteorological indicators have a high link. A cloud-centric IoT middleware architecture is used in this research instead of a standard sensor network to gather data from both air pollution and current weather sensors. This means that both reliability and cost have been greatly improved. Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Particulate Matter levels were predicted using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (PM2.5). The positive results show that ANNs may be used to monitor and forecast air pollution. RMSE values of 0.0128 and 0.0001 for SO2 and PM2.5 were found using our models.",

        "abstract": "Every year, drunk driving injures and sometimes kills a number of people. It is critical to investigate an IoT-based alcohol detection system for safe mobility. Because it uses sensors and a microprocessor to monitor the driver’s BAC and cuts off the car’s ignition if it suspects that the driver has been drinking while driving, this system can detect and prevent drunk driving. The proposed system will use IoT to remotely monitor and analyze the driver’s Blood Alcohol Level (BAC). A communication module, a microprocessor, and an alcohol sensor comprise the system. The communication component sends real-time data to a BAC server for monitoring and analysis. The proposed strategy reduces the likelihood of accidents, improves driver and passenger safety, and lowers the likelihood of transportation companies having to pay for injuries or damages. IoT-based technologies that detect alcohol can aid in the prevention of drunk driving. By monitoring drivers’ BACs in real time and discouraging drunk driving, this device has the potential to significantly reduce traffic-related injuries and fatalities.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things has rapidly gained popularity in recent years, and one of the most exciting applications of this technology is in the development of smart homes. A smart home is a residence that uses IoT devices and technology to automate and control various aspects of the home, such as lighting, heating, and security. One of the key benefits of using IoT in a smart home is the ability to improve the efficiency and convenience of daily life. IoT-enabled devices can automatically adjust the temperature and lighting in a home based on the time of day and the presence of occupants, saving energy, and providing a more comfortable living environment. This study has developed a smart home application that notifies users' APIs of an object's status via messages. Every time, the light bulb is turned ON by using an application and a signal is sent from the Arduino software code to the Wi-Fi module, which turns ON the light bulb. Next, the status of the light bulb is sent to Java, where the written code helps to share the status with other users by using the WhatsApp or Telegram APIs.",

In this study, we improve the settings of PID using a genetic algorithm and an ANFIS-style technique. The outputs of the suggested Genetic & ANFIS-PID controller are superior to those of the traditional PID controllers in terms of overshoots and settling times. A thorough analysis utilizing the MATLAB-Simulink program confirms the efficiency of the suggested plan.",

The integration of machine learning perception and enhanced motion based on the dragonfly algorithm (MLP-EBMDA) has been the primary focus of the research. The suggested system has been assessed through number of factors, recall, accuracy rate, F1-score, and precision. After execution of the algorithm, the precision, f1-score, recall, accuracy, and sensitivity of the proposed MLP-EBMDA are each 87%. The accuracy of the MLP-EBMDA-based informative entropy-based random forest approach is 84 percent in predicting heart disease. This distinction can be made between patients with cardiac disease and healthy patients.",

        "abstract": "High power density and high-efficiency inverter is required for electric aircraft application due to the restriction of volume and weight. In this paper, a prototype of a 150 kVA inverter using wide bandgap SiC has been developed for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft application. The thermal properties of the SiC MOSFET have been analyzed and a corresponding air-cooled heatsink has been designed and tested. The gate driver circuit is carefully designed to minimize the stray inductance and the ringing of voltage is mitigated. The inverter system has been tested with 700V input and 70A phase current at a 20 kHz switching frequency. For the control of the 3-phase inverter, this design proposed an FPGA-based control board for high-resolution high-speed modulation index adjustment. A system power density of 47 kW/L is estimated to be achieved with a dimension of 110*155*185 mm.",

        "abstract": "SRAM-based computing-in-memory (SRAM-CIM) has been intensively studied and developed to improve the energy and area efficiency of AI devices. SRAM-CIMs have effectively implemented high integer (INT) precision multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations to improve the inference accuracy of various image classification tasks [1]–[3],[5],[6]. To realize more complex AI tasks, such as detection and segmentation, and to support on-chip training for better inference accuracy, floating-point MAC (FP-MAC) operations with high-energy efficiency are required. However, most SRAM-CIMs that previously used digital [5], [6] or analog [1]–[4] in-memory computing cannot effectively support FP-MACs: e.g., Brain Float16 (BF16) datatype. Since supporting high floating-point input (IN), weight (W) and output (OUT) precision for SRAM-CIM may cause (1) inconsistency between the shift-alignment of conventional digital FP-MACs and the structured mapping of most SRAM-CIMs, and (2) results in a more difficult tradeoff between throughput/memory size (T/S), energy efficiency (EF), and memory density (MD), as shown in Fig. 7.2.1.",

        "abstract": "up of coffee is a part of the daily human routine life. Any small changes in the coffee cherries yield that leads a huge change in coffee quality, smell, and taste. Types and stages of coffee cherries Identification and categorization of varieties and stages necessitate the presence of a farmer or crop pathologist. Manual illness diagnosis might result in mistaken identity and require a lengthy process. This work presents a comparison between the Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based approach and ResNet50 for classifying coffee type and maturity using transfer learning. Coffee cherries of different stages and varieties may be automatically sorted and recognized. Many ways to solve this problem have been proposed with transfer learning emerging as the dominant option due to its outstanding performance. This research work has implemented the Deep CNN Transfer Learning to detect distinct phases in the coffee cherries datasets. The suggested model employs VGG 16 for classifying coffee type and maturity got 96.38% accuracy and using ResNet50 for classifying coffee type and maturity with 99.01% accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that the suggested strategy is practical and that it would be used to detect efficiently and outperform other methodologies.",

        "abstract": "The article first investigated and characterized the high-frequency impedance of the wireless charging (WLC) coils. Formulas were then derived to quantify the high-frequency impedance characteristics of the WLC coils deployed in cellphones. Based on the analysis and derived formulas, a WLC and near-field communication (NFC) antenna integration technique was proposed, which utilizes the second inductive region of the WLC coil for NFC antenna operation. Both the WLC load effect and NFC IC load effect was considered, analyzed, and experimentally validated. Furthermore, two techniques to expand the bandwidth of the second inductive region were developed and verified by either simulations or experiments. All the derived formulas and analysis in the article were supported by simulations and experiments.",

The cascaded-magnetic-based electromagnetic energy harvesters, consisting of a clampable core and a high-permeability ungapped core, feature relatively higher density and predictability in energy harvesting. The clampable core only facilitates a non-intrusive mounting of the energy harvester onto the primary wire while the high-permeability core is the heart of the energy harvester to guarantee the maximum power extraction and usable output voltage. Therefore, reducing the clampable core size is critical to increase the power density without drastic power degradation. This article first presents the optimization conditions of the clampable core volume based on the harvested power level and other design requirements. FEM simulations using Ansys Maxwell and LTspice simulations are both executed to show the influence of the core parameters on the amount of harvested power and core saturation. This paper also presents an energy improvement method, controlling power transfer window via active switches, to improve the harvested power level. The boosted power is evaluated in this paper via experimental results.",

        "abstract": "In the modern era, everyone tries to be aware of their health, but because of their workload and hectic schedules, they only pay attention to it when certain symptoms appear. However, because CKD (Chronic Kidney disease) is a disease with no symptoms or, in some cases, no symptoms at all, it is difficult to predict, detect, and prevent such a disease, which could result in long-term health damage. However, machine learning (ML) offers hope in this situation because it excels at prediction and analysis. In this paper, we proposed nine ML approaches, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), Naïve Bayes, Extra tree classifiers, AdaBoost, Xgboost, and LightGBM. These predictive models are built using a dataset on chronic kidney disease with 14 attributes and 400 records to choose the best classifier for predicting chronic kidney illness. The dataset was gathered via Kaggle.com. Additionally, this study has compared how well these model's function. With the LightGBM model, we could predict kidney illness more accurately than ever before, with a 99.00% accuracy level.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the article is to develop a B2B two-wheeler vehicle that is only used for delivery and can save fuel costs. Byproducts from fossil fuel-powered cars include harmful greenhouse gases, which pollute the air and flood the environment. Consequently, choosing an electric vehicle has no emissions, leaves a reduced carbon footprint, and ultimately helps the environment. A further assurance that no CO2 is released during any stage of vehicle usage is provided by using renewable energy to charge EVs from sources like solar, etc. Given the rising price of gasoline, electric cars are both immediately and in the long run much more inexpensive than ICE cars. The average cost of operating a fuel-powered car is between Rs. 10 and Rs. 15 per km. For the same route, an electric car costs between Rs. 1.2 and Rs. 1.5, depending on the current cost of electricity.",

There have been many reported static and dynamic methods for classifying malware up to this point. The ML-MD strategy presented in this study uses static methods to categorise various malware families and is based on machine learning. In order to detect malware, we create a new machine learning-based framework. The characteristics from the dataset are extracted in this case using principal component analysis (PCA). In order to offer the best malware detection solutions, introduce a machine learning-based Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm. Improved Accuracy and detection rate using ML-based MPSO technique. The effectiveness of the suggested technique in detecting malware is demonstrated by the experimental results on several benchmark data sets, which greatly outperform alternative approaches.",

The services provided with IoT helps in easing the day-to-day activities. IoT has numerous advantages like scalability and ease of access but the drawback of the IoT system is that a centralized cloud is required for data storage and ensure the security and privacy of the users. In order to eliminate the drawback of IoT, recent studies have highlighted the integration of IoT systems with the distributed ledger technologies like Blockchain. The Blockchain technology would provide military grade security to the data. This article presents a comprehensive literature review for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain protocols.",

At low frequencies below 30 MHz, conducted emission and radiated emission are regulated by international standards such as CISPR 25. However, EMI tests usually require specified experiment setups, and it is time-consuming. It is desired for device manufacturers to develop prediction techniques that can simplify the prediction process and provide accurate prediction results based on analysis and simulation basis. This paper develops the LF EMI prediction models for conducted and radiated EMI. The prediction results are validated by experiments.",

        "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2's COVID-19 pandemic has quickly spread over the world, inflicting a sizable number of illnesses and fatalities. Stopping the virus's spread depends on correctly and rapidly identifying infected people. Although RT-PCR assays, for example, are thought to be the most accurate way to identify COVID-19, their cost and availability may be restricted in places with limited resources. In this study, we propose some deep-learning methods for predicting COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images. Chest X-ray imaging has become an essential diagnostic tool in the management of COVID-19, as it is non-invasive, widely available, and cost-effective. However, the interpretation of chest X-rays for COVID-19 detection can be challenging, as the radiographic features of COVID-19 pneumonia can be subtle and overlap with other respiratory diseases. In this study, the performance of different deep learning models, notably VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, and Resnet50, was examined for their ability to distinguish between coronavirus pneumonia and cases of pneumonia. 4649 chest X-ray images of patients with pneumonia (3526) and COVID-19 (1123) were employed in the study, and performance measures were used to assess each model. Confusion metrics were also used to evaluate each model's performance. The study's findings demonstrated that DenseNet121 performed better than the competing models, with an accuracy rate of 99.78%.",

        "abstract": "Over the last few years, the design and development of smart agriculture systems have been an important and emerging concept. Through various smart farming approaches, better crop yield can be achieved and output can be enhanced as well. Internet of things is an emerging concept that gives smart solutions for the implementation of various applications. Integration of IoT with WSN gives a cost-effective solution for increased productivity. IoT-enabled smart farming is a very efficient approach when compared with conventional techniques and methods IoT-WSN-based solutions are being used to monitor agricultural land with minimal human involvement. Many existing wireless protocols are already available, such as Wi-Fi, LoRa WAN, Wi-MAX, LR-WPAN, BLE (Bluetooth low energy), RFID, MQTT, Zigbee and Sigfox etc. This paper gives a review study of the comparison of existing wireless protocols and their effect on the IoT-WSN-enabled implementation of smart farming. It describes the primary components of the smart farming IoT-WSN model. It shows various features of different technologies implied in the IoT-based farming techniques. A rigorous analysis of existing wireless protocols used in IoT-WSN based smart farming has been presented and a detailed view of the role of relevant technologies and present protocols in smart farming is discussed in this paper. The Paper describes the representation of the basic energy consumption states for LoRa WAN, Zigbee, Sigfox, and NB-IoT end-device. This paper highlights the impact of energy-efficient LoRa WAN technology and the proposed WSN-IoT model for implementation.",

        "abstract": "The decrease in fossil fuel reserves has prompted a global move toward distributed energy resources. For this reason, solar PV power generation has recently gained much attention as a feasible renewable energy source. However, large-scale generation is challenging if there are anomalies in individual solar PV panels. This will reduce the efficiency of the PV system and create a potential fire hazard. In this perspective, the anomaly detection technique discloses system anomalies accurately and effectively. Identified anomalies will localize the event for an improved generation. This paper addresses the performance analysis of using the isolation forest technique to identify anomalies in the PV system and the rule-based fault localization technique to identify defective panel events. In the developed model, the isolation forest technique found around 453 anomalies in 45,740 observations, and approximately six panels indicated a fault in the system. The accuracy score is found to be approximately 0.9886. The proposed fault detection method will help detect the faults in solar power systems.",

        "abstract": "This study discusses about building a home automation operating system. Since innovative home systems offer various applications that simplify everything to operate, digital society immensely admires them. Today's wireless technologies and online ordering capabilities for home appliances make residents' lives simpler and more organized. Proposed System aims to assist the elderly and physically disabled by providing support and controlling household appliances. Relays are usedin the design to physically connect the home appliances to the embedded controller board's output ports. We demonstrate a system that uses a digital assistant like the MPU6050 to receive commands from people with impairments who use their hands more naturally, such as turning on or off everyday electrical items. To make the electrical household appliances hooked into a bright power strip or smart Arduino on or off, the digital assistant can connect to them. The disabled person only needs to move his hand to turn on or off an appliance by shifting the MPU6050 position.",

        "abstract": "Mainstream machine listening models are trained to learn audio concepts under the paradigm of one class label to many recordings focusing on one task. Learning under such restricted supervision limits the flexibility of models because they require labeled audio for training and can only predict the predefined categories. Instead, we propose to learn audio concepts from natural language supervision. We call our approach Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), which connects language and audio by using two encoders and a contrastive learning objective, bringing audio and text descriptions into a joint multimodal space. We trained CLAP with 128k audio and text pairs and evaluated it on 16 downstream tasks across 7 domains, such as classification of sound events, scenes, music, and speech. CLAP establishes state-of-the-art (SoTA) in Zero-Shot performance. Also, we evaluated CLAP’s audio encoder in a supervised learning setup and achieved SoTA in 5 tasks. The Zero-Shot capability removes the need of training with class labeled audio, enables flexible class prediction at inference time, and generalizes well in multiple downstream tasks.
