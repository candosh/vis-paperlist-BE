        "abstract": "Character segmentation forms the basis for optical character recognition. In this paper, we have proposed a character segmentation approach for printed Urdu script. Urdu is cursive by nature and its script is written from right to left. Both these factors make the segmentation more difficult and require special attention. Our approach is based on structural features and we have overcome different problems like over segmentation and under segmentation, present in previous approaches. We have achieved an accuracy rate of 99.4% which is better than others. The approach may be very useful for developing an optical character recognition system for Urdu language."

Lung tumours are particularly concerned by this problem because their positions are subject to breathing motion. To reduce the uncertainty on the position of pulmonary tumours during breathing cycle, we propose to develop a complete thoracic biomechanical model. This model will be monitored through the measurement of external parameters (thorax outer-surface motion, air flow...) and should predict in real-time the location of lung tumour. In this paper, we expose a biomechanical model of the lung environment, based on anatomical and physiological knowledge. The model includes the skin, the ribs, the pleura and the soft tissue between the skin and the ribcage. Motions and deformations are computed with the finite element method. The ribcage direct kinematics model, permits to compute the skin position from the ribs motion. Conversely, the inverse kinematics provides rib motion and consequently lung motion. It can be computed from the outer-surface motion.With regards to available clinical data the results are promising. In particular, the average error is lower than the resolution of the CT-scan images used as input data."

In this work we investigate how the property feature size can be used for the definition of 2D TFs and the visualization of medical image data. Furthermore, we compare this method to approaches that employ gradient magnitude as second property. From our experiments with several medical image data we conclude, that structure size enhanced 2D histograms are more intuitive. This is especially true in the clinical area, where physicians are much more familiar with the meaning of the size of anatomical structures than with the concept of gradient magnitude."

The use of automated compliance checking software has already been found to accessibly and visibly demonstrate that a much wider range of useful information than the purely pictorial can be measured, calculated, and derived from the model once constructed. This begins to expose students to those forms of information, beyond simple communication between designer and constructor, that are likely to be needed in analyzing and delivering sustainable design and performance throughout the operational lifecycle of the building to its eventual demolition and re-cycle."

Additionally, the study investigated whether the geometric model affects perception at varying degrees of linguistic complexity-specifically handshape complexity. We modeled and animated two polygonal 3D characters: Torrents, one seamless mesh, and Robby, a fully segmented avatar. Both characters had similar geometrical proportions, identical skeletal systems, similar visual styles and color schemes, and met standards of good character design. Each signed 60 stimulus signs, divided into three groups-those with simple (group I), moderately complex (group II), and complex (group III) handshapes according to factors established in the linguistic literature. 53 participants, who learned ASL by age 5, viewed animated clips in random order via web survey. They (1) identified the sign (if recognizable), and (2) rated its realism using a 5-point Likert scale. Findings show that the seamless avatar (Torrents) was rated highest, and simple handshapes were rated higher than moderately complex and complex ones. The interaction between character and handshape complexity was also significant. For Robby (more than for Torrents), ratings decreased as handshape complexity increased. The lower ratings for Robby could indicate a preference for seamless, deformable characters over segmented ones, especially in signs with complex handshapes."

The researcher traced the existing systems associated with the classification of Islamic geometric patterns i.e. 7-frieze patterns and 17-wallpaper patterns theories. Also researcher traced the conventional design methodologies that are based on principles of classical gridding systems, which are hierarchical in nature. The researcher found out to distinguish between classification of a pattern (collection of unit designs) and classification of a design (collection of geometry and grids). Classification of a pattern involves repeating the unit-design by isometry formulas (translation, mirroring, rotation and glide reflections) to generate a pattern that can be classified as 7-freize patterns or the 17-wallpaper patterns. Classification of a design involves the normalization of their geometries and grids. In this paper the researcher presented an argument those pattern theories are purely base models. A refined classification with specific focus on the girding system of the star/rosette of IGPs was required. The task of presenting a new method of classification rightly demanded a geometrically and scientifically validated method. Researcher has been successful in developing such a method and presenting it in user-friendly software. Researcher generated software that draws the geometries and grids of any particular star/rosette design and displays its classification instantly. This approach resulted in a measurable method of classification for any given Islamic geometric designs. The software is facilitated to identify the star/rosette sub-motif-grid from its griding system of classification which will allow the user to explore a verity of designs on the sub-motif-grid generating the sub-motif-design, motif-design, unit-design and finally the pattern-design in x-y direction."

So the construction management is essential to guarantee the correct progression of the construction activity. Moreover, trust is a central component in this type of activity to surmount the uncertainty. Therefore, we suggest making a connection between the coordination assistance tool and the notion of trust. This paper suggests representing trust in the correct progression of the activity in order to support the construction management and using this representation to guide user navigation in a multi-visualization environment. It will describe a methodology to identify trust information in a construction activity context, measure trust value and implement a trust-based prototype."

        "abstract": "Wavelet domain statistical models have been shown to be useful for certain applications, e.g. image compression, watermarking and Gaussian noise reduction. One of the main problems for wavelet-based compression is to overcome quantization error efficiently. Inspired by Weber-Fechners Law, we introduce a logarithmic model that approximates the nonlinearity of human perception and partially precompensates for the effect of the display device. A logarithmic transfer function is proposed in order to spread the coefficients distribution in the wavelet domain in compliance with the human perceptual attributes. The standard deviation sigma of the logarithmically scaled coefficients in a subband represents the average difference from the mean of the coefficients in that subband. The standard deviation is chosen as a measure of the visibility threshold within this subband. Computing the values of sigma's for all subbands results in a quantisation matrix for a chosen image. A major advantage of this model is to allow for observing the visibility threshold and automatically produce the quantisation matrix that is content dependant and scalable without further interaction from the user."

The visualization software tool presented here allows creating network diagrams with a programmable style of network components. This was realized by defining the scripting language OVL in order to give a fast and intuitive access to visual properties of nodes and edges. Additionally, networks can be displayed in different abstraction levels. So, data visualization becomes highly customizable to individual requirements and preferences."

        "abstract": "The arrangement of atoms at the surface of a solid accounts for many of its properties: Hardness, chemical activity, corrosion, etc. are dictated by the precise surface structure. Hence, finding it, has a broad range of technical and industrial applications. The ability to solve this problem opens the possibility of designing by computer materials with properties tailored to specific applications. Since the search space grows exponentially with the number of atoms, its solution cannot be achieved for arbitrarily large structures. Presently, a trial and error procedure is used: an expert proposes an structure as a candidate solution and tries a local optimization procedure on it. The solution relaxes to the local minimum in the attractor basin corresponding to the initial point, that might be the one corresponding to the global minimum or not. This procedure is very time consuming and, for reasonably sized surfaces, can take many iterations and much effort from the expert. Here we report on a visualization environment designed to steer this process in an attempt to solve bigger structures and reduce the time needed. The idea is to use an immersive environment to interact with the computation. It has immediate feedback to assess the quality of the proposed structure in order to let the expert explore the space of candidate solutions. The visualization environment is also able to communicate with the de facto local solver used for this problem. The user is then able to send trial structures to the local minimizer and track its progress as they approach the minimum. This allows for simultaneous testing of candidate structures. The system has also proved very useful as an educational tool for the field."

The second algorithm is to depict details by adjusting the shading levels according to the visual importance of an area by using 2D toon texture. Saliency was used in this paper as a measure to determine visual importance of each area. Adjustments of shading levels and local contrasts based on saliency create cartoon images that are properly revealing details of significant areas regardless of an objectpsilas surface orientation and the location of a light."

South East Asian face is considered in this study. All six universally accepted emotions and one neutral are considered for classifications. The method which is fastest in extracting lip features is adopted in this study. Observation of various emotions of the subject lead to an unique characteristic of lips and eye. GA is adopted to optimize irregular ellipse and regular ellipse characteristics of the lip and eye features in each emotion respectively. That is, the top portion of lip configuration is a part of one ellipse and the bottom of different ellipse. Two ellipse based fitness equations are proposed for the lip configuration and relevant parameters that define the emotion are listed. One ellipse based fitness function is proposed for eye. The GA method approach has achieved reasonably successful classification of emotion. While performing classification, optimized values can mess or overlap with other emotions range. In order to overcome the overlapping problem between the emotions and at the same time to improve the classification, a neural network (NN) approach is implemented. The GA-NN based process exhibits a range of 83% - 90% classification of the emotion from the optimized feature of top lip, bottom lip and eye."

        "abstract": "The use of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models to support construction project planning has been increasing in the previous year. 3D CAD models reveal more planning ideas by visually showing the construction site environment in different stages of the construction process. Using 3D CAD models together with scheduling software to prepare construction plan can identify errors in process sequence and spatial arrangement, which is vital to the success of a construction project. A number of 4D (3D plus time) CAD tools has been developed and utilized in different construction projects due to the awareness of their importance. Virtual prototyping extends the idea of 4D CAD by integrating more features for simulating real construction process. Virtual prototyping originates from the manufacturing industry where production of products such as cars and airplanes are virtually simulated in computer before they are built in the factory. Virtual prototyping integrates 3D CAD, simulation engine, analysis tools (like structural analysis and collision detection), and knowledgebase to streamline the whole product design and production process. In this paper, we present the application of a virtual prototyping software which has been used in a few construction projects in Hong Kong to support construction project planning. Specifically, the paper presents an implementation of virtual prototyping in a residential building project in Hong Kong. The applicability, difficulties and benefits of construction virtual prototyping are examined based on this project."

        "abstract": "Efficient techniques to compress/decompress triangulations are commonly used when dealing with huge size meshes. Optimal compression methods which allow to decompress just a part of a triangulation are nevertheless rather unpopular in practice. In this paper we present a simple technique which allows encoding plane triangulations without knowing a priori whether the whole mesh or just a part of it will have to be decompressed. In a pre-processing step the triangulation is encoded following a lossless approach. The compressed representation of the triangulation consists on a string of three types of symbols, and requires at most 5 bits per vertex. Provided the whole mesh has to be decoded, the method finishes here. If, on the contrary, just a query zone has to be extracted, the encoding sequence will be slightly modified, and a new sequence will be obtained from which just a query zone of the triangulation can be decompressed in optimal time. The method is suitable for those applications requiring to manage small parts of huge plane triangulations or to send via web the whole triangular mesh."

The resulting linear system is symmetric positive definite enabling the use of fast solution methods. The standard approximation to the Poisson equation on an octree grid results in a non-symmetric linear system which is more computationally challenging. To solve the advection of fluid we use the semi-Lagrangian characteristic tracing technique. To track the fluid surface we use Volume of Fluid (VOF) method."

The sheer sizes of polygonal models and the limited internet bandwidth put a threat to their visualization in a distributed environment. Streaming mesh, which consists of a simplified model and refinement patches, is used to overcome this problem. Simplification method and the data structures for refinement patches play crucial role in this approach. By employing distance measure and normal field deviation, we propose a new error measure to faithfully simplify polygonal models, and introduce more efficient data structures for refinement patches. We implement the streaming mesh using Java. Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods reveals that the proposed method results in better quality LODs in some cases, and the new data structures for refinement patches accelerate the refinement process."

This paper reviews approaches to using three edge detection algorithms for edge detection – and therefore extraction of the lesion from the surrounding skin.The three edge detection algorithms used are Sobel, Marr-Hildreth and Canny. Their performance is compared for 136images of both cancerous and non-cancerous lesions.Depending on the images, the best results are obtained either by Canny or by the Marr-Hildreth algorithm, however the edges produced by the latter are indistinct and the processing time is four times that of the other algorithms."

PBSO introduces physical constraints into conventional space-time optimization and then ensure the physical reality of the edited motion. The intermediate model is employed to solve the convergence of optimization process. The original motion is transformed into the simplified motion and then edited. Experiments shows the captured motion data can be correctly copied to a new character or new path with the approach."

Urban regeneration activities in built environment are complex and require a close collaboration between designers and planners in order to achieve a design plan that is environmentally robust and sustainable. Regeneration teamspsila inability to manually analyze complex maps for various regeneration choices induces human errors in the regeneration process. This often results in a prolonged impact on the economic, social and environmental wellbeing and sustainability of the region. This paper, presents the development of an urban regeneration fuzzy inference system (FIS) aimed at tackling the issue of regeneration simulation in built environment through the measurement of impact of certain socioeconomic parameters to the regeneration plan. The impact assessment logic is embedded in the form of an expertly guided rule-base of an FIS. The impact is calculated using the four core principles of urban smart growth (crime, accessibility, employment and health), with respect to a measure of Euclidean intra-regional distance based accessibility function between the regeneration area(s) and the surrounding built environment neighborhood. The FIS evaluates the suitability of various regeneration sub-areas in terms of the aforementioned four principles affecting the concept of a walk-able, sustainable and eco-friendly neighborhood."

The system developed is based on the concept of synesthesia: a dasialiaisonpsila between colour and sound, colour that becomes sound. This paper synthesizes a wider range of study regarding people with diverse psychological and movement conditions. It represents a new method of expression and of self development through music therapy and game, dedicated mainly to children aged between 5 and 13. Finally we conclude with a portable prototype device that has been validated and patented. It is capable of detecting colour and transforming it into sound: a colour sensor identifies colours and transforms this data into musical notes. The prototype is totally adaptable to the requirements of the end user meaning that the user can choose the best combination between colour and sound in order to improve their communication with the environment. We are now developing a mathematical theoretical background in order to formalize the correspondence between colour and musical space."

        "abstract": "Nowadays astronomers are experiencing an unprecedented growth in the quality and quantity of datasets coming from numerical simulations and real-world observations. For example, the increasing availability of high performance computing facilities has given the possibility to perform large-scale simulations of several dimensions. Also, forthcoming astronomical surveys are expected to collect datasets of several petabytes. The emerging need is thus for efficient visual discovery tools for rapid inspection to identify regions of interest in large-scale datasets prior to applying computationally expensive data analysis algorithms. This paper reports our experiences in developing visual discovery tools for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the most ambitious astronomical survey ever undertaken. We present existing tools and visualization requirements collected from SDSS users for new functionality. We then discuss a range of newly developed visual discovery tools and their applicability to SDSS and finally we conclude with pointers to future developments."

        "abstract": "Built Environment education entails the acquisition of complex technical knowledge by students. Currently, the conventional lecture format is the dominant educational method used, with the main principle being that of information transfer. As the required knowledge base increases, so the ability of the students to effectively absorb and use information is reduced. There is, therefore, an identifiable need to establish alternative modes of learning for students. To address this challenge, Strathclyde University has developed an approach to professional simulations called SIMPLE (SIMulated Professional Learning Environment). One aspect of the project focuses on developing an interactive digital, simulated learning environment to enable postgraduate Architecture students to learn some aspects of the Management, Practice and Law syllabus. This paper describes the design, pedagogical structure, implementation and evaluation of the SIMPLE simulation within this module. The results of the evaluation show that the teaching strategies of critical observation followed by critical imitation help students understand the transition from knowledge of first principles as presented in lectures to applied knowledge."

        "abstract": "Most existing visualization tools utilize only the visual channel to represent information. Several studies have demonstrated that sonification, the use of sound as an alternative or additional channel for data representation, can help increase the dimensionality of the visual representation and aid in the interpretation of information. We introduce a new sonification module for a visual data exploration system, the Super Spider. It extends a previously developed interactive visualization tool to support data exploration using sound. We also introduce a new data sonification technique and system, 2D Sonar. We have integrated it into Super Spider. Finally, we present user studies conducted to evaluate and validate the efficacy of visual and auditory mappings devised for these tools, and their results."
