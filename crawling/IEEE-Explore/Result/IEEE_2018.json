The metadata provided with each image enables reasoning about location, time, sun angles, physical sizes, and other features when making predictions about objects in the image. Our dataset consists of over 1 million images from over 200 countries. For each image, we provide at least one bounding box annotation containing one of 63 categories, including a \"false detection\" category. We present an analysis of the dataset along with baseline approaches that reason about metadata and temporal views. Our data, code, and pretrained models have been made publicly available.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we compare the radio propagation channels characteristics between 28 and 140 GHz bands based on the wideband (several GHz) and directional channel sounding in a shopping mall environment. The measurements and data processing are conducted in such a way to meet requirements for a fair comparison of large- and small-scale channel parameters between the two bands. Our results reveal that there is high spatial-temporal correlation between 28 and 140 GHz channels, similar numbers of strong multipath components, and only small variations in the large-scale parameters between the two bands. Furthermore, when including the weak paths there are higher total numbers of clusters and paths in 28 GHz as compared to those in 140 GHz bands. With these similarities, it would be very interesting to investigate the potentials of using 140 GHz band in the future mobile radio communications.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on giving a simplified molecular absorption loss model for a 275–400 GHz frequency band, which has significant potential for variety of future short and medium range communications. The band offers large theoretical data rates with reasonable path loss to theoretically allow even up to kilometer long link distances when sufficiently high gain antennas are used. The molecular absorption loss in the band requires a large number of parameters from spectroscopic databases, and, thus, the exact modeling of its propagation characteristics is demanding. In this paper, we provide a simple, yet accurate absorption model, which can be utilized to predict the absorption loss at the above frequency band. The model is valid at a regular atmospheric pressure, it depends on the distance, the relative humidity, and the frequency. The existing simplified model by ITU does not cover frequencies above 350 GHz and has more complexity than our proposed model. The molecular absorption loss increases exponentially with the distance, decreasing the utilizable bandwidth in the vicinity of the absorption lines. We provide a model to approximate the window widths at the above frequency band. This model depends on the distance, the relative humidity, the frequency, and the maximum tolerable loss. It is shown to be very accurate below one kilometer link distances.",

        "abstract": "Regression testing is crucial but can be extremely costly. Regression Test Selection (RTS) aims to reduce regression testing cost by only selecting and running the tests that may be affected by code changes. To date, various RTS techniques analyzing at different granularities (e.g., at the basic-block, method, and file levels) have been proposed. RTS techniques working on finer granularities may be more precise in selecting tests, while techniques working on coarser granularities may have lower overhead. According to a recent study, RTS at the file level (FRTS) can have less overall testing time compared with a finer grained technique at the method level, and represents state-of-the-art RTS. In this paper, we present the first hybrid RTS approach, HyRTS, that analyzes at multiple granularities to combine the strengths of traditional RTS techniques at different granularities. We implemented the basic HyRTS technique by combining the method and file granularity RTS. The experimental results on 2707 revisions of 32 projects, totalling over 124 Million LoC, demonstrate that HyRTS outperforms state-of-the-art FRTS significantly in terms of selected test ratio and the offline testing time. We also studied the impacts of each type of method-level changes, and further designed two new HyRTS variants based on the study results.

The expanded information promotes the development of a wide range of applications, such as cross-domain prediction, cross-domain recommendation, and advertisement. Due to the great significance of user account linkage, there are increasing research works on this study. With the widespread popularization of GPS-enabled mobile devices, linking user accounts with location data has become an important and promising research topic. Being different from most existing studies in this domain that only focus on the effectiveness, we propose novel approaches to improve both effectiveness and efficiency of user account linkage. In this paper, a kernel density estimation (KDE) based method has been proposed to improve the accuracy by alleviating the data sparsity problem in measuring users' similarities. To improve the efficiency, we develop a grid-based structure to organize location data to prune the search space. The extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with the state-of-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin-derived blockchain has shown promise as infrastructure for many decentralized models. However, problems are withholding the realization of the potentials. The booming increase of storage demand has hindered devices with storage shortage to use blockchain powered distributed applications. In this paper, we present section-blockchain, a new blockchain protocol, which is designed to solve the oversize storage problem without compromise the security of blockchain. There are no full nodes or lightweight nodes, all nodes are equal and contributing to the Section-Blockchain network. Experiments demonstrate that Section-Blockchain is efficient, remarkably reduced the storage, and withstand sudden nodes losing of massive scale. Section-blockchain also extended the capability of blockchain to the foundation of an autotrophic, tamper-resist decentralized storage system, in which, data can be equidistributional distributed worldwide automatically without any centralized dispatcher to assign storage; nodes are motivated to change their local storage to receive more remuneration. The global storage distribution is continuously optimizing and fit into any adding/losing nodes.",

In Coppelia, we develop a hardware-oriented backward symbolic execution engine with a new cycle stitching method and fast validation technique, along with several optimizations for exploit generation. We then add program stubs to complete the exploit. We evaluate Coppelia on three CPUs of different architectures. Coppelia is able to find and generate exploits for 29 of 31 known vulnerabilities in these CPUs, including 11 vulnerabilities that commercial and academic model checking tools can not find. All of the generated exploits are successfully replayable on an FPGA board. Moreover, Coppelia finds 4 new vulnerabilities along with exploits in these CPUs. We also use Coppelia to verify whether a security patch indeed fixed a vulnerability, and to refine a set of assertions.",

        "abstract": "Fork-based development has been widely used both in open source communities and in industry, because it gives developers flexibility to modify their own fork without affecting others. Unfortunately, this mechanism has downsides: When the number of forks becomes large, it is difficult for developers to get or maintain an overview of activities in the forks. Current tools provide little help. We introduce INFOX, an approach to automatically identify non-merged features in forks and to generate an overview of active forks in a project. The approach clusters cohesive code fragments using code and network-analysis techniques and uses information-retrieval techniques to label clusters with keywords. The clustering is effective, with 90% accuracy on a set of known features. In addition, a human-subject evaluation shows that INFOX can provide actionable insight for developers of forks.",

In the history, its development process is almost the same as machine translation, and the two complement each other. This article compares the natural language processing of statistical corpora with neural machine translation and concludes the natural language processing: Neural machine translation has the advantage of deep learning, which is very suitable for dealing with the high dimension, label-free and big data of natural language, therefore, its application is more general and reflects the power of big data and big data thinking.",

        "abstract": "Continuous integration (CI) development environments allow soft-ware engineers to frequently integrate and test their code. While CI environments provide advantages, they also utilize non-trivial amounts of time and resources. To address this issue, researchers have adapted techniques for test case prioritization (TCP) to CI environments. To date, however, the techniques considered have operated on test suites, and have not achieved substantial improvements. Moreover, they can be inappropriate to apply when system build costs are high. In this work we explore an alternative: prioritization of commits. We use a lightweight approach based on test suite failure and execution history that is highly efficient; our approach \"continuously\" prioritizes commits that are waiting for execution in response to the arrival of each new commit and the completion of each previously scheduled commit. We have evaluated our approach on three non-trivial CI data sets. Our results show that our approach can be more effective than prior techniques.",

        "abstract": "We use Grounded Theory to study the evolution of requirements practices of 16 software startups as they grow and introduce new products and services. These startups operate in a dynamic environment, with significant time and market pressure, and rarely have time for systematic requirements analysis. Our theory describes the evolution of practice along six dimensions that emerged as relevant to their requirements activities: requirements artefacts, knowledge management, requirements-related roles, planning, technical debt and product quality. Beyond the relationships among the dimensions, our theory also explains the turning points that drove the evolution along these dimensions. These changes are reactive, rather than planned, suggesting an overall pragmatic lightness, i.e., flexibility, in the startups' evolution towards engineering practices for requirements. Our theory organises knowledge about evolving requirements practice in maturing startups, and provides practical insights for startups' assessing their own evolution as they face challenges to their growth. Our research also suggests that a startup's evolution along the six dimensions is not fundamental to its success, but has significant effects on their product, their employees and the company.",

Three indoor scenarios have been characterized: a laboratory, a conference room and an office. Double steering of antennas at the transmitting side and at the receiving side has been performed in order to cover the entire angular range from -180° to 180°. The channel model results obtained from the measured data are provided through the path loss and delay spread and are compared with the ones obtained in lower mm-wave bands.",

However, it is a challenge to perform the sampling efficiently, while generating a diverse set of inputs which satisfy the constraints. We developed a new algorithm QuickSampler which requires a small number of solver calls to produce millions of samples which satisfy the constraints with high probability. We evaluate QuickSampler on large real-world benchmarks and show that it can produce unique valid solutions orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art sampling tools, with a distribution which is reasonably close to uniform in practice.",

WPE has been shown to be a highly effective tool for speech dereverberation, thus improving the perceptual quality of the signal and improving the recognition performance of downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR). It is suitable both for single-channel and multi-channel applications. The package consist of (1) a Numpy implementation which can easily be integrated into a custom Python toolchain, and (2) a TensorFlow implementation which allows integration into larger computational graphs and enables backpropagation through WPE to train more advanced front-ends. This package comprises of an iterative offline (batch) version, a block-online version, and a frame-online version which can be used in moderately low latency applications, e.g. digital speech assistants.",

        "abstract": "Increasing Internet use and facilitating access to online communities such as social media have led to the emergence of cybercrime. Cyber bullying, a new form of bullying that emerged recently with the development of social networks, means sending messages that include slanderous statements, or verbally bullying other people or persons in front of the rest of the online community. The characteristics of online social networks enable cyberbullies to access places and countries that were previously unattainable. In this study; the use of natural language processing techniques and machine learning methods namely, Bayesian logistic regression, random forest algorithm, multilayer sensor, J48 algorithm and support vector machines have been used to determine cyber bullying. To the best of our knowledge, the successes of these algorithms with different metrics within different experiments have been compared for the first time to the real data.",

However, these systems are required to ensure non-biased, efficient, transparent and secure environment. Blockchain, a technology based on distributed digital ledgers, can help facilitate the process of successfully effectuating these specifications. A detailed literature review has been conducted to identify the current status of usage of Information Technology in the domain of Human Resource Management and how Blockchain can help achieve a smart, cost-effective, efficient, transparent and secure factory management system. A Blockchain based Recruitment Management System (BcRMS) as well as Blockchain based Human Resource Management System (BcHRMS) algorithm have been proposed. From the analysis of the results obtained through the case study, it is evident that the proposed system holds definite advantages compared to the existing recruitment systems. Future research directions have also been identified and advocated.",

This results in problems such as unreadable text, cluttered navigation, and content over owing a device's viewport; all of which can lead to a frustrating and poor user experience. Existing techniques are limited in helping developers repair these mobile friendly problems. To address this limitation of prior work, we designed a novel automated approach for repairing mobile friendly problems in web pages. Our empirical evaluation showed that our approach was able to successfully resolve mobile friendly problems in 95% of the evaluation subjects. In a user study, participants preferred our repaired versions of the subjects and also considered the repaired pages to be more readable than the originals.",

        "abstract": "In Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), using multihop broadcast to achieve fast and reliable dissemination of event-driven emergency messages among vehicles has positive significance. Most existing solutions make relay selection by either senders or receivers. However, the former would fall into invalidation due to the unstable links, while the latter would generate extra delay. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism named MBM-EMD (i.e., multihop broadcast mechanism for emergency messages dissemination) to solve these problems. Our contributions are two-fold. i) We integrate multiple influencing factors such as vehicle density, relative movement, and channel quality into a new metric named ETGPH (i.e., the expected transmission gain per hop), and use it to select the optimal relays. ii) After acquiring the candidate set for further rebroadcast, the current sender firstly appoints an optimal relay from it to rebroadcast immediately. Other candidates will assist in forwarding according to our rules if this relay fails. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution.",

        "abstract": "Research shows that Facebook users differ extensively in their use of various privacy features, and that they generally find it difficult to translate their desired privacy preferences into concrete interface actions. Our work explores the use of User-Tailored Privacy (UTP) to adapt Facebook's privacy features to the user's personal preferences. We developed adaptive versions of 19 Facebook privacy features, and for each feature we test three adaptation methods (Automation, Highlight and Suggestion) that can be used to implement the adaptive behavior. In a \"think-aloud\" semistructured interview study (N=18), we show participants paper prototypes of our adaptive privacy features and ask participants to judge the presented adaptive capabilities and the three adaptation methods that implement them. Our findings provide insights into the viability of User-Tailored Privacy. Specifically, we find that the optimal adaptation method depends on the users' familiarity with the privacy feature and how they use them, and their judgment of the awkwardness and irreversibility of the implemented privacy functionality. We conclude with design recommendations for the implementation of User-Tailored Privacy on Facebook and other social network platforms.",

        "abstract": "Change impact analysis plays an important role in identifying potential affected areas that are caused by changes that are made in a software. Most of the existing change impact analysis techniques are based on architectural design and change history. However, source code-based change impact analysis studies are very few and they have shown higher precision in their results. In this study, a static method-granularity level change impact analysis, that uses program slicing and Bayesian Network technique has been proposed. The technique proposes a directed graph model that also represents the call dependencies between methods. In this study, an open source Java project with 8999 to 9445 lines of code and from 505 to 528 methods have been analyzed through 32 commits it went. Recall and f-measure metrics have been used for evaluation of the precision of the proposed method, where each software commit has been analyzed separately.",

We elaborate around design choices of various parts of the testbed, baseband hardware, required software and RF frontend. We also perform a thorough characterization of the testbed, in terms of I/Q imbalance, stability, frequency offset, DC offsets, and ADC/DAC clock rate offset. The study shows that the utilized design techniques for baseband and RF frontend hardware are feasible, and also that many hardware imperfections are possible to accurately characterize, for subsequent calibration and digital compensation.",

In C++, one place developers can find documentation is in a header file. When information is missing, they may look at the corresponding implementation code. To understand what's missing from C++ API documentation and the factors influencing whether it will be fixed, we conducted a mixed-methods study involving two experience sampling surveys with hundreds of developers at the moment they visited implementation code, interviews with 18 of those developers, and interviews with 8 API maintainers. In many cases, updating documentation may provide only limited value for developers, while requiring effort maintainers don't want to invest. We identify a set of questions maintainers and tool developers should consider when improving API-level documentation.",

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a special form of deep learning techniques, gain interest as a prediction technique in BPM. However, non-sequential control flows may make the prediction task more difficult, because RNNs were conceived for learning and predicting sequences of data. Based on an industrial dataset, we provide experimental results comparing different alternatives for considering non-sequential control flows. In particular, we consider cycles and parallelism for business process prediction with RNNs.",

The hardware demonstrator is a full-chain closed-loop communication system with a multi-beam DVB-S2X compliant gateway, a satellite payload, and MIMO channel emulator and a set of DVB-S2X user terminals with real-time CSI estimation and feedback. We experimentally show the feasibility of Precoding implementation in satellite communications based on the superframe structure DVB-S2X standard. Using the test-bed we have a possibility to run real-time precoded DVB-S2X communication and benchmark its performance under realistic environment. The hardware demonstrator is suitable to perform realistic benchmarks of Block- and Symbol-level Precoding techniques for multicast and unicast user scheduling scenarios.",

        "abstract": "A compact low loss waveguide phase shifter design based on gap waveguide technology is presented in this work. In the proposed structure, no extra length is introduced to the waveguide section which restrains the phase shifter compactness and makes it possible to develop equal length waveguide differential phase shifters which are so applicable in realizing compact beamforming networks. From fabrication point of view, the proposed structure is very compatible with groove gap waveguide (GGW) technology which makes it a low loss and efficient solution for phase shifting at millimeter wave frequencies. A sample 9ff equal length differential phase shifter based on the proposed idea is designed and simulated for 60GHz band. Results show proper impedance matching and low insertion loss (less than 0.3dB) as well as providing 90±5° phase shift over the frequency range of 58–62.4 GHz.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents the findings of the research performed with the use of a new universal ionosonde. Its multipurposeness is manifested in the sounding method used (oblique-incidence and vertical-incidence) as well as in the spread spectrum (SS) signals used (BPSK, FMCW and FMICW). The ionosonde was developed using SDR technology with transceiver platform USRP N210. The paper also discusses the features of signals of various shapes providing extra energy with a minimum transmission power and single antenna in the vertical-incidence sounding (VIS) mode. The algorithms for extracting a sounding signal from the background noise are presented. The algorithms of estimating current channel parameters were developed for determining channel state. They were used to estimate the availability of various separate channels. It was experimentally found that the diagnostics of the key parameters of a channel (delay and Doppler spread, SNR) allows to decrease the transmission power by 5 … 10 dB with a constant data transfer rate, or to increase the transfer rate up to twice with a constant transmission power.",

        "abstract": "Thousands of fatalities among pedestrians are caused every year by traffic accidents. Vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication promises to prevent accidents by enabling collision avoidance application. To develop and test a V2P communications system, accurate knowledge of the propagation channel is essential. However, only limited analysis of V2P channel have been reported in the literature. To fill this gap, the German Aerospace Center conducted an extensive channel sounding measurements campaign in a controlled environment. The measurements were performed at 5.2 GHz with a bandwidth of 120 MHz. In parallel to the channel sounding measurements, performance measurements were carried out using ITS-G5 system at 5.9 GHz and with a bandwidth of 10 MHz. This paper describes the setup and the scenarios for the two measurements. First results on channel evaluation in different scenarios as well as path loss models are presented.",

        "abstract": "Most propagation models do not consider the influence of antenna patterns on the parameters and characteristics of received signals. This assumption is equivalent to the use of isotropic or omnidirectional antennas in these models. Empirical measurement results indicate that the radiation pattern, gain and direction of directional antennas significantly influence on properties of the received signal. This fact shows that consideration the directional antennas in propagation models is very important especially in the context of emerging telecommunication technologies such as beamforming or massive MIMO. The purpose of this paper is to present the modeling method of power angular spectrum and direction of antenna patterns in a multipath propagation environment.",

        "abstract": "Improving the reliability of wind energy conversion systems is an important objective of research and of turbine construction. Especially oscillating loads at mechanical components induced through aerodynamics of the wind rotor cause additional expenses for maintenance. Real-time simulations of WECSs which include models of the wind rotor to simulate transients, facilitate the analysis of these oscillating loads and the development of advanced control algorithms for oscillation damping. Therefore, this paper presents a model of the wind rotor with adjustable accuracy and examines its influence on simulation results. Different wind effects that cause oscillating loads are analyzed using wind rotor models with varying accuracy. So limitations of model simplifications such as for real-time operation can be identified.",

        "abstract": "Multiband measurements, covering six frequency bands across the 0.8–73 GHz range, were performed in a typical residential environment in Durham, city, UK. Channel impulse responses were measured over distances ranging from 30 m to 200 m using the custom designed frequency agile chirp channel sounder of Durham University. The measurements were used to estimate the path loss parameters of the commonly used models which include the close-in model, the log-distance model and the multi-frequency model known as alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) model. The distance and frequency dependence parameters of the ABG model were estimated to be 3.1 and 2.1 respectively. The rms delay spread was also estimated and the median value was found to vary between 13.3–5.9 ns from 0.86 GHz to 73 GHz.",

This technology is based on spraying separately an aqueous solution containing silver metallic ions together with a REACH compliant, aqueous based reducing agent. This process allows to deposit chemical silver up to twenty two micron / hour at room temperature and at ambient pressure and is already used in industrial processes for metallizing plastics, composites and non-conductive materials in general and this in different formats (3 dimensional pieces, foils, …). In the second part, results obtained with 3D printed horn antenna, metallized with the above described process are compared with standard Cu horn antennas and 3D printed electroplated horn antennas at mm-wave frequencies.",

The array antenna consists of tightly-coupled bowties in a dual-offset configuration. In order to simplify the manufacturing process and eliminate the scalability limitation, a new feeding network is employed. The feeding is inspired by magneto-electric dipoles (MEDs) and planar ultra-wideband array antennas (PUMAs). Hence, the feeding is integrated with the horizontally oriented radiating bowties and removes the need for the external baluns. The simulated antenna shows relative bandwidths of 2 3 : 1 and 3:1 at VSWR<3, for maximum scanning angles of 60° and 45°, respectively, at both E- and H-planes.",

Gapless imaging of a swath of over 240 km at fine resolution, however, requires staggered SAR operation of the radar instrument, i.e., continuous variation of the pulse repetition interval (PRI). While NISAR presents a challenge in that the system's size is constrained by available resources, and it is planned to operate with lower pulse rate than would be optimum, interesting opportunities arise from subaperture processing and adaptive spectral estimation techniques that greatly improve the image quality at the cost of modestly more computationally intensive image processing.",

Sadly, that requires much more than just a fast graphic board and an immersive visual display. For multi-finger interaction, this requires some kind of wearable force-feedback device, a so-called 'haptic glove'. The recent growth of the Virtual Reality market resulted in an intensification of development efforts in this technology. These days many teams and start-ups around the world are announcing imminent releases of commercial haptic gloves. Indeed, in the last year there has been one new product announcement almost every month. It is clear that not all new ideas will actually make it to the market, and that not all haptic gloves are addressing the same range of applications. In this paper, the main technical constraints which are faced when designing a haptic glove are addressed with a special focus of the actuation technology. Then, a review of existing devices, past and present projects, comparing their characteristics and performance is provided. Lastly, insights on future developments are sketched.",

        "abstract": "A beam steerable Leaky-Wave antenna (LWA) is designed based on Partially Reflective Surface (PRS) and High Impedance Surface (HIS) materials for future millimetre-wave (mm-wave) mobile applications such as 5G. The antenna beam steering is obtained by changing the phase of reflection coefficient (S11) of the HIS through varying the separation between the HIS periodic array and ground layers. This is accomplished by employing direct current (DC) biased piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) on the ground layer. The antenna's simulated S11 bandwidth (BW), beam scanning range and maximum gain at 54.5GHz are about 3GHz, 43° in H-plane and 13.7dBi, respectively.",

Two main aspects are investigated. The first section is a thorough description of the coupling mechanism occurring in the reported array. The second section introduces a revised array topology that extends the scanning range. The proposed solution is based on the introduction of an additional coupling mechanism within the structure. Its goal is to compensate the harmful effect of the surface wave, and it is implemented by means of additional microstrip lines connecting the array sources.",

A cubic phase plate of dimensions 24.5×24.5 cm is designed to generate a non-diffracting Airy beam for a propagation distance of 40 m at 10 mm wavelength while achieving a maximum deviation of 33 cm. The cubic phase plate forms Airy beams from 5 GHz to more than 70 GHz resulting in, at least, 14:1 bandwidth for operation with corresponding beam deviation of 80 cm to 5 cm, respectively. Propagation of the non-diffracting Airy beam is simulated using the Fourier beam propagation method. Numerical results for plane wave and Gaussian beam excitations are presented and compared with the corresponding analytical solutions.",

        "abstract": "Especially in automotive and mobile applications, lean and compact tunable phase shifters are required. We propose a new varactor-based analog phase shifter in a broadband-matched bandpass configuration for a wide frequency range between 2–2.5 GHz. It enables continuous tuning of phase angles between 0° and 180°, which are steered by only one bias voltage. By cascading two implementations of the proposed circuit or in combination with a switchable wideband 0°/180° phase shifter all phase values between 0° and 360° can be obtained with low frequency dependence. The combination with a switchable phase shifter enables a higher usable bandwidth and offers the additional capability of selecting individual antennas in a multi-antenna system. After an analytic explanation of the phase shifter circuit, simulated and measured results of a hardware sample are presented and the influence of parasitic effects is discussed. A matching of better than 10 dB and attenuation of less than 2.5 dB is achieved for all phase constellations. Measurements of a phased array for satellite radio reception around 2.33 GHz using the new phase shifter clearly show the good performance of the circuit even with its small footprint and low component count. Continuous-valued beam steering in azimuth as well as discrete beam steering in elevation is achieved by the combination of a switchable with the new continuously tunable phase shifter.",

One example of such systems is modern cars with frequencies ranging from AM/FM to automotive anti-collision radars. The bandwidth limiting factor of traditional Spherical Near Field (SNF) systems is mainly the probe. Full probe compensation techniques have been introduced in recent publications, supporting the use of extreme bandwidth (more than a decade) antennas as probes with no loss in measurement accuracy. In this paper, the achievable measurement accuracy on the full 15:1 bandwidth of a traditional single probe SNF system using a standard commercial available wideband antenna as probe is reported for the first time.",

The concept is based on multilayered low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology and is suitable for millimeter-wave frequencies, above 100 GHz. The proposed packaging concept consists of a semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) connected to an antenna using half-wavelength wirebonds. The IC-antenna assembly is placed in an LTCC package cavity and partially encapsulated with a low-loss molding compound. A proof of concept operating in the 122 GHz ISM band has been demonstrated. It consists of an aperture-coupled stacked-patch antenna fed by a conductor-backed coplanar waveguide and interconnected to a dummy chip. The complete assembly is partially molded. Simulation and probe-based measurement results are shown at various steps, for a thorough analysis of the proof of concept.",

        "abstract": "Near field wireless power transfer (WPT) using transcutaneous inductive links has become one of the strong contenders for the powering of cardiac pacemaker, cardioverter defibrillators and neuroprosthetic devices. One scheme to achieve WPT is the use of a pair of printed spiral coils (PSC) acting as a transmitter and receiver. Optimization of the physical configuration of these PSC's is needed for maximum power transfer efficiency and tolerance to angular and lateral misalignment. This paper presents a new analytical model for the calculation of the self- and mutual inductances, AC resistance, and parasitic capacitance to design compact spiral PSC's for WPT applications. The proposed analytical model enables the rapid calculation of the power transfer efficiency (PTE) analysis of a spiral WPT system. A complete optimization model is also implemented in MATLAB. Furthermore, all analytical results have been validated using the 3D electromagnetic (EM) software ANSYS MAXWELL 3D combined with Agilent ADS circuit simulator.",

        "abstract": "A novel Barker coded excitation using pseudo chirp carrier (called Pchirp-Barker) is proposed for improving ultrasound imaging quality in terms of axial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this study, a pseudo chirp pulse with proper (<5.5) time-bandwidth (TB) product is considered as the carrier. Pulse compression filter is also developed that is formed by the pseudo chirp matched filter convoluted with the Barker code mismatched filter. In the simulation, the pulse compression filter is well performed to suppress sidelobes below -40 dB roughly. Simulation results show that in comparison with conventional Barker coded excitation using sinusoid carrier (called Sinusoid-Barker), the axial resolution of Pchirp-Barker coded excitation is doubly improved with the SNR loss of less than 1 dB. And the SNR can be improved by about 4 dB with the same axial resolution. Simulation of B-mode images with the Field II program is carried out to demonstrate that the axial resolution is improved from 0.7 mm to 0.4 mm. In addition, the Pchirp-Barker coded excitation has the advantages of binary-coded waveform and simple pulser.",

Automation of greenhouse benefits the farmers in various ways by detection of soil and water quality and automatic irrigation. Involving scientific process in this automation boosts the benefits on agricultural activities. The current status of the greenhouse can be collected and sent to the cloud infrastructure for further decision making. This paper deals with the design and implementation of a model for IoT based agricultural greenhouse system for better crop yield. The system uses light-weight MQTT protocol for device to device communication. This paper aims to leverage an IoT based agriculture system in a greenhouse and hence achieve the goal of reduced human intervention by automatically detecting and controlling various climatic factors such as soil moisture, air humidity and light intensity to automatically monitor the irrigation, aeration and lighting facilities of the greenhouse.",

This paper explains the principle of a method termed as “cross-channel sounding” along with its concepts. This method is used to evaluate the propagation duration differences of an unknown signal received by multiple synchronized distributed receivers. The mathematical description for cross-channel sounding is detailed, emphasizing the importance of the nature of the transmitted signal in the estimation of the propagation duration differences. An operational country wide TDoA receiver network capable of capturing HF signals is presented. HF broadcast signals are captured from different transmitters around Europe. Experimental data are used to analyze the different propagation modes from cross-channel sounding and assess the TDoA estimation complexity in the case of multipath channels.",

It uses the specific behavior of the electromagnetic wave's propagation in ferrite materials to create the nonreciprocity phenomenon and thus a natural circular polarization. Moreover, both the high permittivity and permeability of such a material imply that the antenna is miniaturized. In this framework, a magnetostatic and electromagnetic co-simulation of a circular polarized ferrite patch antenna working at 2 GHz is presented with reduced dimensions of λ0/8.5×λ0/8.5×λ0/37 at 2 GHz.",

Such a network can then be used to build a classifier with significantly fewer free parameters that generalizes well even when trained on a very small amount of labeled data. We train such a GAN on aligned Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image pairs. We then show that a pre-trained classifier using these features learned from transcoding outperforms classifiers that are trained from scratch when only a very limited amount of labeled pixels are available for training.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an approach to Big Data visualization, based on clustering techniques, in order to find a structure of them and to facilitate their visualization. However, the main problem of clustering is that sometimes converge to a local minimum showing only one solution, so an optimization of the K-means algorithm has been proposed with the aim to escape from local minimum and to visualize different solutions of the same problem. In particular, we use the K-means algorithm with multiple random starting points, in order to find several solutions to the same problem. This algorithm considers the data of the Italian calls for tenders, extracted through a crawling technique, and optimized through the proposed approach to obtain multiple solutions. These are used to achieve a repository of products that can be easily displayed and inquired during the formulation of an offer from a bidder company willing to participate to a call for tenders. The case study results show the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "In this work, two radiating elements were selected as a suitable candidates for use in the new generation of microwave imaging system developed at ELEDIA@CTU in Prague. These elements are the antenna based on the rectangular waveguide section and the bowtie slot antenna. Both elements meet the criteria we have established based on experience with the previous system: dominant radiation in the imaged domain, radiation symmetry and no need for a balun. The work deals with the verification of the fulfillment of the desired antenna properties and the mutual comparison of the two antenna elements by means of numerical simulations. Although both antenna elements exhibit the desired properties, the bowtie slot antenna exhibits lower internal losses compared to the rectangular waveguide-based antenna. This increases the magnitude of the transmission coefficients in our microwave imaging system by about 13 dB to about −74 dB (for the most distant antennas of the system) for the bowtie slot antenna (in comparison to the rectangular waveguide-based antenna). In addition, it can be expected that for this antenna element it will be easier to guarantee the reproducebility of the production and thus reduce the differences of the individual antenna elements in the antenna array of the microwave imaging system.",

The consequence of implementing the MTM-DS patch is significant reduction in mutual coupling between adjacent radiating patches by 60%, improvement in impedance match by 200% and substantial increase in the antenna's fractional bandwidth by 369%. Since the ground plane is unaltered the front-to-back ratio is unaffected too. The proposed technique is easily realizable and can be used effectively in beam scanning applications.",

Some examples are the location of products in a warehouse or the quick location of patients, medical personnel or equipment in a hospital. A location system is necessary for health care, home care, stock control or inventory. In this context, this paper presents the design and implementation of a low-cost centralized indoor location system that uses BLE technology (Bluetooth Low Energy) together with the particle filter algorithm. Experimental results show that the system can achieve an accuracy of 1.8 m, at best, with an accuracy of 74% within 3 m. The cost of the infrastructure goes hand in hand with the number of objects or people to be located.",

We propose the development of a cost-effective and affordable smart farming prototype that can detect plant diseases in advance and notify farmers so that remedial actions could be taken. Also, a web-based system has been developed to allow the farmers to monitor the status of their plants in the greenhouse. The development of such a smart farming plant disease detection system will allow farmers to have the ability to detect diseases at an early stage of the plants which will minimize yield loss from full-blown disease outbreak in their greenhouse. One important feature of this system is its ability to categorise the Septoria plant disease for which categorizing the stages of the disease outbreak on the leaf is very important. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that machine learning classification algorithm can be used in raspberry pi without losing performance. Based on our tests we also find that random forest classifier with colour histogram is the best combination to be run by this prototype for efficient plant disease detection.",

The backscattering mechanism at small incidence angles is quasi-specular and the backscattered signal is calculated in the Kirchhoff approximation. A two-scale model is used to describe the sea surface and in this case, the Doppler spectrum of the microwave radar signal reflected by the sea surface explicitly depends on the second statistical moments of the large-scale part of sea wave spectrum. It is shown that having measured the shift and bandwidth of Doppler spectrum of the reflected signal the model wind waves spectrum can be retrieved and statistical parameters of sea waves such as significant wave height and average period can be obtained. The field experiment was carried out using the Ka-band narrow beam antenna and retrieved sea waves parameters were compared to measurements of string wave gauge, which proved the validity of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission will carry L-band and S-band SAR instruments, each with a 240 km swath width. The L-band instrument has the capability to map the entire Earth's land and ice covered surfaces from both ascending and descending orbit positions, continuously in an exact 12 day repeating cycle, given temporally dense (better than 6-day on average) sampling of Earth over the life of the mission. To achieve this swath coverage without loss of resolution or polarimetric capability, NISAR uses a reflector-feed based antenna system with scan-on-receive (\"SweepSAR\") capability. One of the characteristics of SweepSAR is that the pulse repetition interval of the radar is shorter than the echo receive window for the 240 km swath. Therefore, transmit events occur during the receive window and the receivers must be blanked periodically, creating gaps in the coverage. For fixed pulse rate operations, these gaps are persistent strips of blanked ranges. NISAR is being designed to allow variation of the pulse rate in order to spread out these gaps throughout the synthetic aperture, but processing these variably-acquired data is more challenging and can lead to compromises in image quality. At the highest level NISAR places requirements on science measurements rather than image quality, so there is often a debate among science and engineering team members as to whether to operate with fixed pulse rates - leading to range strips consistently blank from cycle to cycle but with optimal image quality - or to vary the pulse rate, fill in the gaps, and live with degraded image quality. NISAR's performance team has shown that science requirements can be met with the gaps. However, scientists are eager for maximum and coverage within a swath. A companion paper (Villano et al.) describes image quality for NISAR using a variable PRF approach, but does not go further to science requirements. This paper explores the issues when gaps are present in the swath due to fixed PRF operations.",

The objective is to characterize propagation differences between the measured bands in view of correlated multi-band channel models. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of other vehicles blocking the V2V link by performing measurements with different blocker sizes (specifically, a passenger car and a large van). The shadowing effects and the correlation between intra-cluster delay spreads and large scale parameters are investigated in the different bands.",

        "abstract": "The most important logistics requirements are the reception of the product on time, in the right place and in the best condition. These requirements may be satisfied by implementing a smart logistic process. One important problem that is faced in that process is the bin packing problem. The bin packing is an NP-hard problem which focuses on optimizing the number of bins for a set of items with varying volumes and/or weights. Bin packing problem is used in many applications such as job scheduling, shipping items and placing data on multiple disks. Although many algorithms have been developed to solve the bin-packing problem, some drawbacks have remained unsolved like efficiency of the algorithm vs. optimal number of bins. In this research, we propose a multi-objective 3D bin packing algorithm that focuses on optimizing the number of bins as well as balancing the weight inside each bin. The proposed algorithm was implemented and tested with data gathered from FedEx. The computational results showed that the algorithm is efficient for a small number of problems and runs very fast for up to around 25000 items. The algorithm also balances the weights between the bins almost perfectly.",

        "abstract": "An innovative method of assessment of the nonzero phase shift between electric (E) and magnetic (H) field vectors is introduced, making possible an analysis of the impact on wave propagation of a 5G array antenna. The presented two-probe measurement technique is based on a robust assessment of spatial distribution of E and H fields along with a signal propagation orientation in the reactive near-field zone of a device. This method allows one to quantify both the energy radiating outward into free space and the reactive portion of the reversing electromagnetic field which affects the efficiency of the transmitter. The ability to examine the Poynting vector variation relative to the changing phase of 0, 30, and 90 degrees between two active elements of the array antenna provides information about beam strength and direction of propagation. This method elucidates the effect of the phase shift on wave propagation direction, back-scattering, and power density.",

This load profile is compared against a dated load profile of a standalone PV rural household with battery system (Load Profile 1.0) which is recorded in 2008. Both load profiles are tested in a similar standalone PV system with battery system, which is constructed in 2008, to present the adaptability of the dated standalone PV system to updated Load Profile 2.0. The detailed experimental result of both load profiles are presented. The results highlight that the standalone PV system with battery is able to supply energy to Load Profile 2.0 without failure while maintaining the battery SOC above 62%.",

        "abstract": "The testing of automotive antennas is usually performed in Spherical Near Field (SNF) ranges. Typically, the entire vehicle is measured to account for the antenna coupling with the structure. At higher frequencies, sampling becomes challenging, due to the electrical size of most vehicles. However, distant scattering can often be ignored with acceptable accuracy. If the antenna is well centred in the measurement coordinate system, the sampling can thus be reduced to represent only the immediate vicinity of the antenna. The Translated Spherical Wave Expansion (TSWE) allows the user to arbitrary move the coordinate system within the measurement sphere during post-processing. Thus, avoiding the physical movement of the vehicle for centring during test. In this paper, the Advanced-TSWE (A-TSWE) with reduced computational complexity is presented for the first time. The efficiency and accuracy of A-TSWE is demonstrated by comparative measurement on a scaled mock-up representing a realistic SNF automotive measurement scenario.",

However, existing imaging interval selection methods are usually based on traversal or iteration, which means that they are time-consuming and complex. Thus, to realize imaging interval selection simply and effectively, a modified imaging interval selection method based on joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA) is proposed in paper. Compared with the traditional range-Doppler algorithm (RDA), the proposed method just has one added step of JTFA. Real data processing results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Achieving reliably a high penetration rate of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems requires tighter collaboration between the transmission system operator (TSO) and distribution system operators (DSOs) to exploit in a coordinated way the flexibility options (e.g. demand response, RES, etc.) available in active distribution systems (ADSs). To this end, the paper explores the integration to TSO operations of the flexibility options provided by DSOs at the TSO-DSO interfaces, focusing specifically on short-term (real-time) active power balance satisfaction. The flexibility at a TSO-DSO interface is roughly modeled, after aggregation by the DSO, as active/reactive power box constraints inside which the DSO constraints are met. The paper develops a tailored AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem, supporting the TSO to cover active power deficit at least cost by the adjustment of conventional generators and flexibility options from ADSs, while integrating flexibility constraints at TSO-DSOs interface besides classical constraints. The interest and effectiveness of the proposed approach are illustrated using the Nordic32 system.",

This is designed using FR-4 (Lossy) substrate with 1.5 mm substrate thickness and the results of the simulations are validated using CST MWS 2011. The proposed design is achieved in 3 steps with each step resulting in a huge enhancement in the bandwidth. The proposed antenna works for all frequencies from 2.82-12.39 GHz resulting in a huge bandwidth of 9.57 GHz. Bandwidth enhancement of 56.62 percent is observed in the proposed antenna as compared to a simple patch antenna, presented in Step 1 of the following work. The proposed antenna provides this huge bandwidth with a nominal size of 15×20 mm2. The results are evident that the proposed antenna can be used for some part of the S Band (2-4 GHz), whole of C Band (4-8 GHz) and X Band (8-12 GHz) and will work for many applications including 802.11a Wi-Fi, Military and Government Institutions and Air Traffic Control.",

In this paper, a novel two-phase spectrum sharing protocol for two-way full-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, is proposed. Analytical expressions for the outage probabilities of primary and secondary users are derived and the theoretical results are approved via computer simulations. Obtained results are compared with the outage performances of two-phase full-duplex amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying and three-phase half-duplex DF relaying schemes. It is observed that the outage performance of primary user increases when the system residual loop interference is small enough.",

We validated this algorithm using 3D-printed MRI-based breast phantoms containing a malignant inclusion. Reconstructed images using our algorithm show the presence of high-scattering tissues with a contrast greater than 24 dB above the background clutter.",

The method is based on the measurement of the resonant frequency shift of the fundamental mode, described by the Gaussian beam theory. Instead of spherical mirrors, conventionally used for open resonators, the cavity is formed by parabolic reflectors, originally intended for satellite communications, reducing the production costs. A technique to improve the sample alignment is introduced, and to validate the results of the parabolic cavity, the relative permittivity and loss tangent of three different samples are measured.",

Although not specifically designed for this, on-wafer probes are also commonly used to characterize AoCs. The probe design provided a transition from coaxial cable to co-planar waveguide. As a test case, a monopole AoC is used to demonstrate several effects that influence an accurate calibration of the test set-up. It is shown that on-chip calibration is preferred and provides more accurate de-embedding of parasitic effects. In addition, it is shown that the polarization purity is seriously affected by the coupling between AoC and probe tip.",

A phase-only approach is first considered and the design is analyzed in terms of angular scanning performances. A pattern-based optimization is then described, taking into account both phase and amplitude effects on the outer lens contour. Comparisons between the procedures are finally provided leading to conclusions on the potential of the proposed beamformer concept.",

        "abstract": "In practice, a program may contain multiple bugs. The simultaneous presence of these bugs may deteriorate the effectiveness of existing fault-localization techniques to locate program bugs. While it is acceptable to use all failed and successful tests to identify suspicious code for programs with exactly one bug, it is not appropriate to use the same approach for programs with multiple bugs because the due-to relationship between failed tests and underlying bugs cannot be easily identified. One solution is to generate fault-focused clusters by grouping failed tests caused by the same bug into the same clusters. We propose MSeer - an advanced fault localization technique for locating multiple bugs in parallel. Our major contributions include the use of (1) a revised Kendall tau distance to measure the distance between two failed tests, (2) an innovative approach to simultaneously estimate the number of clusters and assign initial medoids to these clusters, and (3) an improved K-medoids clustering algorithm to better identify the due-to relationship between failed tests and their corresponding bugs. Case studies on 840 multiple-bug versions of seven programs suggest that MSeer performs better in terms of effectiveness and efficiency than two other techniques for locating multiple bugs in parallel.",

With their miniaturization capacity, high dexterity, and lack of rigid-links, their use in medical applications is increasingly considered. The specificity of their scale, their model differences, as well as the intended application requirements induced the developments of multiple control approaches. This paper provides an overview about control strategies of continuum robots and focuses particularly on those considered for medical applications. Furthermore, technical requirements such as sensor choices and actuation systems, as well as theoretical foundations including modeling approaches and autonomy levels are discussed in the scope of control of continuum robots. Finally, this paper elaborates on current challenges and open questions.",

        "abstract": "For universal input AC/DC applications, the hard switched flyback converter efficiency is relatively low and ranges between 75% and 85%. With quasi resonant switching method, the efficiency can be improved up to 90%. Although the efficiency improvement is significant, the total losses are large and they dominate the design of the converter due to the thermal considerations involving the reliability and the life of the power supply. Besides, it is hard to find a practical guide in order to estimate critical component power losses during design stage. For these reasons, a comprehensive power loss analysis is investigated for a quasi resonant flyback converter (QRFB) in this paper. For those purposes, a design procedure based on thermal considerations is presented, crucial loss items are illustrated on a basic schema and detailed calculations are done for 40 W universal power supply. Additionally, two methods are presented for transformer total loss measurement with a laboratory test setup. Evaluation of the results is also discussed at the end of the paper.",

        "abstract": "The development of 5G focus on the creation of a network with a much larger role than previous cellular generations: connecting new industries, enabling new services, and empowering new user experiences. 5G also introduces new higher frequencies in the mm-wave range, quite different from what was used for 3G and 4G. This has a significant impact on the design, developments, and testing of antennas embedded in 5G wireless devices. Fast and accurate antenna measurement systems are needed to satisfy the short developments and testing cycles to which today's antenna engineer are operating. Fast multi-probe systems is an established technology employed in fast and accurate measurement systems from 70MHz up to 18GHz. This paper describes a new multi-probe, near-field measurement system, in spherical geometry. The StarLab 50GHz is ideal for demanding antenna measurements for 5G applications in the 18 to 50GHz frequency range. Results from validation campaigns are also presented.",

The data acquired in staggered mode is not uniformly sampled and contain gaps within the synthetic aperture mainly due to the interruption of reception during transmission (i.e, due to blockage). Hence, proper reconstruction strategies must be considered in order to minimize artifacts. Conventionally, large oversampling rates are required to ensure low ambiguity levels, but this is not always feasible due to data-rate constraints. Based on an existing two-step (recovery/re-sample) methodology, this paper proposes an strategy for reconstructing low-oversampled staggered data which improves the reconstruction of point-like targets while ensuring the best performance for distributed scatterers.",

Exposure to electromagnetic radiation becomes a raising concern among the population worldwide, mostly due to the explosion of mobile technologies and services. A number of innovative and highly sustainable barriers made of circular section timber of low industrial processing, based on periodic structure of wooden poles that are stacked in a multi-layer configuration, while allowing visual transparency, is proposed. Immediate applications may be found in electromagnetic barriers that may be placed at intended radio exclusion zones in the [0.7, 2.5] GHz frequency range.",

        "abstract": "The problem of maximization of the power received by an array of compact antennas connected to a number of loads (such as rectifiers) through an optimal matching network is investigated, analytically, numerically and by means of a prototype. The matching network is optimized to match the antennas and load impedances. A decrease in conversion efficiency may be caused by the parasitic capacitance of the rectifier diode. To overcome this issue, we propose an improved detector topology. In this topology, a series inductor L is included in the conventional half bridge detector in order to compensate the effect of the rectifier parasitic capacitance. This LC resonance technique, significantly increases the available DC output power. Measured maximum values of the rectifier's RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of 30% and 50% have been obtained for input power levels ranging from −10 dBm and −2 dBm, at frequencies of approximately 1.84 GHz. The output DC voltage of the rectifier with two input signals of 0 dBm was measured to be 3.10 V at 1.84 GHz.",

In order to allow the classification of the type of harmonic loads, harmonic currents order produced by aggregate harmonic loads and the level of emission are modelled using the Multi-Layer Extreme Learning Machine with autoencoder (hereinafter denoted as ML-ELM-AE). The feasibility of ML-ELM-AE on the classification of the Harmonic empirical data set will be probed, for when the classification results of the Harmonic load types become available, it can come in handy to power system analyst or engineers for analysis in later stage. They can use it to determine the harmonic distortion patterns and to characterize the harmonic currents at network buses. Depending on whether the aggregate load is residential, commercial, or industrial, the load characteristics in terms of its harmonic contents are likely to be different. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of the investigated technique in dealing with the real world power system application of harmonic load type classification, that can be useful in providing good indication to the power system or distribution network planner.",

The basic idea of IDS is to use feature values from network packets capture mechanism to classify whether a behavior is abnormal. However, most traditional classification algorithms are incapable of recognizing unknown behaviors. To develop a high performance classification algorithm to improve the accuracy of IDS, the algorithm proposed in this paper will integrate clustering, classification, and metaheuristic algorithms as a classification algorithm for IDS, called search economics with k-means and support vector machine (SEKS). Moreover, this hybrid strategy for the proposed algorithm is aimed at improving the accuracy of abnormal behavior detection of such a system, reducing the computation time of a classification algorithm, and making it possible for the IDS to recognize the unknown and new variant attacks in a network environment. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms all the other classification algorithms compared in this paper in terms of the accuracy.",

In order to do it, a study of SLAM and EKF-SLAM implemented on similar systems was realized. A modular mechatronics system capable of being adapted to any standard wheelchair. This mechatronics module consists of a Raspberry Pi platform, which receives the data from the laser sensor to realize the autonomous navigation. The EKF-SLAM technique using only data coming only from the laser sensor, meaning that no additional sensors where used to do odometry. The system is capable of transporting people with reduced mobility due to their age or disability. The maximum user mass that the system can carry in order to work for an hour is 90 Kg.",

        "abstract": "Whether software architects should also code is an enduring question. In order to satisfy performance, security, reliability and other quality concerns, architects need to compare and carefully choose a combination of architectural patterns, styles or tactics. Then later in the development cycle, these architectural choices must be implemented completely and correctly so there will not be any drift from envisioned design. In this paper, we use data analytics-based techniques to study five large-scale software systems, examining the impact and the role of software architects who write code on software quality. Our quantitative study is augmented with a follow-up interview of architects. This paper provides empirical evidence for supporting the pragmatic opinions that architects should write code. Our analysis shows that implementing architectural tactics is more complex than delivering functionality, tactics are more error prone than software functionalities, and the architects tend to introduce fewer bugs into the implementation of architectural tactics compared to the developers.",

Our group has developed convenient methods to extract properties from antenna measurements of cm-scale tissues such as the forearm. We performed an initial feasibility study of hydration assessment with athletes, but found that our system suffered from variation due to arm repositioning. We have since improved it to allow for consistent antenna placement on the arm. This paper examines variation in repeated measurements using the modified system, which may allow us to more reliably detect changes due to dehydration.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the effect of asynchronous reception in multibeam satellite system forward link using our previously proposed cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique. Our proposed system is in a dense frequency reuse scheme and based on the cooperation of transmitting beams by targeting one user terminal at a time. The jointly reception of data streams features multiple access channel (MAC), where both data will be recovered by devising successive interference cancellation (SIC). Herein paper we show that in case of asynchronous reception, the propagation of errors through SIC causes huge loss of data frames and throughput degradation. Hence, we propose the channel model of the asynchronous NOMA, and we investigate the system's capacity region, where the information theoretic results show that the asynchronous reception of the data streams can indeed improve the sum-rate upper bounds.",

To solve the problems of complex arithmetic in the multiphase Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) control and low utilization ratio of dc bus voltage and low torque density in the multiphase Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) control, a multiphase carrier based PWM control method based on harmonics injection was analyzed. The proposed method improved the output voltage characteristic through injecting several harmonics signals to the standard sine fundamental signal. This paper, firstly, calculated the MMF distribution of a set of multiphase windings. Then, based on it, the magnetic field distribution of multiphase induction motor was discussed, and three kinds of multiphase carrier PWM technologies are compared. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the proposed multiphase carrier PWM method based on harmonics injection can enhance the dc bus voltage utilization ratio effectively, improve motor torque density and efficiency, while has the characteristics of low torque ripple and simple realization.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a 3D printed, inhomogeneous and quasi-isotropic gradient-index (GRIN) dielectric lens loaded double ridged horn has been introduced. The goal is to demonstrate that 3D printing technology allows easy and cheap fabrication of GRIN materials integrated into microwave components to shape their patterns. By loading GRIN dielectric lens inside the horn, the side-lobes are suppressed in both E- and H-planes. To demonstrate this concept, the GRIN lens loaded horn is tested on two conventional horn antennas, WRD350 and WRD750 respectively. Fabrication and measurement of 3D printed GRIN dielectric lens loaded horn confirm broadband operation, one step manufacturing, no need for post-processing, and the capability to reduce side-lobe levels. This is done without increasing the overall size of the system and the weight increase is insignificant.",

To this end, the output of the device is processed by means of an equalization filter, such that the superposition of the sound played back by the device and an acoustic sound component directly leaking into the ear canal approximates the transfer function to the open eardrum. A particular difficulty in designing the equalization filter is the occurrence of comb filtering effects due to a superposition of the direct sound and the delayed output of the device. Here, we propose a regularized least-squares design approach with a closed-form solution that takes into account individually measured transfer functions of the device and ear, as well as the processing delay. Experimental results utilizing measured transfer functions from a custom prototype device show good equalization performance, particularly a reduction of comb-filtering effects as a result of an automated frequency-dependent regularization.",

Using the asymptotic correspondence for two- and three-dimensional problems of the antenna theory leads to simpler mathematical models for vertical dipole arrays. Numerical study of the mathematical models is based on iterative regularization of the ill-posed problem of reconstructing current distribution. It is proved that the suggested reconstruction method provides for the high accuracy and stability of the mathematical models of measuring systems even when random errors in measuring data are sufficient.",

The proposed algorithm adds an update mechanism in the traditional energy detection process and maps the current channel state statistic by using the channel statistics of the previous detections. This algorithm is studied in the satellite cognitive network scenario, in which GEO satellite network is primary user, LEO satellite network is secondary user. Moreover, a spectrum sensing model is built to help study this algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of spectrum sensing and solves the problem that the power of the signal to be detected is constantly changing due to shadow effect.",

The aim of the measurement campaign is to study the coverage in a Device-to-Device (D2D) communication scenario. The measurement campaign was conducted in the LTE band 8 at 917.5 MHz with measurement ranges extending to more than 2.5 km. The measurements have been conducted using a purpose-developed measurement system with a dynamic range of 180 dB. The measurements showed that a D2D system with transmit and receive antenna at heights of 1.5 m could achieve a range of approximately 2 km using the 164 dB path-loss limit specified for Narrow Band Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT).",

To analyze such opinionated reviews, the proposed system presents a linguistic approach to opinion mining. This system analyzes hotel user reviews written in Myanmar language and performs the opinion mining tasks at the aspect level. Finally, the system classifies the aspects/features contained in the reviews as positive, negative or neutral. The important task of aspect level opinion mining is identifying the relations between aspects and opinion words in the reviews. This detection is a big challenge because of informal writing styles of reviews. Especially, it is a difficult task of aspect level opinion mining on Myanmar reviews due to the nature of Myanmar language. Therefore, the proposed system mainly focuses on extracting the relevant pairs of aspects and opinion words from the user reviews using the syntactic patterns and some linguistic rules.",

        "abstract": "According to the EU Water Framework Directive every country is obliged to monitor the groundwater level, which is essential for the country's water management. Among others, the groundwater is a very important source of drinking water and a significant element of the agricultural economy. Water budget (balance), a basic quantity of hydrology, is used to assess the amount of water in the ground needed for consumption. This is the reason why the water budget must also be calculated, even if the basic purpose is the groundwater level determination from GRACE data. Water budget computations are based on evapotranspiration and land surface hydrosphere state. The quantities required to calculate it can be obtained from land data assimilation systems, like American GLDAS (Global Land Assimilation System). In this paper, all the components of the water budget, like precipitation, surface run-off and evapotranspiration, are studied over the area of Poland. The resultant water budget is determined, interpreted and presented graphically.",

Indeed, to take full advantage of the optimized sampling grid and to reduce the measurement time, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control system with an appropriate compensation signal has been developed to drive the Near-Field scanner and to follow a general trajectory traversing the samples arranged on a raster grid. The performance of the control system is experimentally assessed by a comparison with a standard approach.",

We present results from a project investigating the possibility and quality of short term prediction of satellite link attenuation at Ka-band. The starting point is a 67 h near time numerical weather prediction data from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. A period of 3 months and for 3 sites in Norway have been studied. Based upon these accumulated 9 months of data, the precipitation along the satellite link to the ground terminal is calculated for every hour. The attenuation results from the model is compared to high accuracy contemporary measurements of the same path. If the forecast is predicting the presence of precipitation correctly, the predicted attenuation error has a low bias and the standard deviation value is typically in the order of 1.5 dB.",

The first one is based on numerical weather predictions and in particular the ECMWF forecasts that uses high resolution deterministic forecast and the probabilistic forecasts the perturbated products. The second methodology is based machine learning algorithms, which are advanced statistical methods. The two algorithms tested in this study are the random forest and the gradient boosting, both based on regression trees. Finally, the last method that is employed is the recurrent neural networks and in particular the Long Short Term Memory. These neural networks are used for the prediction of time series using memory blocks. All the algorithms are tested using data from the ALPHASAT experiment at Chilbolton and Chilton, UK. The obtained results are very encouraging.",

However, current design methodologies are focused on the maximization of pattern-related performance metrics in order to indirectly provide solutions with optimal capacity performance. This work is aimed at showing that there is not a direct or indirect relation between pattern performance and capacity performance, since the latter strongly depends on the surrounding scenario. As a consequence, new design methodologies should take into consideration the propagation scenario instead of pattern performance metrics in the design process. In order to provide a preliminarily proof of this concept an illustrative numerical example is shown.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a compact reconfigurable semi-bowtie antenna design operating at 868MHz, 915 MHz, 1.8 GHz and 2.1 GHz is presented. Reconfiguration of the design is achieved by resorting to a digitally tunable capacitor (DTC). The capacitance change of the DTC occurs based on 5 bits sequence commands through a microcontroller. Changing the command sequences leads to frequency reconfiguration. The antenna is waveguide coplanar fed with a gain that varies from 0.2 dB to 2.7 dB in function of the frequency of operation and the reconfiguration state. The presented antenna is proposed for implementation for internet of things (IoT) devices.",

It is demonstrated how the knowledge about the elements of construction and operation phases and their relationships, combined with monitoring data can be used for more effective management of the risks associated with civil engineering projects. The methodology chosen for estimating the probabilities of risk events is known as Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs). To better illustrate how the proposed approach works the authors use the example of multi-family residential building located in Gdansk made in the wood-frame technology.",

While state-of-the-art ASR software is freely available, the language dependent acoustic models are lacking for languages other than English, due to the limited amount of freely available training data. We train acoustic models for German with Kaldi on two datasets, which are both distributed under a Creative Commons license. The resulting model is freely redistributable, lowering the cost of entry for German ASR. The models are trained on a total of 412 hours of German read speech data and we achieve a relative word error reduction of 26% by adding data from the Spoken Wikipedia Corpus to the previously best freely available German acoustic model recipe and dataset. Our best model achieves a word error rate of 14.38 on the Tuda-De test set. Due to the large amount of speakers and the diversity of topics included in the training data, our model is robust against speaker variation and topic shift.",

To deal with uncertainty issues caused by uncertain renewable power generation and loads, this paper proposes a two-stage robust operation approach for islanded MEMGs which coordinates diesel generators, combined heat and power plants with auxiliary boilers and thermal energy storage units in two operation stages, i.e. daily and hourly operation. The first-stage daily operation is optimized with the consideration of the second-stage hourly operation and the second-stage hourly operation is to compensate the first-stage operation, aiming to supply reliable and sufficient electric and thermal energy to customers in islanded MEMGs. This paper applies a robust optimization method, where the uncertainties are fully taken into account, to solve the proposed two-stage operation problem. The proposed two-stage robust operation approach is tested through Monte Carlo feasibility checks. The results show high operating robustness of the proposed approach for islanded MEMGs.",

To increase the channel capacity, we consider exploiting the polarisation information and send two different signals simultaneously at the same direction, same frequency, but with different polarisations. These two signals can also be considered as one composite signal using the four dimensional (4-D) modulation scheme across the two polarisation diversity channels. In this paper, based on cross-dipole arrays, we formulate the design to find a set of common weight coefficients to achieve directional modulation for such a composite signal and examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an uncalibrated image based visual servo (IBVS) scheme for automatic device. After establishing the differential drive motion model and odometry model, a visual line follower control algorithm is designed to give the appropriate pulse width modulation (PWM) control signal for differential drive of automatic vehicle based on imagine extraction, canny edge detector, center calculation and Kaiman filter update. That can make the automatic vehicle move with the requested linear and angular velocities. With the image segmentation, the background captured from the front camera can be suppressed and the line center can be accurately detected. In order to decrease the noise, a discrete Kaiman filter is used for tracking the line center. An error based on the difference between the image center and the line center is generated and used for steering the automatic devices follow the line. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can realize the path tracking based on imagine.",

This gain curve gives it advantage over a corresponding regular q-ZSC because under a given duty ratio, it has a gain greater by magnitude 1. When operated at a duty ratio of 0.677, it has a gain of −2.1 compared to −1.1 for the regular q-ZSC, signifying an increased gain of 90.9%. The equation relating the gains of the two converters was also derived. Its additional capacitor and inductor belong to its impedance network thus permitting higher frequency operation, elimination of dead time, shoot-through effects etc. gives it advantage over a corresponding traditional buck-boost converter. Its operation and a corresponding buck-boost converter are compared and analyzed.",

        "abstract": "Due to the inherent defects in the pneumatic and hydraulic systems, the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) has become a trend in the future development of the aircraft. With the rapid increase of the power of airborne equipment and the limit of weight and volume, the traditional silicon based power devices cannot meet the needs of MEA. Gallium nitride (GaN) power devices have become one of the most promising devices for aviation inverter power due to their advantages of high efficiency, high frequency and high power density. However, when GaN device works in high frequency, the dv/dt and di/dt slopes increased due to stray inductances and parasitic capacitances, which lead to oscillations and overshoots in gate-source voltage and affect the stability of driving circuits. Especially in aviation inverter, crosstalk between GaN power device in bridge circuits severely limits the performance of the inverter and poses a challenge to the safety of aircraft power systems. In order to solve the short-circuit of bridge arms caused by crosstalk in the aircraft power supply system, an improved design of gate driving circuit was proposed, which can eliminate the parasitic oscillation and voltage spikes, suppress crosstalk and higher order harmonics effectively. In addition, a double pulse test prototype is built and the simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of this drive circuit. Therefore, applying this driving circuit to the aircraft DC-DC can effectively improve the reliability and robustness of the aviation GaN inverter.",

        "abstract": "Cities are transforming to smart as various devices, technologies, services, connections, blocks, and storages are all readjusting to smart in contrast to the traditional ones. All such interconnected devices are said to be the Internet of Things (IoT) which grants the users a convenient life. At the same time, it leaves behind challenges to handle as these devices are loosely linked and the information is transmitted through the network. In this study, a review of various components forming a smart city with the challenges and factors influencing them are considered. A general objective of the study is to identify the different areas of smart city which are affected by cyber security challenges and find out the rank of each area. The data for this research is obtained from the questionnaire, experts' views and paired comparisons of the prior studies and by using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process approach, find the weight of each factor and sub factor and their rank accordingly. Amongst the nine-factors, the \"Smart Security' factor with the weight of 0.198 is the most important, and the \"Smart Building\" factor with the weight of 0.058 is the least significant area influenced by cyber security challenges is smart cities.",

The proposed technique is based on the identification of the dominant hotspots of the target from an Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) image generated over an azimuthal angle of 360°. This ISAR image is the result of the superposition of multiple ISAR images obtained by electromagnetic simulations based on a GO-PO method of the metallic target (without radar absorbing materials). The lowered RCS of the target covered with radar absorbing materials is estimated by a proper attenuation of the hotspots treated with radar absorbing materials in the single ISAR images. The proposed method is applied to some test cases, i.e. a rocket and a ship analysed at the central frequency of 20 GHz.",

        "abstract": "The large ceiling fan is often attribute to the weather which is environmentally warm and humid conditions. Usually, IM has low starting torque compared to other DC motor. But IM need to be attached with the gear mounted on the ceiling to reduce the speed. This contributes to the main problem of this application which is noise and vibration due to gear. In this research, the aim is to design a BLDC motor with of Double Stator Slotted Rotor Brushless DC Motor (DSSR-BLDC) topology to overcome the problem occurs in large ceiling fan application. Initially, DSSR-BLDC is designed using Permeance Analysis Method (PAM) to determine the motor sizing. By using PAM, the magnetic flux is calculated using magnetic circuit and mathematical modelling based on the direction of flux which flows in stator, rotor and air gaps. Secondly, the DSSR-BLDC model is analyze using Finite Element Method (FEM) to predict the back emf (BEMF), static torque and the transient torque. The result shows the DSSR-BLDC is able to produce 45 Nm of torques and fulfill the design restrictions. Finally, this research provides an overview of designing DSSR-BLDC for large ceiling fan application.",

Outputs of SAR systems are need to be improved via advanced post-processing techniques for applications such as moving target (e.g. vehicle, pedestrian) and threat activity detection on ground. Firstly, advanced clutter suppression techniques to improve GMTI detection performance are studied. Secondly, ground-placed wire detection is observed both with airborne and ground-based SAR systems. Lastly, threat activity detection on terrain with airborne SAR is presented. The data used within this paper are acquired with SARPER (exp TM) Airborne SAR System and experimental ground-based SAR system, both developed by ASELSAN.",

The antenna consists of three sections: transition from rectangular waveguide WR-15 to the groove gap waveguide, 3rd order coupled resonator band pass filter and horn antenna. The antenna pattern is end-fire. For the reduction of the back-lobe radiation, a corrugated wall as soft surface is designed on the exterior surface of the horn antenna. The computer simulation is obtained by two commercial softwares of CST and HFSS for the validation of filtenna performance. In the frequency band of 61 to 64 GHz, the gain and radiation efficiency are 9.2 to 13 dBi and 90%, respectively.",

Communication among nanodevices will be wireless and works at Terahertz (THz) band frequencies (0.1–10 THz). In this paper, the performance of wireless network communication for intrabody communication in the presence of noise and interference is evaluated, taking into account a peculiarity of THz propagation due to molecular absorption and molecular noise inside human tissue. Furthermore, link budget analysis will be included to determine transmission range based on Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) requirement for TS-OOK modulation. The performance of single-user and multi-user communication inside human tissue has been done using simulation in three dimensions scenario. The results show the effective communication range for single-user models is limited to 1–2 mm. Moreover, the high node density and random pulse transmission among nano-network decrease the system performance.",

In this contribution, we propose a modified version of the CSI scheme in which a new set of complex unknowns modulating the amplitude of the primary sources is considered. The usefulness of the modified CSI is demonstrated by exploiting the inverse scattering problem for the synthesis of a dielectric lens antenna fulfilling given pattern constraints. Moreover, the approach can be conveniently extended to the synthesis of Photonic Crystals-based devices.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an effective approach is developed to diagnose sensor faults of fuel metering unit (FMU) control system. The accurate mathematical model of FMU is built and features of sensor fault are analyzed. To improve the accuracy of sensor diagnosis, Kaiman filters are utilized to estimate the optimal outputs of dual-redundancy sensors both in the presence of process noise and measurement noise. However, the diagnosis results depend on the accuracy of system model, especially in the dynamic process. Therefore, an improved residual checking method based on a real time moving detection window is proposed to reduce the false alarm rate. In addition, the design criteria of window width and threshold value are given according to the requirements of control system. The proposed method is verified via simulation. Results show that when faults occur in a sensor, they can be accurately detected in time. Moreover, the method effectively avoids false alarm during the rising stage when the operating point changes.",

There is lots of functionality to explore: The eBay home page, for instance, sports more than 2,000 individual GUI elements that a crawler has to trigger in order to discover the core functionality. We show how to leverage tests of other applications to guide test generation for a new application: Given a test for payments on Amazon, for instance, we can guide test generation on eBay towards payment functionality, exploiting the semantic similarity between UI elements across both applications. Evaluated on three domains, our approach allows to discover \"deep\" functionality in a few steps, which otherwise would require thousands to millions of crawling interactions.",

Two different methodologies can be identified in the current research on AMCs for Antenna-on-Chip; the AMC is either fully constructed in the metal stack, or the lossy silicon substrate is included in the AMC design. In this paper, an equation is derived to calculate the fractional bandwidth (BW) of these two different methodologies. It is shown that for the upper region in the mm-wave spectrum, the acquired fractional BW, when constructing the AMC fully in the metal stack, seems promising. However, in the lower region of the mm-wave spectrum, the acquired fractional BW is rather poor and the lossy silicon substrate has to be included. The trade-off between acquired fractional BW and induced losses in the lossy silicon substrate is visualized as well.",

        "abstract": "Conductor position with respect to wind flow within bundle overhead line (OHL) system plays important role to determine its thermal state. At present, thermal state of bundled conductors are characterized by the heat transfer performance of single configured conductor or the upstream conductor which is fundamentally suitable for “low” temperature operation. However, for High-Temperature Low-Sag (HTLS) conductors that can operate at “high” temperature, this simplified characterization may not be sufficient due to high dissipated heat released from the upstream conductor to the nearby conductors located at the downstream position. COMSOL is used to further evaluate and provide initial insight on the thermal state of each conductors within bundle system. The results indicate that the use of simplified current-temperature relationship for bundled conductor (Joree, 47.75 mm) could overload the downstream conductor up to 4.5°C (2.25%) when is rated at I200°C. This signifies the needs to further evaluate the existing current-temperature calculation method for bundled HTLS conductors.",

A ray-tracing tool is used to characterize the indoor multi-path channel environment. Subsequently, a baseband analysis is done to evaluate the performance of the full-duplex system. Two antenna selection algorithms are tested: an optimal exhaustive method, and a practical low-complexity approach for real-case scenarios. It is shown that the high complexity, and the additional hardware, required for the optimal antenna-selection may be avoided without big drop in the performance of the full-duplex system.",

        "abstract": "Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) measurements on a transformer is an effective method to detect deformation of the windings. Various publications have attempted to use this method in different ways to detect or localize the deformation. Some of them have tried to obtain a detailed model of the winding using the FRA measurement to assess the deformation. On the other hand, the detailed model could also be used for finding the sectional winding transfer functions (SWTFs), which were needed for electrical PD localization methods. Although for both applications the detailed model of windings is necessary, the influence of different parameters of the detailed model on FRA measurements could be different and their importance are not same. There are various connections for FRA measurements, which are more sensitive to some specific parameters. Hence, a comprehensive study on the sensitivity of different parameters of the transformer detailed model is conducted in this contribution.",

        "abstract": "Constant current (CC) / Constant voltage (CV) is the most optimum algorithm applied for lithium-ion battery charging used in EVs. However, major issue during this mode of charging are the switching transients. Subsequently, smooth transition from CC to CV is required for minimizing switching losses and increasing the battery life expectancy. Generally, toggle switch is used to transit from CC to CV. It operates (CC to CV), when the output voltage reaches to predefined value of voltage. But due to the ripple in the output voltage, toggle switch changes its state from ON to OFF and OFF to ON. Hence, the output of the controller oscillate between CC to CV continuously. To mitigate this problem, a novel charging method, using Schmitt trigger, for optimum transition from CC to CV is proposed in this paper. Schmitt trigger operates in a specified band limit, which is decided by the voltage ripple. To verify this scheme, boost converter is modeled and its controllers for CC and CV mode are designed. Proposed scheme is implemented in MATLAB using real time simulator Opal-RT.",

This paper introduces an efficient scheme to countermeasure rain fading by using rateless codes. The proposed scheme utilizes existing AMC scheme with the LDPC codes, and thus it can be easily combined with existing standards. The error rate and spectral efficiency performance simulation results demonstrate performance enhancement over a satellite rain fading channel, with almost the same code rate as the existing LDPC codes.",

Compared to a full-drive dexterous robot hand, the underactuated gripper has a more compact structure, simpler control, and good self-adaptive ability, it can be applied to different shapes of objects. However, in some cases, improper design will lead to uneven grasping force, and it will not be able to grasp firmly or even have ejection phenomenon. So the optimization of the geometrical parameters is of great importance. In this paper, according to the designed three-degrees-of-freedom link-type underactuated manipulator, the mechanical model under grasping state is deduced by the principle of virtual work. Setting the average degree of grasping force as the optimization goal, the size and angle of pressure have been optimized by using MATLAB genetic algorithm toolbox and several suitable results have been obtained.",

        "abstract": "The increasing share of renewable energy integrated into the electricity networks, particular solar photovoltaic systems has introduced new operational challenges to grid operators. As the solar output is highly intermittent, the occurrence of power mismatch in the system will increase. Furthermore, the converter-based solar photovoltaic (PV) plant has zero inertia which will inevitably reduce the overall system's inertia and cause stability problem in the event of contingency or large power mismatch. In this regard, this paper aims to investigate the impacts of large-scale solar PV plant on power system's frequency response. Two IEEE test systems have been considered in this study, namely the IEEE 9 bus, and IEEE 39 bus test systems to investigate how different levels of large scale solar PV penetrations will impact on the overall system frequency response. The results suggest that the increasing share of solar generation in the generation mix will result in the reduction of total system inertia. Hence, the system becomes more susceptible to disturbance and contingency events. The study also shows that the system will collapse during the worst case contingency situation when the solar PV penetrations are over 40% of the system's generating capacity.",

        "abstract": "The time of arrival (TOA) estimation algorithms are evaluated for the local area multilateration (LAM) system at the Salzburg airport W. A. Mozart in Austria. The LAM system consists of 14 strategically distributed sensors with decentralized time-synchronization. The evaluation compares the rising edge detection time of arrival estimator (REDTOE) algorithm [1] with state-of-the art algorithms according the given minimum operational performance specifications EUROCAE ED-117 [2] for all maneuvering areas on ground. Airports are typically hosting a high number of constructions such as hangars, masts or shelters, so that multipath overlapping propagation is likely to happen. Especially when having multipath, the REDTOE algorithm has its benefits by improving the TOA accuracy. Herein we have shown that the REDTOE algorithm achieves better results than common known algorithms in a real-world LAM evaluated according ED-117 position accuracy specifications.",

        "abstract": "Existing spectrum has been re-purposed by OFCOM for use in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This work presents a new approach to a propagation study undertaken at the conventionally used IoT frequency of 869MHz and the repurposed frequency of 71MHz, with the intention of comparing the two frequencies within an urban IoT use case. The current conventional approach to conducting propagation studies involves taking readings with expensive lab spectrum analysers. In our work Software Defined Radio (SDR) techniques and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware is used to produce a low cost, flexible measurement platform. This will facilitates studies with real world measurements of the RF environment and the results of this are shown for an area of Sheffield. Results are presented in comparison to currently established propagation models to determine their suitability and as \"heat maps\" of the test area to show how the results correspond to the physical geography of the area. Measurements are taken with lower antenna heights and at shorter distances than current analytical models encompass, in order to suit IoT use cases.",

        "abstract": "Microwave mammography is a promising alternative from the X-ray based imaging modality, in terms of compactness, low cost and cell-friendly exposure. This paper focuses on the accuracy enhancement by incorporating breast surface boundary extraction into the inverse scattering analysis algorithm, known as distorted born iterative method (DBIM). Many studies have reported that the reconstruction accuracy of the DBIM or other inverse scattering algorithms largely depends on an initial estimate of boundary surrounding object, namely, skin surface shape of breast media. The Envelope method achieves highly accurate boundary extraction by processing a group of reflection time-delays. The accuracy of boundary extraction of Envelope depends on that of time-delay estimation, which is mostly processed by the filter based on waveform matching between observed and reference signals. However, the coupling effect between an antenna and a breast surface deforms an observed waveforms from reference one. To mitigate this problem, this paper introduces the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)-based waveform correction for more accurate boundary extraction. Numerical simulations based on realistic breast phantoms derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the accuracy for the DBIM based reconstruction of dielectric profile in highly heterogeneous case.",

To tackle this problem, a frequency diverse array (FDA) based SAR processing scheme is proposed. Considering that the transmit steering vector of FDA depends on the actual range and angle of the scattering point, while the propagation paths of time-delay modulation based deceptive jamming and real target are different, which implies that the transmit frequency of jamming is mismatched with its position in SAR image. Therefore it can be suppressed in transmit frequency domain by implementing beam forming. In the end, the effectiveness is verified by simulations.",

We present a new approach for motion estimation and correction of thermographic images in brain surgery. In a pre-processing step, the Phase Correlation (PC) method is performed in order to detect large displacements of objects in two successive images. Additionally, due to noise in thermographic images, a Cellular Nonlinear Network (CNN) based image enhancement method is applied. Then, in the following processing step, the Optical Flow (OF) method is employed to compensate local motion artifacts. The proposed algorithm is evaluated during an offline analysis of the recorded dataset of brain surgeries and the performance evaluation between different algorithms is made based on the determination of the Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC). The results clearly indicate that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce breathing motion artifacts effectively as well as the NCC evaluation show better results in comparison to other mentioned algorithms.",

In this paper, we present our experience in running experiments for estimation of QoE for a WebRTC video stream in Mobile Broadband (MBB) networks based on Quality of Service (QoS) measurements. For majority of our experiments we exploited the MONROE platform, which is the first open access platform that gives access to several hundreds of nodes for large-scale experiments in commercial MBB in Europe. For analysis of obtained QoS measurements we used a combination of subjective quality assessment and a machine learning approach.",

It is based on the concept of utilizing the received signals reflected from the Earth's surface. Several GNSS-R system configurations were proposed depending on different retrieval algorithms. In a GNSS-R system, the antenna plays a key role as a receiving component. In this paper, in-situ measurements using a commercial dual circular polarized antenna receiving both the left-hand and right-hand circular polarization reflected from the ground are analyzed. A low cost and compact dual-port circular polarized patch antenna is designed and realized to overcome the limitations of the previous configuration.

        "abstract": "Developers commonly define tasks to help coordinate software development efforts--whether they be feature implementation, refactoring, or bug fixes. Developers establish links between tasks to express implicit dependencies that needs explicit handling--dependencies that often require the developers responsible for a given task to assess how changes in a linked task affect their own work and vice versa (i.e., change propagation). While seemingly useful, it is unknown if change propagation indeed coincides with task links. No study has investigated to what extent change propagation actually occurs between task pairs and whether it is able to serve as a metric for characterizing the underlying task dependency. In this paper, we study the temporal relationship between developer reading and changing of source code in relationship to task links. We identify seven situations that explain the varying correlation of change propagation with linked task pairs and find six motifs describing when change propagation occurs between non-linked task pairs. Our paper demonstrates that task links are indeed useful for recommending which artifacts to monitor for changes, which developers to involve in a task, or which tasks to inspect.",

In an IoT world, sensor enabled objects (things) are connected together via the Internet to participate in performing a particular task mainly by sending and receiving data from one to other. Artificial intelligence empowers agents (machines or devices) to perceive the surrounding environments leading to take calculative decisions, followed by performing efficient actions in order to maximizing the chances of successfully accomplishing a desired task or goal. In this research, we combine both IoT and AI to reduce traffic congestions in a smart city environment. A detailed literature review has been conducted and a simple solution based on AI Algorithm has been proposed. Future directions of the research has also been identified and advocated.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing allows high-resolution imaging independent of weather conditions and sunlight illumination and is therefore very attractive for the systematic observation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface. As a consequence of the pulsed operation of SAR, however, nadir echoes and range ambiguities may significantly affect the SAR image quality, if the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is not conveniently constrained in the design of spaceborne SAR systems. As these constrains typically limit both the swath width and the ambiguity performance of the SAR system, the investigation of novel concepts for nadir echo and range ambiguity suppression is of great interest. Waveform-encoded SAR allows suppression (not only smearing) of the nadir echoes and range ambiguities by means of waveform diversity on transmit and multifocus post-processing. This technique yields improved image quality and increased flexibility in the design of novel SAR systems.",

Aspects like non-stationarity, spatial consistency and spherical wavefronts become important for proper modeling of such channels. This campaign is designed to measure and investigate these aspects of the channel. The paper includes analyses of the angular statistics and the dual directional power angular spectrum for a few locations. Next, the paths/clusters are mapped to a 2D map for visualisation of clusters. Finally, non-stationarity across the large array aperture is investigated in terms of angular statistics and power.",

        "abstract": "Smart urban objects are an innovative type of physical objects equipped with sensors, information processing capability and actuators, and located in a public urban area. These objects can enhance usability of the urban environment by adapting parameters to individual needs of pedestrians. However, fairness problems occur if multiple pedestrians with incongruent needs wish to use the same object simultaneously. This research proposes a method for establishing a fair configuration of smart urban objects that are used by multiple pedestrians at the same time. Therefore, I develop an adaption rule based on economic fairness models to establish a welfare-egalitarian configuration of smart urban objects for the case of two concurrent users. The simulation-based evaluation provides evidence that using the adaption rule both enhances fairness and utilitarian welfare compared to using non-adaption.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and measurement of a novel transmit-array (TA) that is able to combine wide beam steering and high gain for two distinct frequency bands. The TA is designed for a mobile ground platform to operate at satellite communications in the Ka-bands: Rx (19.7–20.2 GHz) and Tx (29.5–30.0 GHz). A 28 dBi gain is obtained for 30 GHz and 24 dBi for 20 GHz. The zenith beam steering results from a linear displacement of the aperture (196 × 147 mm2) in front of a stationary feed. A scanning range of 50° was obtained with 2dB scan loss. Overall, the dual-band TA performs as well as if two independent single band apertures were designed.",

Transferring enormous amount of data from UAV-mounted cameras or sensors requires significantly larger bandwidths compared to the command and control system. This results in the need of utilizing higher carrier frequencies, e.g. 2 GHz and above. As novel hardware development relies on underlying propagation channel models for the envisaged scenarios, which may range from deeply shadowed to line-of-sight, we focus here on obtaining and processing the relevant experimental datasets which enable us to develop or tune the particular models correctly. This paper studies three selected scenarios consisting of cluttered environment where individual propagation states of a Markov chain model are identified. The identification process of such states is described.",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for in-flight broadband connectivity. Some airlines are already deployed satellite-based solutions, which have low data rate and high latency. In order to tackle these problems, direct air-to-ground communication (DA2GC), where a direct link between a ground station and an airplane is established, is a promising solution. The resource utilization in DA2GC systems can be enhanced with the introduction of multi-user beamforming techniques, where each airplane has its dedicated beam and exploits a larger portion of the spectrum available to DA2GC. Even with multiuser beamforming technique, some airplanes may experience low data rates due to interference caused by beams aimed at airplanes in the mutual vicinity. The probability that two or more beams will interfere is higher with longer inter-site distance or wider beamwidth, which is often the case for DA2GC systems. To address significant research problem, we propose a coordinated resource allocation scheme with beam selection and spectrum allocation. The proposed beam selection scheme coordinates the neighboring base stations such that the number of airplanes sharing the same beam is minimized. In addition, the proposed coordinated spectrum allocation scheme maximizes the minimum amount of spectrum dedicated for each airplane. According to our results, the proposed coordinated beam selection with efficient spectrum allocation improves average capacity available per airplane by 60% in comparison with the uncoordinated scheme.",

In order to realize public transit priority and meet the requirements of social vehicles flow, a traffic signal timing model for single intersections with the goal of minimum delay of each passenger is established, and a dynamic self-adaptive chaotic particles swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the model. This algorithm introduces dynamic self-adaptive strategy and chaotic optimization strategy to solve the prematurity and low optimization ability of standard particle swarm optimization algorithm. Simulation experiments show that the proposed model and algorithm have good practicability; a better signal timing plan can be obtained through the proposed algorithm, and delays decrease to certain extent in social vehicles, public transit and each passenger.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we provide the results of broadband channel measurements in an old railway tunnel at two carrier frequencies, namely 4 and 6 GHz, and two channel bandwidths: 500 MHz and 1 GHz. The UWB signal at carrier frequency of 4 GHz exhibits higher path loss compared to the 6 GHz signal in observed tunnel environment while the signal with 1 GHz bandwidth shows lower path loss compared to the 500 MHz signal. The delay spread is increasing with distance between transmitter and receiver; however, at the transmitter proximity a decrease of the rms delay spread is observed resulting in the rms delay spread minimum at 10 to 15 m from the transmitter. The three slope channel model for broadband UWB radio channels comprising of path loss and rms delay spread functions, is also proposed applying measured signal strength and channel impulse response values.",

Technological advances in flexible skin-attachable strain sensors over the last decade have made them attractive for medical applications, in particular, out-of-the-clinic health monitoring. Here we report a novel highly stretchable strain sensor based on a compressive buckling technique for on-body applications. Our suggested sensor is able to measure 0 to 60% strain with the frequency shift in the range of 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz while keeping the on-skin antenna gain greater than −11 dBi. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using COMSOL Multiphysics® 5.3a was adopted to analyse the buckling behaviour of the 2D metallic precursor as well as the antenna performance. Numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data.",

        "abstract": "This paper is about performance space exploration for analog circuits by means of Pareto optimization. The aim of the proposed scheme is to generate evenly spread points on its enclosing surfaces, based on spice-simulation results. Advanced methods are applied for a successive approximation of all possible trade-offs. The Normal Boundary Intersection method is used not only for optimal trade-off points, but also to explore the opposite and adjoining boundaries. As a result, we get points on the boundary of the complete feasible performance space. The method described, is shown on a two stage transconductance amplifier in CMOS technology, with two different topology improvements. Three competing performance parameters are taken into account. Advantages of such performance space models could be graphical topology or technology comparison and high level modeling of transistor level circuits.",

This paper provides a method on how a single-axis and dual-axis solar tracking method can be performed through a technique by tracking the sun according to the sun's irradiation. Two LDR sensors and a motor is used for single-axis tracking system and 4 LDR sensors and 2 motors for dual-axis tracking system. Voltage and current readings from the solar panel rated 7.5 V have been rescaled usingvoltage divider circuit. The readings are then calculated by the microcontroller and have been displayed to a Display (GLCD). All simulation experiments have been tested using commercially-available Proteus simulation software. Measurement of voltage, current, and power calculated and recorded by the microcontroller are accurate with about 1.4% error. The system operations were successful whereby the software programming when connected to an actual circuit will be able to track the sun by the sun's light intensity.",

        "abstract": "With circular flight tracks ships can be observed over the full aspect angle range of 360deg with long observation times limited only by the endurance of the aircraft. Additionally to the improved probability of detection an inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) image sequence of the ships as well as a sequence of high range resolution profiles (HRRP) can be obtained. The ISAR images and HRRPs can be used for target classification and recognition purposes in a post-processing step. In the paper a generic ISAR processing chain is discussed which can be used for ISAR imaging and HRRP generation for arbitrary radar platform flight tracks. Furthermore, polarimetric ISAR imaging results of a controlled police ship and of ships of opportunity are presented. The used fully polarimetric X- and L-band radar data were simultaneously acquired with DLR's airborne sensor F-SAR [9] during a North Sea flight campaign in 2016.",

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was identified as a good technique for gas turbine modelling. However, ANN is sensitive to its hyperparameters. Current approaches for optimizing the hyperparameters of ANN used in gas turbine modelling has high computational cost. Hence, this paper proposes optimizing the ANN hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization. Bayesian optimization was used to determine the near-optimum number of layers and number of neurons for the developed gas turbine model. The result shows hyperparameters optimization using Bayesian optimization results neural network with better prediction accuracy compared to hyperparameters optimization using random search.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of recent methods for recognition of human emotions based on Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and related applications. The major challenges in emotion modeling (affective computing) from ECG data are finding representations that are invariant to inter- and intra-subject differences, as well as the inherent noise associated with the ECG data recordings. The most common invariant features (in frequency and time domain) extracted from the raw ECG signals are outlined. The reviewed studies reveal the great potential of ECG to decode basic human emotional states such as joy, sadness, anger, fear in combination with other physiological signals and facial expression. Major application areas cover patient monitoring, marketing, car driving.",

Excellent port matching and radiation performance are demonstrated through simulations of the complete antenna that is fed with 11 waveguides.",

        "abstract": "Reference architectural models are coherent representations/blueprints of the interaction existing between homogeneous/heterogeneous groups of systems, technologies, and users in complex business domains. Due to its complexity, the smart city domain should embrace a reference architectural model which facilitates coherent capabilities of the interacting application, and infrastructure's capabilities in a certain geographical area from one side and their relevant business users from the other side. Limited reference architectural models were proposed for smart city purposes. However, they lacked coherency, practicality, or quality. This paper discusses the empirical findings of smart cities derived from the literature review articles, investigates Bahrain's readiness for smartness, and proposes the development of a Bahraini Smart City-Technological Reference Architectural Model (BSC-TRAM), based on the insights of federal enterprise architecture framework. The BSC-TRAM was developed based on data collected from 10 public, semipublic, and private organizations, through literature review, interviews, and website content analysis. Findings revealed the availability of 17 Business functions which serve 17 public ministries, 16 directorates, 35 bodies, and 18 private economic units. Also, results revealed 26 application functions and 130 applications categories, and 7 infrastructure functions and 18 infrastructures categories.",

In this paper, the basic form of IWs and scattering theory is investigated to simulate IWs in SAR images under different combination of radar parameters. The optimal observation conditions can be yield by comparing the results of simulation, which is advantageous to improve the precision of parameter estimation of IWs by SAR sensor. A new method is proposed to analyze the influence on internal wave imaging under different polarizations. The results of simulation and experiments prove that the proposed analyzing method is efficient for observation and inversion of IWs in SAR images.",

        "abstract": "Due to transmit power limits and spherical spreading, the received RF power levels in radiative Wireless Power Transfer systems are very low. The RF-to-DC Power Conversion Efficiency of the receiver's rectifier therefore is of paramount importance. This efficiency can be increased by applying a multi-sine excitation at the transmitter. Here, we propose to use a pulse-delayed array excitation as a special form of multi-sine excitation. As reported earlier, this excitation will lead to the creation of a focal area with high energy density at the location of the receiver. In this paper, we discuss practical considerations for increasing the peak- and average-power level in the focal area. We find that, relative to an array excited with non-delayed pulses, we may expect at the focal position a peak-power gain up to the number of array elements squared and an average-power gain between zero and the number of array elements. The array size is in the order of the distance to the focal point. The array is best used for focusing in front of and to the side of the array, so that for a complete forward coverage two arrays should be used.",

This paper introduces the design and hardware implementation of smart energy management systems to be applied for Bahrain smart cities development. The system is capable of monitoring the energy consumed by the appliances, and accordingly limits the overall consumption not to exceed a certain stated threshold. Therefore, the user gets foreknowledge of their own energy consumption before getting the official electricity bill. The design implementation based on using Arduino UNO micro-controller, and ACS712 current sensor which measures the alternating current (AC) drawn by an appliance, and XBee transceiver which provides wireless communication with the coordinator node. The design was tested on real testbed, as the results showed that the power consumption drop down reached about 20%.",

The antenna consists of wideband crossed bowtie dipoles placed on top of wideband artificial magnetic conductor (AMC). This results in a wideband, low profile, circular polarized antenna that has a thickness of 0.067 lambda at the lowest operation frequencies of the GNSS bands. The simulation results shows that the antenna has a very good impedance matching, axial ratio below 3 dB and efficiency higher than 90 % over all GNSS bands. The phase center and variation are also presented in this paper to show the stability of the antenna performance for GNSS applications.",

        "abstract": "Planar transmission lines are frequently used to characterize the RF properties of materials. However, the question arises which geometry should be chosen for optimal measurement sensitivity to the material under test. Thus far, this question appears to go unanswered. In this paper, the suitability of the three most popular planar geometries is compared for material characterization. To this end, the impact of a material under test on the apparent properties (i.e. the equivalent homogeneous cross-sections) is examined. This is done for the complex permittivity and the complex permeability, using conformal mapping methods, full-wave simulations and measurements. It is shown that the coplanar waveguide (without conductor backing) is the most suitable structure of the three, since it is the most sensitive to changes in the properties of the material under test.",

The research of actuation system is of great significance to the sustainable development goals of large passenger aircraft and large transport aircraft. In recent years, with the development of the system and equipment in the direction of multi-function and automation, the composition of the system is becoming more and more complex. In addition to the influence of many factors such as the worse flight environment and so on, the safety research work of the multi electric aircraft becomes more important. The safety assessment has become a design analysis which must be carried out in the design process of the flight control actuating system for multi electric aircraft. In this paper, the safety evaluation of the electrical actuating system is carried out to provide a useful reference for the development of the flight control actuating system for the airliner.",

On the other hand, the digital hardware utilized in multi-channel SAR systems, offer entirely new opportunities for the calibration such as on-board error correction and digital calibration. An internal calibration strategy for future digital beamforming SAR instruments is detailed and its performance analyzed using a dedicated calibration simulator software.",

For this purpose, brain waves obtained from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp (EEG, Electroencephalogram) are used. Emotiv Epoc used to obtain EEG signals is a low-cost device and has real-time applications. The aim of this study is the detection of rest, imagination and real movement using EEG signals obtained by Emotiv Epoc headset. As a result, As a result, the data obtained from 39 trials from a female subject were classified resting, motion imagination and movement, according to 97.4% accuracy by using the statistical features of distortion, logarithm energy entropy, energy, Shannon entropy and kurtosis. In this study, it has been shown that this system can be remarkably successful for BCI applications.",

        "abstract": "The integration of distributed generators (DGs) considering renewable energy provides great benefits to the distribution networks, such as, reductions in power loss and improvements of voltage profile. However, such benefits to the distribution networks are constrained with the installation of DGs with proper sizes and locations. In this paper, the optimization for sizing and placement of distributed renewable generators (DRGs) in the electrical distribution networks is presented. The optimum sizes and locations for the DRGs are determined to reduce the power loss in the distribution networks. The genetic algorithm (GA) has been used to solve the optimization problem using MATLAB. For the validation, results of this study are compared with other well-known heuristic optimization techniques and analytical approaches. The numerical studies on the IEEE 33 bus distribution network have revealed that the proposed algorithm is capable for finding the optimum size and place of DRG in the distribution networks. The optimization results using GA are seen very competitive with the result by other well-known heuristic optimization techniques and analytical approaches that have been used for the similar studies. The results from this study signify the use of GA in the research related to planning of renewable energy and power system.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive model of combinable single-phase source based on SiC MOSFET for the Electrical Power System (EPS) of helicopter ground support is investigated in this paper. This model is composed of three parts which has the ability to output single-phase 115 V/400 Hz for the EPS architecture under study. The double loop control is adopted in the primary part of ‘the three-phase Voltage Source PWM Rectifier (VSR)’. In the second part, ‘Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter’ is accomplished by phase shifting control. And ‘single-phase voltage source PWM inverter (VSI)’ is accomplished by droop control in the tertiary part. This comprehensive model can be operated in parallel to expand the output power of single-phase AC source. Furthermore, three-phase AC source is obtained by star connection scheme of output port. The simulation results based on Matlab/Simulink show that the parallel single-phase AC source model can meet the output power requirement; more significantly, it can share the output active/reactive power quickly. In addition, the three-phase AC sources model has an ability to resist load imbalance.",

Projection transformation is then applied to establish pixel correspondence between the reference ISAR image and the other images. In reconstruction, a factorization method is carried out to obtain the 3D coordinates of every pixel of the target. Our simulation experiment of a cuboid and satellite demonstrates the efficiency of proposed method.",

The causation of OA estimation accuracy is discussed, which explains the inefficacy of detection using OA values. The existing detection methods for largely-oriented structures cannot distinguish largely-oriented structures from mountainous areas, in order to solve this problem, a method using alpha angle and a proper threshold is proposed. The threshold is obtained by analyses of RADARSAT-2 data. Statistics indicate that the classification accuracy of largely-oriented structures and mountainous areas can reach 95%.",

A cache-enabled heterogeneous cellular network architecture is considered in this paper, where mobile users connect to multiple SBSs during a video downloading session, and the SBSs request files, or fragments of files, from the macro-cell base station (MBS) according to the user requests they receive. A novel coded storage and delivery scheme is introduced to reduce the load on the backhaul link from the MBS to the SBSs. The achievable backhaul delivery rate as well as the number of sub-files required to achieve this rate are studied for the proposed coded delivery scheme, and it is shown that the proposed scheme provides significant reduction in the number of sub-files required, making it more viable for practical applications.",

As a beamforming network, a hybrid architecture can be used that enables reduction of the number of RF transceiver channels and using a low-dimensional digital base-band signal processing. Fourier Rotman Lens, which provides beam patterns orthogonality, can be used as an analog part of the hybrid beamforming network, which can be modified by using additional power dividers to decrease the number of lens array ports. The simulated radiation patterns are discussed for different values of the number of outputs ports. The results of simulations have been verified by far-field measurements.",

Based on the nature of the application, these devices result in big or fast/real time data streams. The analytics technique on the subject matter used to discover new information, anticipate future predictions and make decisions on important issues makes IoT technology valuable for both the business world and the quality of everyday life. In this study, first of all, the concept of IoT and its architecture and relation with big and streaming data are emphasized. Information discovery process applied to the IoT streaming data is investigated and deep learning frameworks covered by this process are described comparatively. Finally, the most commonly used tools for analyzing IoT stream data are introduced and their characteristics are revealed.",

A circuit known from power electronics, the so-called buck converter, is evaluated. Buck converters are frequently used power supplies in LED illumination systems, and provide high efficiencies at low complexity. To demonstrate the ability of this type of converter for the purpose of data modulation, discrete multitone transmission (DMT) is used in numerical results. The circuit has been simulated in LTSpice. The bit error rate (BER) is determined for different system parameters.",

        "abstract": "Rain attenuation is the most critical source of impairments in satellite systems operating at frequencies above 10 GHz. At low elevation angles the attenuation increases severely and its modeling requires a specific formulation in addition to simple geometric scaling. In systems based on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites where the link moves from very low elevations up to highest ones, the knowledge on the characterization of rain attenuation at these low elevations is essential. This paper presents a model able to generate time series of rain attenuation at low elevation angles. The procedure uses rain attenuation episodes obtained from the ITALSAT database at 39.6 GHz and 37.7° elevation and is able to generate time series that reproduce the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of rain attenuation down to 5°. The paper presents some preliminary results obtained with this procedure. This is a fundamental step towards the development of a LEO Rain Attenuation Time Series Generator.",

In order to succeed, a development of new air-ground propagation channel models are necessary for UAVs to improve communications links for control and high capacity for the transmission of payload information. In this paper, measurements are carried out in wideband with a channel sounder developed which uses narrow pulse technique. Power delay profile measurements and parameters such as RMS-Delay Spread or average delay profile are analyzed for vertical and horizontal flights in sub-urban environments at L-band. The results show that multipath propagation decreases at higher altitudes.",

LCP stands out among other polymer materials used for microelectronics. The permeability for water and gases is the lowest among all polymeric materials. With proper design considerations LCP packages can achieve a sufficient hermeticity for exposures in harsh environments.",

During the use of the viewpoint-related LOD quadtree technology, unmarked virtual reality scenes can be effectively marked by these viewpoint-related LOD quadtree techniques. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm, a hybrid feature is used to characterize the virtual reality scene so that the stereoscopic parallax generation process can be completed quickly. Experimental results show that the proposed viewpoint-related LOD quadtree can effectively generate stereoscopic parallax in virtual scenes.",
