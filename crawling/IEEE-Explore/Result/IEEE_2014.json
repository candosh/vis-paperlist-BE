Due to preformed studies, voltage source converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) system is the best option for realising future multi-terminal HVDC system to integrate bulk amount of energy over long distances to the AC grid. The most important drawback of VSC-HVDC systems is their need for fast HVDC circuit breakers.

        "abstract": "Monitoring critical temperatures in electric motors is crucial for preventing shortened motor life spans due to excessive thermal stress. With regard to permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM), critical temperatures can occur in the magnets and the stator end winding. While excessive magnet temperatures involve the risk of irreversible demagnetization when operating the motor in flux weakening mode, exceeding the thermal limits of the stator windings can destroy the insulation varnish. As directly measuring temperatures, especially on the rotating part, is costly and thus not applicable with respect to automotive applications, model-based approaches are preferred. In this paper, a low-order thermal model for accurate temperature predictions in the permanent magnets, the windings and the end windings is introduced. The model parameters are estimated solely based on experimental data via a sequence of interdependent identification steps. The model performance is validated by experimental results based on a high-speed PMSM typically used as traction motor in subcompact electric cars."

Among many types of designs, hybrid magnet memory motor (HMMM) has highest torque density. This paper investigates the cross coupling effect of HMMM in the motor topology proposed by Sakai. The analysis model is introduced firstly. Based on the magnetic circuit model, the mechanism of opencircuit cross coupling effect is investigated while the ideal condition for eliminating this effect is proposed. Later, the on-load cross coupling effect is also analysed by both magnetic circuit model and 2D FEA focusing on coercive force (Hc) of magnet and interaction between two types of magnets as well as magnetic saturation. Meanwhile, the magnetization characteristics are calculated as well. The results show that increasing Hc of low coercive force (LCF) magnet can reduce the cross coupling effect but increase the difficulty of online magnetization. Therefore, a trade-off exists for choosing proper LCF magnet in HMMM."

If the inductance of the main circuit is large, it will cause a large surge voltage when switched. Therefore, we have incorporated the optimum low inductance structure into this module, and have made it possible to drive the SiC device at high speed. Using this module, we have built a prototype of inverter unit with 75 kW output power, and have achieved an efficiency of 99% and a power density of 100 kW/L."

Due to the complex features of UAV MANET, the development of UAV MANET faces many technical challenges, such as routing. Generally speaking, Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol gives better performance on delay compare to AODV protocol, so the OLSR protocol meets the high demand for real-time of UAV communication. High mobility and load imbalanced are two significant characteristics of UAV networks. The performance of UAV networks is largely affected by these characteristics. In order to reduce the effects of these problems, a Mobility and Load aware OLSR (ML-OLSR) protocol is proposed in this paper. The mobility-aware algorithm and load-aware algorithm are introduced to the OLSR protocol. The modelling and simulation of the ML-OLSR protocol was completed within QualNet simulator. Simulation results show that ML-OLSR outperforms the original OLSR protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio and average end-to-end delay."

This paper provides classification of the IoT platforms and proposes a top-level generic IoT architecture particularly suited for the creation of smart cities."

        "abstract": "In this paper, a modified staircase modulation is proposed which enables more efficient use of the DC link voltage. This is very preferable feature for HVDC transmission systems as the 15% lower DC link voltage can be used (lower number of cells). In the second part of the paper the capacitor balancing of modular multilevel converter (MMC) converter is investigated. Balancing becomes a significant issue when the number of the converter levels is high. For instance, with a 401-level MMC converter, the converter comprises 400 cells per arm per phase. This means that 2400 capacitors have to be measured and fed back to the controller for balancing. The system will not be only impractical but also unreliable and complex. A new capacitor balancing strategy is proposed to enhance the system reliability and eliminate the capacitor voltage sensors. A simple example of 7-level converter is presented to explain basic principles of the proposed technique. The proposed method performance is validated by studying a 21-level MMC based VSC-HVDC system."

This paper investigates the current methodologies for MTDC control stating their limitations for severe contingency conditions and proposes a control strategy able to ensure grid reliability and voltage stability in the case of a sudden outage of the converter station controlled in Vdc-Q. This strategy, acting on the Vdc reference signal, allows the presence of multiple master converters in the DC grid. A five-terminal DC scheme, which connects onshore AC systems with offshore wind farms, has been developed in RT-Lab Simulator. Each sub-station (terminal) is equipped with a modular multilevel converter (MMC). The converters are either Vdc-Q controlled (master stations) or are P-Q (with droop control) or Vac-frequency regulated. The dynamic response of the system is observed after a converter outage to assess the validity of the proposed DC voltage control strategy."

Passive filters are employed in order to attenuate the generated switching current ripples and reduces resonances between the grid and the inverter. The first-order (L), the second-order (LC), and the third-order (LCL) filters topologies are typical filters for grid connected Voltage Source Inverters (VSI). Practically, due to the system size, weight, and cost requirements, the LCL filter is the most commonly used among others for the integration of the three phase VSI into the grid. However, the control system stability is affected by the underdamping characteristic of the LCL filter therefore, it introduces to challenges to the control problem. Numerous control strategies such as repetitive, predictive, multiloop control, and hysteresis regulation have been proposed in order to improve the stability of the grid-connected VSIs. In this paper, the performance of the third order LCL filter-based gridconnected three-phase VSI is evaluated and the system stability is investigated using a two-loop control approach with both passive and active damping. The two-loop control considers the grid current as the outer loop while for the inner loop, different variables are considered such as capacitor voltage, capacitor current, and inductor current."

The high cost of such a system has led to investigations of using second life transportation batteries to provide an alternative energy storage capability. However, the reliability and performance of these batteries is unclear and multi-modular power electronics with redundancy have been suggested as a means of helping with this issue. This paper reviews work already undertaken on battery failure rate to suggest suitable figures for use in reliability calculations. The paper then uses reliability analysis and a numerical example to investigate six different multi-modular topologies and suggests how the number of series battery strings and power electronic module redundancy should be determined for the lowest hardware cost using a numerical example. The results reveal that the cascaded dc-side modular with single inverter is the lowest cost solution for a range of battery failure rates."

        "abstract": "Thermal design and modelling in electrical machines is important because it allows a proper choice of materials, avoids de-rating of the machine and eliminates excessive safety factors thus achieving higher current densities. In high current density electrical machines, particularly those making use of liquid cooled housing jackets for heat removal, the stator to housing thermal contact resistance is on the main heat removal path of the electrical machine. So far it has always been assumed that this parameter is dependent on the shrink fit manufacturing procedure of the machine. However this paper provides experimental evidence showing that the thermal contact resistance not only varies with shrink fit pressure but is also affected by heat flux and temperature. Hence the common notion that the thermal contact resistance is a constant value set during the machine assembly, and that during thermal design this value can be applied across the whole operating range of the machine is an over simplification. The paper presents arbitrary correlations showing the variation of thermal contact resistance with heat flux and shrink fit pressure and compares the measured values with values quoted in the literature."

A control strategy able to coordinate the different resources of islanded systems, aiming to preserve voltage and frequency stability, is needed. Differently from other works, the authors have developed an approach able to coordinate active and reactive generation output with storage systems requirements and features, making no use of remote communications between different points of the system. The control strategy acts on frequency and voltage in order to reduce as much as possible the power exchanges between the storage system and the network. This means involving mainly generators in supplying load requirements. In this way, the storage system can provisionally compensate significant events in terms of active and reactive balance, as shown in the reported simulations."

To address this issue, a systematic approach has been suggested in this paper to compensate for the network latency in the application of synchrophasor assisted wide area control for the Static Var Compensator (SVC). The power oscillation modes are estimated online in presence of packet drop in a communication network. The modes are monitored through a modified Modified Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) approach. The time delay has been compensated by predicting the dynamics of the delayed measurement signal. A network control system model has been developed incorporating the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), event driven communication network and network buffers to mimic the response of a real time communication based control. The wide-area stabilizing controller has been designed based on Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy approach. The performance of the proposed delay compensation scheme has been tested on 39-bus New England system."

The suggested energy storage system is connected to the dc-link of an elevator motor drive through a bidirectional dc-dc converter and the braking energy is stored at the supercapacitor bank. Aim of the control scheme is to ensure power supply to the elevator motor as possible from the temporary stored energy of the supercapacitors, in order to minimize the power consumption from the grid. Also, since the capacitance of the supercapacitor and consequently the energy storage capability reduces with increasing frequency, the proposed control scheme aims to provide smooth charging and discharging performance. This is attained by optimally controlling the dc-dc power converter through a new control technique that takes into account any variations of the ac supply voltage to the elevator motor drive and also on-line adjusting the dc-link voltage Proportional-Integral (PI) controller parameters according to the elevator operating conditions. Several simulation results are presented to demonstrate the resulting improvements of the suggested control scheme."

Indicators used for evaluation of smart city models mainly based on ICT platform do not include build environment characteristics. Proposed seven smart components system (7SCCS) structured in this paper, considers the built environment as a foundation of the smart city infrastructure. Critical reviews of the theory emphasize a leading role of the ICT in the development of smart cities and, at present, the theory is winning a growing support from many experts and ICT organisations and companies. However, the ICT-led model together with business-led models may produce negative effects on interface dynamics of smart cites components system.

        "abstract": "The hybrid-excited switched-flux permanent magnet machines (HESFPMMs) have the potential for many applications, such as electric vehicles and aerospace. However, in the flux weakening region, it is usually difficult to determine the excitation current, while the extra copper loss due to field excitation may cause significant reduction in the machine performance especially efficiency. Therefore, a new control strategy for the HESFPMMs, which can operate in both flux-enhancing and flux-weakening regions, has been proposed. It utilises a novel feature of HESFPMMs in which the flux produced by the permanent magnets can be inherently shortcircuited via the iron flux-bridges. Hence, in this proposed method, the field excitation current is set to zero in order to avoid the copper loss of the field winding in the flux weakening region. Meanwhile, it utilizes the voltage difference between the command and real voltages, and does not require the machine parameters to modify the excitation current reference in flux-enhancing mode and the d-axis current reference in flux-weakening mode. In addition, in order to improve the tracking accuracy of the excitation current, the current feedback control is employed. As a result, the proposed method can provide a smooth speed transition from flux-enhancing mode to flux-weakening mode. It is verified by the experiments and can also be implemented for other hybrid-excited machines."

However, detecting hardware Trojan is extremely difficult due to Trojans are always triggered by rare events. Side-channel signal analysis is effective in detecting Trojan but facing the challenge with process variation and environment noise in nanotechnology. Moreover, side-channel approaches that analyze global signals cannot scale well to large circuits. This paper presents a heuristic partition and test pattern generation based localized signal analysis method for hardware Trojan detection. First, we partition the design into regions controlled by scan chains. Then a test vector ordering algorithm is used to generate optimized vectors which can magnify the activity in the target region where Trojan may be located. At last, power ports are placed in each region to measure the localized transient current anomalies for Trojan detection, while a signal calibration technique is used to eliminate the negative effect of process variation and noise. We evaluate our approach on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits and the results show that the proposed scheme can magnify the detection sensitivity in multiples from the state-of-the-art. Two further benefits of this method are that it can scale well to large circuits and determine Trojan's location."

A probabilistic model for Small Scale Energy Resources (SSERs) and load demand is used at each SSEZs to determine the optimal scheduling of microgrids with minimum operating cost. The power transaction between MGs and between MGs and the main is regulated based on the total operating cost and regarding the sold or purchase power either by microgrids or by main grid. The stochastically analysis of generated power with SSERs and their corresponding costs is determined considering optimization constraints and explained as PDF and CDF. The Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm are applied to comparative study of the results as optimization algorithms.

        "abstract": "Dynamic state estimation is a useful tool for bad data detection and identification. However so far no dynamic state estimator considers the state constraints like zeros injection constraints in power system. In this paper, a new dynamic state estimator based on the projected unscented Kalman filter (PUKF) is presented. It is based on the application of unscented transformation and estimate-projection combined with the Kalman filter theory. The proposed method can improve the approximation of power system nonlinearity and guarantee that the estimated state vectors obey zeros injection constraints. Four tests for different conditions including normal operating condition, gross bad data condition, sudden load change condition and topology error condition are taken to verify the performance of the proposed method."

Post-fault operation must preserve the current ratings of the system and should also maximize the generated power by means of a proper flux adjustment. Both requirements are achieved in this work using a non-linear optimization analysis and some modifications in the control scheme. Simulation results confirm the optimal and safe performance of the wind energy system under study."

When voltage sag occurs due to grid side fault, the series compensator of the UPQC injects required voltage to prevent disconnecting of FSIG wind turbine. On the other hand, faults produced by wind turbine generator systems will impact not only the wind farms but also the interconnected system including the grid if proper protection is not ensured. Therefore, the resistive SFCL incorporated in series with the dc-link inductance of UPQC is proposed to limit excessive current in the event of the generator side fault. Detailed simulation studies implemented in PSCAD/EMTDC confirm that both of resistive SFCL and large dc-link inductance are effective in decreasing the fault current thereby reducing the voltage dip at the generator terminal."

        "abstract": "In a microgrid (MG) with high penetration of single phase induction motors (SPIMs), the voltage recovery process after a fault-induced islanding can be very slow. The reason lies in the stall of SPIMs caused by low voltage. During stalling, a SPIM can withdraw as high as three times of its rated power. This phenomenon can cause many problems including the loss of critical load due to the action of protection devices. This paper explores the role of reactive power support during MG islanding and proposes a novel approach to managing the reactive power generation of electronic-interfaced distributed generators (EIDGs). The concept of sensitivity factors is used in the proposed algorithm for regulating voltages at weak load buses. The optimal sharing of reactive power among EIDGs is formulated as a linear programming problem, which can be solved in a very fast manner for real-time control purpose. The proposed method is validated on a MG test-bed evolved from the IEEE standard 13-bus test feeder."

The system side can be equivalent to the shunt large capacitance in the fault component model. According to this characteristic of the VSC-HVDC system, a novel pilot protection scheme for VSC-HVDC transmission lines based on parameter identification is proposed in this paper. The protection principle can distinguish internal faults from external faults by identifying the capacitance on two terminals with the time-domain algorithm. The capacitance on two terminals can be accurately identified simultaneously when an internal fault occurs, while the capacitance at both ends cannot be accurately identified simultaneously when an external fault occurs. Therefore, a pilot protection criterion is constructed. The simulation results show that the protection scheme can distinguish internal faults from external faults reliably and quickly, and it is not affected by transition resistance, distributed capacitance of lines, and the control mode. In addition, the method can be implemented easily with simple computation and has certain practical value."

In order to reveal the potential merits and demerits of the FSCWs when used in IMs, a conventional slot distributed winding (CSDW) IM having the same rated output values has also been designed and all results obtained from simulation have been compared. The comparison includes detailed machine dimensions, weights, magnetic flux density and line distributions, losses, efficiency, torque-speed curves, torque ripple levels, and also magnitude of forces acting on the stator and rotor windings under the steady-state and fault conditions. All simulations have been built in ANSYS MaxwellÂ® electromagnetic field simulation software based on finite element method. This study will assist in answering lots of the questions raised about the advantages and disadvantages of using FSCWs in the IMs."

The simulation results confirm that the stresses forced on the rotor in the proposed topology are below the yield strength of the material with a safety factor of 1.2. Fatigue life may be an issue and will be investigated in the future. The high speed operation allows for a smaller overall size, which in turn leads to lower manufacturing costs.

The small-signal stability of the system is investigated to identify critical modes associated with different parts of the interconnected AC and DC power systems. The analysis is presented in several steps in order to identify interaction problems and critical modes that can occur with different typical system configurations. Firstly, a case with point-to-point HVDC connection is analysed, followed by the analysis of a four-terminal DC system, before the stability of the entire CigrÃ© DC grid configuration is studied. The state variables participating in critical modes, and the parameter sensitivities of these modes are identified and discussed.

Efficient use of energy and materials and a drastic reduction of greenhouse emissions and noise footprints are the key motivations behind the more electric aircraft. In one of such aircraft electrical systems, the main DC bus is generally kept at 270V and many critical and bidirectional loads require 28V input. Hence, an efficient bidirectional DC-DC converter is required for this purpose. Dual active bridge with HF transformer isolation is one of the best choices for such applications. Another important aspect in avionic systems is to reduce the size and weight of the system. By increasing the DC-DC converter operating frequency the size of the magnetic components can be reduced. However, this is achieved with the increased switching losses and associated cooling requirements. The recent advancements in SiC device technology have helped to improve the switching performance and allowed the operation at higher temperature without degradation of its performance. Simulation and experimental evaluations of 1kW lab-prototype are presented."

These, in turn, can cause EMC issues, unwanted protection trips and other problems. In the present article a dc micro-grid in which the neutral point of the MV/LV transformer is directly grounded and the dc micro-grid is floating (i.e., there is no grounding connection) is analysed. When a ground fault occurs, potentially harmful fault currents flow through the front-end converter, depending on the fault resistance and on the load conditions. The methodology proposed in this work protects the front-end converter while the task of feeding the dc-side loads is committed to storage systems. The calculation of the minimum fault resistance that the front-end converter can tolerate is provided and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is tested by means of numerical simulations."

In addition, the permanent magnets of all the motors have the same dimensions and are made from the same material. The starting and synchronization of the motors is studied under no load, full load, and high inertia. In steady state operation, the performance of the LSIPMSMS fed from sinusoidal is analyzed.

To enhance energy conversion efficiency, bypass diodes have been used in PV systems. The usage of bypass diodes is particularly effective when a PV system is under an uneven shading condition. However, shading is normally applied to a PV array in very random manners, making shading analysis and improvement contributed by the bypass diodes extremely hard to access. This paper performs a comprehensive study on the PV array energy extraction characteristics under a variety of shading conditions. Based on the study, an enhanced bypass diode design in terms of doping concentration is proposed. Investigation of the proposed bypass diode scheme shows that such bypass diode design is effective in improving energy capture efficiency under diverse shading conditions. Significant simulation studies are conducted for detailed evaluation of a PV system with the different bypass diode schemes and process."

The cyber network is categorized as a digital communication network, so it intrinsically follows similar regulations, as well as faults and failures. A data communication system is a chain of components stretching from a data source to its destination. Like a chain, each component must accomplish its assigned tasks adequately. Nevertheless, this novel technology has introduced new groups of failures that are conceptually different from those of traditional power networks. Power system reliability studies must consider the failure modes and repair strategies of the cyber network. This paper investigates cyber-power network failures and proposes a novel, all-inclusive categorization of failures that have the potential to threaten the power system's proper operation. Microgrids and automated substations are two well-known cyber-power networks that could benefit from the proposed study."

This paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the reliability of an all-digital substation considering different topologies of both the station and process buses. The proposed reliability evaluation procedure is based on analytical Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) approach and stochastic Monte Carlo simulation method. This reliability analysis, combined with sensitive analysis, would help indicate the most reliable Substation Communication Network (SCN) architecture to realize a specific communication service. It would also help determine the weak points needed to be improved in order to improve the overall reliability of the automation system."

The duty cycle is predicted using the model of the IM, whereas analytical calculations are used in all of the prior duty cycle control methods. To minimize both torque and flux ripples, two different cost functions are used: one for voltage vector selection and another one for duty cycle prediction. Since the selection of the cost function in MPC is not a straightforward task, the proposed control strategy reduces the dependency on the selection of cost function while minimizing torque and flux ripples significantly. The commutation frequency of inverter is also reduced. Simulation results have revealed that, the proposed controller reduces the torque ripple and average switching frequency by 56% and 21%, respectively while keeping the flux performance."

This can be accomplished by charging the storage during off-peak time periods, when electricity energy prices are low, and discharging it during times when on-peak energy prices are applied. This article addresses the question whether it is economically viable to install medium-scale distributed storage devices in the power system designed to lower the electricity cost for a customer-side application, assuming flexible electricity tariffs. The technical/economical evaluation is carried out referring to Lithium ion (Li-ion), Sodium Sulphur (NaS) and Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) technologies, performing a parametric analysis by changing the capital cost of the batteries and the difference between the maximum and minimum electricity price. A case study is performed to show the advantages/disadvantages of the proposed approach."

Many of these games require the player to swap items in order to form matches of three and are collectively known as tile-matching match-three games. Among these, the most influential one is arguably Bejeweled in which the matched items (gems) pop and the above gems fall in their place. Bejeweled has been ported to many different platforms and influenced an incredible number of similar games. Very recently one of them, named Candy Crush Saga enjoyed a huge popularity and quickly went viral on social networks. We generalize this kind of games by only parameterizing the size of the board, while all the other elements (such as the rules or the number of gems) remain unchanged. Then, we prove that answering many natural questions regarding such games is actually NP-Hard. These questions include determining if the player can reach a certain score, play for a certain number of turns, and others. We also provide a playable web-based implementation of our reduction, which is accessible at http://candycrush.isnphard.com."

The probability distribution function of the received waves is derived in these cases. The bit error rates of the communication are derived by using the proposed method for synchronous and delay detections. The numerical results of the bit error rates indicate that the polarization rotating wave improve communication quality in multipath environment without line-of-sight waves."

Firstly, the new machine concept and the iron loss model derived from Bertotti's formula are introduced, which subdivides the total iron losses into 3 components: hysteresis losses, eddy current losses and excess losses. The coefficients of the iron loss model are estimated from the measurement data of iron loss at various frequencies and different levels of magnetisation using a curve fitting method. The real waveform of flux density is far from sinusoidal, which is assumed in the Bertotti's formula. Besides, the distribution of flux density in each element is completely different. In order to solve the problems, the Fourier transformation of flux density waveform in each finite element is performed, which requires the complete waveform for a whole electrical period. The total iron loss in the motor is determined as the sum of the iron loss in each element. In order to reduce the computation time, the determination of complete flux density waveform from analysis over one-sixth electrical period is researched. Moreover, for the further reduction of the calculation time the replacing of transient analysis with stationary analysis is also investigated. Finally, the results of iron losses founded on the transient and stationary analysis are compared."

Using this method it is then shown how the critical time may be extended by way of optimization of passive system components. In order to perform this optimization a new post-fault (when the converter gating signals are inhibited) model of the Modular Multi-Level (MMC) converter is introduced which drastically reduces simulation time, allowing high resolution parameter sweeps to be performed. The model is validated and is shown to produce fault characteristics similar to that of a conventional switched model."

Many studies investigate the revenue which could be achieved through arbitrage assuming perfect foresight of electricity prices. In practice, storage operators will not have perfect foresight and will have to devise operational strategies using price forecasts. This paper investigates the impact of forecast accuracy on the optimality of storage revenue. The optimal revenue available is determined using linear programming and historic electricity prices. The results are compared to those found using dynamic programming and electricity price forecasts with increasing percentage error. A small scale lithium ion battery and a large pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) device are compared. The results show that revenue reduces at an increasing rate with increasing forecast error. The PHES device is more sensitive to forecast accuracy than the lithium ion battery. For both technologies, with a maximum error of 30%, 80% of the optimal revenue can be achieved. With increased capacity and significantly increased power rating, the lithium ion battery becomes more sensitive to price forecast accuracy."

Due to their low-cost and ease of implementation, hill climbing (HC) MPPT methods based on the perturbation principles are most commonly used to extract the maximum power (MP). However, the efficiency of these methods are highly influenced by the continued oscillation around the maximum power point. In order to circumvent the problem of continued oscillations and increase efficiency in steady-state and dynamic conditions a modified MPPT algorithm is proposed. The algorithm is simulated in Simulink/Matlab and validated with an experimental. Results from the experiment indicate higher efficiency and better performance in both steady-state and dynamic conditions."

Network code constraints on the reactive power exchanged with the bulk power system are also considered. Successful application to a hypothetical 199 km long, 400 kV-50 Hz cable system collecting up to 2 GW from several OWFs is presented, showing that the proposed operation ensures at least 97% transmission efficiency at full load, with near-unity generator power factor values. Moreover, possible constraints due to sending end voltage rise at full load suggest the implementation of voltage control at the network connection point."

This feature is essential to provide optimum utilization of solar energy, maximizing the amount of extracted water. Low complexity hardware and control ensure higher reliability and ease of installation and servicing. In the proposed scheme, the PV string is directly connected with the DC-link of a three-phase VSI, driving a PMSM pump with a standard Field Oriented Control (FOC). To achieve fast MPPT, the controller integrates a Sliding-Mode Ripple-Correlation (SMRC) MPPT algorithm, acting on the pump speed reference. The system is therefore capable of operating without the need for additional power conversion stages dedicated to MPPT. Matlab simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and control."

As such, methods of determining whether a âsecurity chipâ contains hardware Trojans are a research concern. This study proposes power relative variation (PRV) parameters to analysis the relation between test vectors and detection sensitivity. Following a brief introduction into Trojans and detection methods, we present the S-box circuit noise model in AES core and simulate the power tracks of various sizes of hardware Trojans using HSPICE. We also apply different sets of test vectors in 40 nm processing. Experimental results show that the power of the entire circuit is reduced by 41% and the PRV value increased 12.71% and 3.34% at most corresponding to combinational and sequential Trojan circuits. The valid test vectors can enhance the activity of hardware Trojans. They can also limit the noise from process, supply voltage, and temperature and extrude the features from the Trojan circuit to increase PRV value. As a result, a sample amount can be compressed at a reduced cost given a similar detection effect. Hence, the investigation into the influence of test vectors on the detection methods of hardware Trojans based on side-channel analysis is extremely important."

By considering a simplified piecewise-linear model of the spur production mechanism, we derive an analytical expression for the scaling of the noise and spur as a function of mismatch.

This way, the grid voltage level improves, and the wind turbine can still generate power under suboptimal grid voltage conditions. The effect on the grid voltage depends on the grid impedance ratio R/X. In this paper, the effectiveness of the grid voltage control is improved by estimating the grid impedance ratio in real-time to inject active and reactive power accordingly.

However, to meet the safety regulations, the leakage current, which deteriorates the power quality and generates EMI of transformerless PV inverter, have to be addressed carefully. In order to eliminate the leakage current, an improved topology based on H5 topology is proposed in this paper. The operation principle, common mode (CM) characteristics, and the impact of junction capacitance of the switches are analyzed in detail. Three-level output voltage has been achieved in the proposed improved inverter by implementing unipolar SPWM with wide input voltage range. Furthermore, the European Union (EU) efficiency is improved by replacing the IGBTs with MOSFETs. The proposed improved inverter topology has been simulated by MATLAB/Simulink software to validate the accuracy of the theoretical explanations. Finally, a 1kw prototype has been built and tested. Experimental results show 98.2% maximum efficiency and 97.76% EU efficiency on the 1kw prototype circuit with 16 kHz switching frequency."

The effectiveness of this simple assessment is measured by comparing it to a condition evaluation that is based on detailed, quantitative laboratory testing.

Most often, broken rotor bar frequency components are hardly detected in the stator current due to its low magnitude and its closeness to the supply frequency component. To overcome this drawback, the PSWT is applied to filter out the fundamental frequency. In order to optimize the cost and the computation time of the diagnosis system, PSWT is implemented under lower sampling rate. MWSVM is developed to perform the faults recognition. Different binary Multiclass SVM strategies are compared with various wavelet kernel functions in terms of classification accuracy, training and testing complexity. The experimental results show that the Directed Acyclic Graph SVM (DAG) gives the best classification accuracy of 99%."

To tackle the problem caused by the distributed capacitance in the transmission line, the observing point is moved to the setting point from the relay point by using the Bergeron equations to improve the accuracy of measurement when a fault occurs around the remote terminal. Meanwhile, to tackle the problem of low fault resistance tolerance ability by traditional distance relays especially for phase-ground faults, a new distance protection algorithm concerning the impact of the fault resistance and the opposite system is proposed at the observing point using the information extracted by matrix pencil algorithm. At last, data from PSCAD simulation software demonstrate that the proposed distance protection algorithm can trip the breaker correctly for an internal fault even with high fault resistance and will not overreach for an external fault."

Filter components may be smaller. Also, devices can be combined to give a blocking capability higher than their individual ratings. For example, where a vehicle's battery pack is being charged from or discharged into a 400V three-phase supply, SJ MOSFETs rated at 600V can be deployed in a three-level topology to give a nominal 1200V blocking capability.

Due to the fact that the farming village is rich with natural resources that can be tapped for captive energy generation, UNMC has developed a central cabin system that can be expanded to control Solar PV system but also other potential renewable energy system such as Mini Hydro, Tidal and even Wind. This paper only focuses on the initial Solar Photovoltaic aspect. . The system was tested with varying loads and results show that the system has the capability to supply sufficient power to rural homes. It is envisaged that this central control unit will be further developed and tested with other renewable energy systems, hence reducing reliance on conventional fossil based generated electricity."

The suggested algorithm provides good protection sensitivity and very secure discrimination between faulty and healthy feeders even in the most challenging faults with highly distorted signals such as restriking earth faults. The operation of the novel method is based on multifrequency neutral admittance measurement in combination with cumulative phasor summing technique. In the paper, first the theory and operation of the novel algorithm is described. Secondly, the advantages and features brought by the novel method are demonstrated with variety of different fault types. The results show that the novel algorithm provides universal, all-in-one protection function that detects selectively all types of earth faults. Also the overall security and dependability of the existing protection schemes can be improved by the novel method, which can be applied either in tripping or alarming mode depending on the application."

        "abstract": "The resonant harmonic elimination PWM (RHEPWM) method is brought to mitigate resonant harmonics in the harmonic source of an autotransformer (AT) fed electrified railway in order to suppress high-risk resonances (HRRs). Firstly, the coupling model consisting of a traction power supply network (TPSN) and a traction drive unit (TDU) of a high-speed train is established, and the HRR mechanism which indicates that the composite pulse voltage of the multiple four-quadrant converters in the TDU is the harmonic source is analysed based on it. Then the RHEPWM technology applied into the multiple converters is described thoroughly, and the target functions and initial commutating angles are decided based on the conventional carrier-shifting based sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (CSBSPWM). Subsequently, the optimal commutating angles are obtained by the rolling Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method. Finally, the combined simulation model consisting of an AT fed TPSN and a TDU is implemented in a RT-Lab simulator, and the performance comparison between CSBSPWM and RHEPWM is carried out through the time-domain simulation. The results verify that RHEPWM not only has the capacity to suppress HRR, but also improves the total power factor and mitigates the distortion in the load current."

Filters are widely used in such situation to maintain a good state of power quality. Lots of research has been carried out to propose filter design methodology.

Typically, DC traction networks are supplied by the AC grid by means of an uncontrolled diode bridge rectifier. In case of a low-impedance short circuit fault between catenary and rail, the fault current reaches a large value. For densely meshed networks the mechanical circuit breakers can become too slow. The methods studied are applying fault current limiters, faster interruption of fault currents and adding controlled rectifiers. The fault current limiters considered are a reactor and a superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL). For faster interruption of fault currents, a hybrid circuit breaker is investigated. Simulations show that the short circuit current can be limited considerably by installing limitation devices after the rectifiers, when the short circuit occurs close to a substation. Fast interruption of the fault or application of the SFCL results in the strongest reduction of the short circuit current."

In traditional hybrid vehicles, this is important in designing for optimal fuel consumption; in plug-in hybrids and pure electric vehicles, it is critical for accurate prediction of range, a key market qualifier. There are a variety of techniques, typically operating at different levels of fidelity and employing different modelling philosophies. This paper develops on earlier work, exploring conventional and `backward' techniques in the context of current NEDC-based UNECE vehicle testing standards and the proposed replacements based on the World Light Test Procedure. Model sensitivities for A, C and D-segment vehicles are quantified and this is used to explore aspects where accurate models are key and where lower-fidelity representative models are appropriate. The paper also explores the sensitivity of predictions to `PID control' driver models, and discusses the effect of cycle-following tolerance on predictions. Finally, the paper proposes new standards - suitable for simulation or real-world testing - for a common quantification of in-use battery lifetime. The use of these techniques and the sensitivity analysis methods on a representative simulation model is demonstrated as a case study, and the impacts on battery management strategy design are explored."

IEEE Standard C37.118-2005 introduced measurement accuracy under steady state conditions as well as interference rejection. In 2009, the IEEE started a joint project with IEC to harmonize real time communications in IEEE Standard C37.118-2005 with the IEC 61850 communication standard. These efforts led to the need to split the C37.118 into 2 different standards: IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 that now includes performance of synchrophasors under dynamic systems conditions; and IEEE Standard C37.118.2-2011 Synchrophasor Data Transfer for Power Systems, the object of this paper."

It is however well known that battery lifetime depends on many parameters, such as power density, specific power, energy density, operating environment, etc., so that an accurate methods to analyze this dependence, also taking into account the randomness of the above parameters in real operating conditions, is a necessary even if difficult task. In this framework, in the paper, after a thorough statistical data analysis, a probabilistic method for battery design is proposed which ensures the optimization of a suitable cost function which has the expected lifetime as a basic input. The method takes properly into account, in particular, the random variations in specific power experienced by a lead-acid battery. The statistical features of lifetime are also explored by means of a large series of numerical simulations based upon suitable probability distributions which may characterize the above operating conditions, in order to obtain an efficient estimation of the above lifetime distribution."

To assure and provide a flexible and a system compatible integration of those decentralized energy resources, power electronic inverters as grid interfaces between energy conversion systems (ECS) and the main grid getting more important. Hence, the inverter has to join the grid operation functions, e.g. frequency and voltage stabilization, similar to the conventional power plants. By implementation of a new control approach based on symmetrical components, the control speed at asymmetrical load and grid conditions is improved. The control approach is verified in a FPGA based smart grid inverter platform, confirming the potential at a hardware system. When using fast control functions for asymmetrical grid conditions it is possible to guarantee stability of future smart grids at rising penetration of distributed energy resources to the main grid."

The method uses the ripple current generated by the inverter itself as a means to detect inter-turn fault. High frequency impedance behaviours of healthy and faulted windings are analysed and modelled, and ripple current signature due to inter-turn faults is quantified. A simple analogue circuit is designed to extract the PWM ripple current via an RMS band-pass filter and the filtered RMS current is used for fault detection. In addition, the method also identifies the faulted phase. The method is tested in simulation on a five phase alternate slot wound SPM machine."

        "abstract": "The majority of Blade Tip Timing (BTT) acquisition and analysis systems require a once per revolution (OPR) timing reference that is vibration free and reliable throughout the whole speed range of the rotor under investigation. Typically this consists of a probe and a target mounted somewhere close to the rotor centre line. In many applications the installation of the OPR sensor is expensive, and in the case of turbines, in a non-optimal position due to access and environmental constraints. OPR systems are usually duplicated for redundancy and failure rates are high. The loss of the OPR signal usually results in the loss of all analysis capability for a BTT application. Numerous attempts have been made to derive the OPR signal from the blade arrival time, however, the blades themselves undergo vibration (the exact same phenomena that we are trying to identify and quantify) leading to significant uncertainties in the resulting analysis. This presentation details an analytical method for reproducing the reference time for each revolution from one or many blade arrival time sensors without the need for a separate measurement channel. Validation will be presented for a number of real engine data sets covering a range of blade sizes and engine speeds. Utilising this method allows the elimination of the OPR measurement system and opens up the opportunity to reanalyse previously obtained data where the OPR system may have been compromised during the test. In a flight EHM system where weight and performance are critical the elimination of the OPR system is highly desirable."

Microgrid technologies have the potential to address some of the challenges associated with improving the resiliency of the nations electrical infrastructure.

This paper aims to investigate the best solution for optimal operation of distribution networks by taking into consideration of DG. The optimal allocation of DG can be considered as an integer problem that can be formulated by metaheuristic methods. In this paper, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used to solve the DG placement and sizing. The IEEE 34 bus test system has been utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSO algorithm on herein mentioned problem.

In this paper for eliminating these problems, a new method based on conventional droop method is presented. This new method uses absolute value of current signal only and replacing LPF by a DC Mean Block. To compare two methods, a system with two parallel inverters is simulated in MATLAB. Comparison between Results of two methods shows effectiveness of proposed method in improvement of VSIs' behavior in transient response."

In order to solve these issues, H7 inverter with modified discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (MDPWM) is proposed recently. The leakage current is reduced without sacrificing the performance of the PV inverter. In this paper, a simple three-phase inverter topology with corresponding modulation technique is proposed. It is proven that the leakage current is reduced to comply with the standard requirement without sacrificing the performance of the PV inverter.

The dataset derives from real measured acquisitions of distribution lines feeding residential and commercial users. The mathematical approach is based on both the Wavelet Analysis (WA) and the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) in order to select and isolate the different operation modes of the distribution line. Numerical results highlight that PV plants strongly affect the time-domain power signal. As this signal is typically non stationary and nonlinear, the HHT-based approach allows to fix power disturbances and anomalies."

However, due to the number of machine parameters, with some tightly `coupled' with each other, optimisation of the design could become extremely challenging by conventional analytical means. Here, the particle swarm optimization method is used in the design of an axial flux permanent magnet generator for small-scale wind power system. Five inter-dependent design parameters are adjusted simultaneously to achieve an optimal solution for the application. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is employed to evaluate the electromagnetic performance for the optimization. The results show the proposed optimization method is efficient and with fast convergence."

To save network energy, nodes schedule is applied to set the redundant nodes to sleep state while the non-redundant nodes remain active state. This paper proposes an Energy Saving Sleep Scheduling algorithm (EPSS). First, unequal clustering is executed for the entire wireless sensor networks, and Cluster Head(CH) are selected by considering node residual energy and the distance between nodes. Then, cluster head implenments sleeping schedule in cluster. The sleeping probability of each node is decided by the node density in its own cluster and the distance between node and CH. The simulation results shows that the proposed algorithm can reduce energy consumption and prolong the lifecycle of network."

The implemented EKF algorithm simultaneously estimates stator currents (1sÎ± and 1sÎ²), stator fluxes (Î¨sÎ± and Î¨sÎ²), rotor angular velocity (wm), and load torque (tL) by assuming that stator voltages and currents are available. The HIL system also includes stator currents and fluxes based IM model which provides actual stator currents to the EKF algorithm and is also utilized to validate the flux, speed and load torque estimations of the implemented EKF algorithm. Virtex-5 VSX110T FPGA evolution board is used for this real-time application. The FPGA board is programmed via Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) in order to develop both IM model and the EKF algorithm. ISE Design Suit Interface is used as debugger and compiler. The results obtained from the EKF and IM model developed on FPGA are graphically compared to verify the sufficiency of estimation performance of the EKF algorithm and demonstrate that EKF algorithm is implemented successfully with less computational time (less sampling time for each recursive operation) due to the inherent parallel signal processing ability of FPGA."

The proposed technique uses rate of change of frequency, rate of change of voltage, rate of change of active power, and rate of change of reactive power as the ANN inputs. The appropriate data base of various islanding and non islanding cases is created for training the ANN.

Most PV units are connected to the distribution or transmission grid by voltage source converters (VSC). As the number and size of grid-connected PV units increase, the requirements placed on them by grid operators are changing. Among the new requirements by some grid codes is that PV units should help with voltage support by reactive power compensation. One significant advantage of a grid connected PV system capable of reactive power compensation is that it can operate during the night as a reactive power compensator. This paper presents the control of a grid-connected PV system with reactive power compensation using Direct Power Control with Space Vector Modulation (DPC-SVM). Simulation results for both daytime and night-time operation are presented. The results show good dynamic and steady-state performance, decoupled control of active and reactive power, low distortion in the output voltage and current, and constant switching frequency over a wide range of conditions."

        "abstract": "Induction heating is a well-known technique to produce very high temperature at reduced time for well specific applications such as in melting steel, brazing, and hardening. Series resonant converter proves to suit better to surface metals treatment and hardening. Efficiency reaches its highest level in the resonant mode, where switching losses are minimized by operating the IGBT at a resonant frequency for switching at the zero crossing point of current or voltage. However, as heat rises during hardening metal process, the metal exhibits parameter variations, which ultimately affects the overall system performances. Therefore, the inverter system with an effective load-adaptive control circuit with short response time is highly sought to let the system operate efficiently regardless of any variation of the load parameters. This will bring back the system under resonant mode to allow the system to operate at its optimal performances. In this paper, an analysis of a series resonant inverter performance is conducted, in which the control frequency is monitored and continuously adapted using phase-locked loop aimed to metal hardening. The control technique is characterized by its flexibility, low cost hardware, and short response time. The system comprises analogue and digital circuits, microcontroller based. The experimental bench is built for the purpose in the range of 1 to 5 kW power, with 01 to 50 kHz operating frequency. First, the process principle and the design procedure of the inverter system with the proposed control scheme are described through modelling and simulation. Then, experimental results are presented to show the validity of this technique, and to evaluate the system performances."

The proposed method computes the dq-axis current references online instead of employing predefined look-up tables (LUT) as in the conventional schemes. Thus, it provides the flexibility for online parameter update or estimation to enhance the drive system efficiency. It is shown that in the FB-based FW operation where the machine voltage magnitude is maintained at the voltage hexagon boundary via the voltage FB loop using the ideal FB voltage references which the nonlinear inverter characteristics are neglected, the stator flux reference regulated via the voltage FB loop may not be optimally controlled due to the mismatch between the ideal demand and actual voltages applied to the IPM BLAC machine. For a given torque, it results in a higher current magnitude than the ideal demand, and therefore leads to extra copper losses. To solve this problem, a nonlinear inverter compensation (NIC) method is proposed and experimentally validated by measurements on a 10kW IPM BLAC drive. It is shown that by incorporating the proposed NIC technique, the achievable torque under a given speed can be increased up to 4% and the copper losses under a torque demand and given speed can be reduced up to 4% in the FW operation region."

Then, theoretical lightning protection measure is selected by comprehensively considering constrained factors according to the IAHP weights.

The scheme utilizes on-line measurements of voltages and currents, as well as line material parameters and weather data to apply a thermal on-line forecast. Thus, it is possible to estimate the remaining withstand time of all concerned overloaded lines. Therewith, suitable countermeasures and the optimal time for their execution can be determined. For the proof of concept, a detailed modeling concept of the thermal behavior of overhead lines in grid operation is performed in dynamic power system simulations."

The data redundancy caused by the overmuch attributes in defects data set will make the prediction accuracy decrease. A model based on locally linear embedding and support vector machine (LLE-SVM) is proposed to solve this problem in this paper. The SVM is used as the basic classifier in the model. And the LLE algorithm is used to solve data redundancy due to its ability of maintaining local geometry. The parameters in SVM are optimized by the method of ten-fold cross validation and grid search. The comparison between LLE-SVM model and SVM model was experimentally verified on the same NASA defect data set. The results indicate that the proposal LLE-SVM model performs better than SVM model, and it is available to avoid the accuracy decrease caused by the data redundancy."

For that reason, in cases where the power transfer contains a high degree of fluctuation such produced by a wind farm, power losses will be much higher than with same average power transferred smoothly. For this reason, the use of energy storage in power systems reduces transmission line losses and hence can improve the overall efficiency of the system if the energy storage losses are smaller. This paper investigates the potential to improve the overall efficiency by developing an analytical model for the energy storage and the transmission line losses depending on disturbance and confirms it via PSCAD/EMTDC simulation for idealised and real wind profile data."

The relays based on fault component are widely used in transmission line protection, which makes it essentially important to study the adaptability of fault component protection. The adaptability of fault component protection to wind farm integration system is studied in this paper. Fault component protection works well only when the system impedance is stable or the positive and negative sequence system impedances are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis, PSCAD simulation and fault record data show that the positive sequence impedance at wind farm side has large fluctuations and obvious difference from the negative sequence impedance. This significantly reduces the reliability of the relays based on fault component in wind farm integration system."

The identification principle is based on the different variation trends of voltage in the cases of disturbance and fault, and this characteristic difference of voltage will be amplified in the IMF with the lowest frequency band by decomposing the voltage fault component using EMD. Thus, integration value of the selected IMF is employed as the criterion for distinguishing disturbance from fault. A Â±500kV HVDC system simulation model, including detailed lightning stroke simulation model, is built in PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results show that the proposed disturbance identification method can distinguish disturbances from faults correctly with ultra-high-speed, providing a strong guarantee for main protection to prevent the mal-operation in the case of disturbance."
