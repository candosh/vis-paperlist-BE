Both filters are single-sensor filters. Since their multisensor generalizations are computationally intractable, a further approximation - iterating their corrector equations, once for each sensor - has been used instead. This approach is theoretically unpleasing because it is not invariant under reordering of the sensors, and because it is implicitly based on strong simplifying assumptions. The purpose of this paper is to derive multisensor PHD and CPHD filters that (1) are invariant under sensor reordering, (2) require much weaker simplifying assumptions, and (3) are potentially computationally tractable (at least in the case of the multisensor CPHD filter)."

To facilitate CID, we utilize the concept of conceptual spaces to represent cooperative and non-cooperative CID. The Choquet integral combined with Bayes risk enables methods that provide a statistical approach to adversary intent prediction through the CID knowledge spaces. The use of the Choquet Integral for CID is applied in the context of a Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) example."

It is also well understood that the image measurements used to estimate the 3-D state are inherently noisy. Despite the wealth of research in this area, the accurate statistical characterisation of the uncertainty for any 3D state estimation from stereo algorithm is less well understood. This paper presents the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for 3-dimensional state estimation from a rectified stereo pair of cameras. The paper also presents a method for efficient stereo estimation via Bayesian triangulation that achieves the CRLB. These results provide a basis for 3D statistical estimation for camera-based sensor measurements."

To benefit from CoMP by interference mitigation, UEs have to be served user centric to really leverage potential performance gains like increased capacity or spectral efficiency. This leads to a severe challenge how to assign user groups (UG) to cooperation areas (CA) in a user centric way because UGs must be found with an unique set of strongest cells. Here the so called partial CoMP concept is proposed and analyzed, which allows to serve up to 90% of all UEs in a user centric manner by their 3 strongest cells. The main achievement is to reach the significant performance gains of user centric cooperation for a practical and easy to realize system."

We then attempt to find solutions to this problem using the IEEE 118-bus and the RTS 96 system test cases. The IEEE 118-bus test case is analyzed at varying load levels. Using simple heuristics, we demonstrate that these networks can be operated to satisfy N-1 standards while cutting costs by incorporating transmission switching into the dispatch. In some cases, the percent savings from transmission switching was higher with an N-1 DCOPF formulation than with a DCOPF formulation."

A degree of consistency (and implicitly a degree of inconsistency) of a decision-making problem are defined. α-D MCDM is generalized to a set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of linear and/or nonlinear homogeneous and/or non-homogeneous equations and/or inequalities. Consistent, weak consistent, and strong consistent examples are presented in the sequel for linear and non-linear decision making problems."

Although the CPHD filter has better target detection and tracking performance than the PHD filter, its cubic complexity in m will limit its practicality in many applications. The primary purpose of this paper is to derive a CPHD filter that, because of a simplified clutter model, has computational complexity O(mn).

Finally 6 kind of shading schemes composed of different shading devices were applied in these two buildings and the heating, cooling and total building energy savings were simulated.

It is assumed that the moving targets try to avoid the camera field of view of the aircraft by changing their velocities and/or hiding behind buildings. The number of aircraft is much smaller than the number of targets, in general. In order to track as many targets as possible, firstly the targets are grouped into a number of subgroups by maximising the modularity, which is solved efficiently by the power iteration. Secondly, circular optimal paths are assigned to maximise the visibility of the area, given shapes and locations of the ground obstacles, where the computational complexity is reduced using a novel random sampling method. Finally, the aircraft transition paths from the current positions to the desired path are obtained by solving a discrete minimum weighted path length problem."

Therefore, this article discusses the theory of using RBF neural network to identify control object, providing received Jacobian message to BP network, then using arbitrary nonlinear expression ability of BP neural network to achieve the optimum combination of PID control parameters through studying the system, and finally reaching the goal of speedy and stable control. Meanwhile, simulation comparison is made to traditional PID controller on MATLAB and Simulink, and the result shows that the PID controller based on neural networks is faster in response and better in follow nature than the traditional PID controller is."

Photovoltaic modules must withstand 0-100% humidity at -20°C to 100°C with voltages up to 1000 V and thousands of thermal cycles. Therefore, predicting lifetime is no better than predicting the weather. Yet lifetime estimates directly impact the levelized cost of a power generation system and therefore must be quantified. This talk will outline many of the failure modes for solar panels and the failure analysis techniques that are commonly used. Thermal and emission images are the dominate method for identifying egradation in a solar module."

As no hard tooling or external forces is needed during, laser tube bending is a flexible forming process and has potential to deal with materials difficult to bend or thin wall tubes. A formula for bending angle is proposed based on plastic mechanics and verified by experiment. It can be seen that the bending angle is as a result of laser power, laser scanning speed, tube dimension and material properties. For multi pass bending, the bending angle increases with the laser irradiation number but not linearly. The maximum value of laser power, with which the laser will melt the metal during bending, and the minimum, with which the laser can not induces plastic bending, are also proposed."

We studied the transport mechanism of light in dense suspended sediment water body by the aid of numerical simulation. The T-Matrix method (TMM) and the Invariant Imbedding Methods was selected as basic methods of numerical simulation. Two formulas was applied in the simulation. The first one described the relation between volume scattering phase function and Stokes matrix. The other one shows the relation between albedo and scattering section. These formulas connect the T-Matrix Method and the Invariant Imbedding Methods and put them work together for simulating the mechanism of light transfer in suspended sediment water body. The results of numerical simulation coincide with in-stitu data. We found the monotone relations between the physical parameters of suspended sediment and the spectrum of remote-sensing reflectance. The monotone relations mean that retrieving physical property from spectrum is feasible."

In particular, parsimony is conceptually simple and amenable to rigorous treatment, and has a clear analogue in graph theory, the Steiner tree. We present and refine the notion of sequence space as the soil from which all graph-theoretical methods arise, studying its structural properties and complexity with an eye on maximum parsimony. We therefrom introduce a basic set of very efficient implicit reductions that discard information with a fixed effect on the optimality of the solution, and show how it can be applied to large, real datasets."

Due to the existing multi-objective optimization problems of AGAP have paid no attention to push-out conflict avoidance, flight push-out conflict is considered as a safety restriction in this paper, and a multi-objective optimization model with push-out avoidance is established. The numerical examples solved by genetic algorithm show the validity of improving both safety and efficiency by comparing our approach to that one without safety restrict."

When one of the antenna channel gains is much higher than the other antenna channel gains; using antenna selection method increases received SNR at the receiver. However, when antenna channel gains are close to each other; using code selection method increases the received SNR at the receiver. In this paper, we propose an adaptive code and antenna selection scheme to increase the received SNR at the destination. In this technique, using one additional bit feedback yields improved SNR at the destination compared to using solely code or transmit antenna selection method. Detailed simulations show that adaptive code and antenna selection with four bit feedback yields a performance of the extended balanced space-time block coding with ideal feedback which requires exact channel state information at the transmitter."

This phenomenon can be explained with equivalent magnetic current distributions in the slots. The new mechanism of artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) in waveguides thus is established."

This estimation cannot be efficiently performed for nonlinear non-Gaussian systems because of the complex representation of the state density. To alleviate this complexity, approximation techniques based on Gaussian mixtures are used. An adaptive mixture approximation method is used based on optimal minimization of a least squares error function between the true density and the corresponding approximation mixture. The state Gaussian mixture is propagated over time through prediction and update steps. Results in comparison with other methods show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."

The purpose of this work is to introduce a novel domain to the tracking community, and novel techniques to network science. Group tracking is formulated here as a traditional, continuous-time Bayesian filter, which operates on time-evolving network data and outputs joint group membership probabilities over all nodes. Simple measurement and update models are proposed, which enable the derivation of an exact filter. This filter requires an exponentially large state space, however, so it is marginalized to a smaller space. The resulting system tracks second-order statistics (i.e., probabilities of pairs of nodes being in the same group) using equations involving third- and fourth-order statistics, which require closure assumptions. Several closures are investigated, and their merits and drawbacks are discussed."

Then the attributes reflecting the line quality most effectively were detected through a CCD camera-based industrial image analysis system. Finally, the line quality for several digital prints were evaluated and analyzed. The results shown that line width, edge raggedness, and edge blurriness in digital prints were highly correlated with not only the direction of the line, but with digital imaging mechanism.

The challenge is to obtain enough information (in the form of images) immediately prior to impact to allow the impact point to be verified. The introduction of a radio data link onto a weapon allows information to be transmitted back to a remote operator, but this data link will have a limited data rate due to finite bandwidth and other operational restrictions. The main problems are that the impact will destroy the seeker and this is very likely to disrupt the transmission of the data back to the operator. Any latency, introduced by pre-processing, compression or encryption of the images, will have a significant effect on the information that can be extracted. This paper shows that low bit-depth images can be fused to reconstruct an image of the weapon's impact point and that noise in the low-bit images increases the information content of the reconstructed images - an example of suprathreshold stochastic resonance."

Thus, a tri-band filter of four-pole quasi-elliptic response can be realized by four resonators only. Also, the design can facilitate the feeding design to meet the required external quality factor at the three bands simultaneously. In terms of low-loss co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology, the cavities are vertically stacked, and the filter size can be miniaturized."

The dynamic response of the transmission towers with unequal legs under the Taft earthquake load has been studied in this thesis. It is provided that High-low legs tower's displacement, velocity and acceleration of control point are smaller than equal tower's. In addition, the magnitude of time-history curve of this two tower models' abutment 1 is bigger than abutment 2 when earthquake waves are inputted from three-direction. The study shows the unequal leg transmission towers should be priority to be used when they were built in the mountain area."

This receiver saves the hardware complexity encountered in conventional chip-level receivers, especially for large number of time chips. In OOK OCDMA, larger number of chips is required in order to improve the error performance or increase the number of users. The presented receiver may require no chip synchronization but symbol or frame synchronization is required. The proposed receiver can be used in tunable optical codes with minimum change in the hardware. However, this receiver has more multiple access interference (MAI) which can be reduced using optical pulse shaping or increasing the spatial separation between focused beams in the AOD. Commercially available AODs can decode OOK OCDMA signals with number of chips Yl as large as one thousand or more. The geometry, design, and operation of an AO OOK OCDMA receiver are introduced, error performance is discussed, and interference analysis is presented."

In this paper, we approach this problem with a optimal feature selection technique using analysis based on statistical techniques to model the complex interactions between genes. The two different types of correlation modelling techniques based on the cross modal factor analysis (CFA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were examined. The subsequent fusion of CCA/CFA features with principal component analysis (PCA) features at feature-level, and at score-level result in significant enhancement in classification accuracy for different data sets corresponding to multiclass microarray gene expression data."

Then the singular value of embedded sub-block is amended, BP network built is applied to the embedment and extraction of watermarking. The algorithm recovers the watermark without any reference to the original image. Experimental results show that the new watermarking method performs well in both imperceptibility and robustness for image processing and attack, especially for geometric distortion."

This paper proposes a mesh segmentation algorithm and an adaptive mesh simplification algorithm, based on quadric error metric of Garland, that can keep the triangle grid local features effectively. The algorithm introduces vertex slope as the weighted value of the basic quadric error metric. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm, not only inherits higher speed and quality of the quadric error metric algorithm, but also overcomes the shortcoming of uniform grid."

Vibration state was described by the vibration acceleration signals. The result showed that the precision of tow models was greater than 98%, prediction error was less than 5%, and the two kinds of gray forecast model were successfully applied in vibration state forecast for electrical submersible pump. The effect of dynamic gray forecast model was better than the GM (1,1) forecast model because that it added the new information, increased the white grade of gray interzone, and had the tracking feature. This gray forecast model is simple, high precision and easily calculated in computer."

        "abstract": "Petri net is applied to potential fault diagnosis and modeling the dynamic behavior of hydraulic systems. The potential fault in hydraulic systems is described as unobservable transition in Petri nets. Consequently a diagnoser is constructed and an algorithm is presented. The problem of fault diagnosis is transformed into solving linear equation and fault can be diagnosed through the firing of observable transitions. An example of actual hydraulic system is proposed to illustrate the validity and the feasibility of this method."

In this paper, the performance of horizontal axis wind turbine and horizontal axis wind turbine with a tip vane by CFD were simulated. After comparing the velocity distribution around wind turbine blade with the tip vane-V(8.8×8) and without the tip vane and combining the velocity vectors figure of the certain location, the change of the velocity distribution around wind turbine blade and the weakening of the vortex around blade tip with the tip vane can be seen. These can further display the power augmentation theory of the wind turbine by the tip vane."

According to errors between the furnace temperature's measured value and the goal value, a fuzzy controller is used to regulate the nature gas flux. Then the number of the flame burner is determined with expert control method. On the other hand, a method of fuzzy rules is applied to control the atmosphere of reheating furnace according to the change of nature gas flux and measured oxygen content. The temperature control system for natural gas furnace has been established in a titanium enterprise, and the results of real-word application proved the effectiveness of this method."

Then this paper analyzes the correlation between crude oil pipe networks' fractal features and crude oil production-consumption upon Z-score data normalization and Pearson's correlation coefficient with the help of the software of SPSS. In sum, the amended results revealed: (1) There is an obvious differentiation of the networks between east and west China in terms of density from the fractal dimensions of weighted length-radius. Meanwhile, the density of networks of northeast, north and east China are relatively higher than northwest and south China. (2) It is primary of crude oil consumption to promote the process of crude oil pipe networks' construction and the Pearson's correlation coefficient between networks fractal features and crude oil consumption is 0.878 (high correlation). On the contrary, the correlation between networks fractal features and crude oil production is so low that the Pearson's correlation coefficient between them only reaches 0.076 (non-correlation). (3) For all the regions, there is such a condition of “high networks density, high crude oil consumption” between east China's networks fractal features and her crude oil consumption. However, here is another condition of “low networks density, low crude oil consumption” between northwest and south China's networks fractal features and her crude oil consumption."
