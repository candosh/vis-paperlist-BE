By applying controlled torques to the reaction wheels the Cubli is able to balance on its corner or edge. This paper presents the development of the Cubli. First, the mechatronic design of the Cubli is presented. Then the multi-body system dynamics are derived. The parameters of the nonlinear system are identified using a frequency domain based approach while the Cubli is balancing on its edge with a nominal controller. Finally, the corner balancing using a linear feedback controller is presented along with experimental results."

Moreover, mobility results in channel gains that vary significantly with time. However, since location and received signal strength are correlated, user mobility patterns can be exploited to predict the data rates they will experience in the future. In this paper, we show that with such predictions, long-term RA plans that span multiple cells can be made. We formulate an optimal Predictive Resource Allocation (PRA) framework for a network of cells as a linear programming problem for three different objectives. Presented numerical results provide a benchmark of the PRA performance in realistic and random user mobility scenarios. Significant network and user satisfaction gains are observed compared to RA schemes that do not utilize any predictions."

However, a general web application crawler that exhaustively explores the states can become mired in limited specific regions of the web application, yielding poor functionality coverage. In this paper, we propose a feedback-directed web application exploration technique to derive test models. While exploring, our approach dynamically measures and applies a combination of code coverage impact, navigational diversity, and structural diversity, to decide a-priori (1) which state should be expanded, and (2) which event should be exercised next to maximize the overall coverage, while minimizing the size of the test model. Our approach is implemented in a tool called FEEDEx. We have empirically evaluated the efficacy of FEEDEx using six web applications. The results show that our technique is successful in yielding higher coverage while reducing the size of the test model, compared to classical exhaustive techniques such as depth-first, breadth-first, and random exploration."

The performances of the proposed cross-layer assisted handoff TCP (TCP-CLAH) are evaluated and compared to those of TCP NewReno (TCP-NR). Our results show that TCP-CLAH outperforms TCP-NR significantly in terms of jitter, round-trip time, and queue size, thereby reducing service disruptions and glitches of ongoing communications substantially during a handoff."

From the perspective of the operators, deployment of the picocell base stations needs to consider minimizing the backhaul cost without degrading the service to users. Multiple picocell base stations can be deployed in areas where signal from the macro base stations does not reach well and backhaul (such as wired or microwave link) links can be established between the picocell base station and the macrocell base station. In case wireless links between picocell base stations are to be established, a careful design is required for both channel allocation and placement of the pico cell base stations. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to analyze the placement of the picocell base stations so that the minimum data rate requirement is guaranteed in the worst-case scenario of interference in the wireless links between the picocell base stations. The model is validated through simulations considering both fading and non-fading channel conditions."

The sensors collect environmental and physiological data with various importance, therefore, the provisioning of quality of service (QoS) for the sensory data in BAN is a critical issue. This paper proposes MM-QoS, which is a multiple level-based QoS design at MAC layer for a tree topology structured BAN. The QoS provisioning is divided into three levels of priorities, i.e., priority of user (PoU), priority of data (PoD) and priority over time (PoT). The time slot-based CSMA/CA mechanism in the beacon enabled mode of IEEE 802.15.4 is utilized for the implementation of the QoS framework. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the multi-level QoS provisioning in BAN."

Computing is being transformed to a model consisting of services that are commoditised and delivered in a manner similar to utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. In such a model, users access services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted. Several computing paradigms have promised to deliver this utility computing vision. Cloud computing is the most recent emerging paradigm promising to turn the vision of \"computing utilities\" into a reality. Cloud computing has emerged as one of the buzzwords in the IT industry. Several IT vendors are promising to offer storage, computation and application hosting services, and provide coverage in several continents, offering Service-Level Agreements (SLA) backed performance and uptime promises for their services. It delivers infrastructure, platform, and software (application) as services, which are made available as subscription-based services in a pay-as-you-go model to consumers. The price that Cloud Service Providers charge can vary with time and the quality of service (QoS) expectations of consumers. This keynote talk will cover (a) 21st century vision of computing and identifies various IT paradigms promising to deliver the vision of computing utilities; (b) the architecture for creating market-oriented Clouds by leveraging technologies such as VMs; (c) market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain SLA-oriented resource allocation; (d) Aneka, a software system for rapid development of Cloud applications and their deployment on private/public Clouds with resource provisioning driven by SLAs and user QoS requirements, (e) experimental results on deploying Cloud applications in engineering, gaming, and health care domains (integrating sensors networks, mobile devices), ISRO satellite image processing on elastic Clouds, and (f) need for convergence of competing IT paradigms for delivering our 21st century vision along with pathways for future research."

        "abstract": "The field of Learning Design now has an interesting challenge. With the prominence of MOOCs and the related field of Learning Analytics, there is an expectation that learning technology will now be able to solve the problem of the worldwide demand for higher education (currently estimated as ~ 100 m per year). This is a problem that all of us in LD recognise and probably share as being the most important to be solved in the field of education. But our approach is different. How will the future development of Learning Design contribute to solving that problem? This paper will consider how the attributes of the field provide the means to do it. They were set out in the Larnaca Declaration: the focus on pedagogy in all its forms, the description of learning designs as computational objects, the sharing of ideas, the scope across all sectors and subject areas, the pedagogic categorisation of learning designs, the attention to what students do in order to learn, the mapping to implementations, the focus on effectiveness. To meet the demand for education we have to provide the level of nurturing and guidance every student needs if they are to attain their learning potential. Given the scale of the demand, this means moving from the current norm of a 1:25 staff student ratio to a much higher ratio, without loss to the student's attainment. At present it is impossible to do this at the high ratio the level of demand requires, but technology is good at solving large-scale challenges. If there is a solution to be found it will come from the teaching community collaborating to design, test, improve and share the pedagogies that achieve high quality student support and attainment on the large scale. To do it, we need all the attributes of Learning Design. So we need a clear consensus of what they are in order to represent them in what we do."

Multi-state models are developed on the basis of Generalized Capacity Outage Tables (GCOTs) to better represent various types of distributed generators in reliability evaluation. Then, the virtual power plant (VPP) is introduced to model microgrids with intermittent sources. Furthermore, the reliability behavior of VPP is efficiently characterized by an equivalent GCOT. The nonsequential Monte Carlo method is then adopted to evaluate the reliability of active distribution systems considering different operation modes under single or multiple contingencies. Some techniques - such as two-step state sampling, zone partitioning and minimal path search - are proposed to facilitate the state evaluation process and improve the Monte Carlo simulation speed. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are validated through extensive numerical tests on an IEEE test system and a real-life active distribution network."

In practice, magnetic resonance and computed tomography images often suffer from anisotropic resolution, so that the image quality is high only within the slices. In this paper we propose a further development of a previously presented super-resolution approach, to reconstruct isotropic high resolution images from only two orthogonal low resolution data sets. Thereby, voxel uncertainties, which arise during image acquisition and preprocessing, are considered. Furthermore, an adapted inpainting method is introduced to ensure a better initial estimation of missing data. Reconstruction quality is also improved, by combining regional and local information. Experiments on synthetic and clinical data sets reveal significant improvement of image quality and accuracy, yielding better results when compared with conventional reconstruction approaches."

In addition, 4G systems such as LTE (Long Term Evolution) can expand cellular coverage and provide higher throughput. New technologies enhance accessibility to the Internet. Migration services from Internet to mobile networks become an important research topic for telecommunications sector. This paper calculates and evaluates system performance by developing a new LTE mechanism for allocating resources in the downlink based on call admission control (CAC) taking into account mobility within and between cellular users. This mechanism uses adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) that divided the geographical area into several concentric regions. With this mechanism each call accepted by the system maintains its initial throughput regardless of the position of the user in the cell."

The specifications for this next generation communication system that will overlay the continental power grids are under intense discussion at this time by organizations like the North-American Synchro-Phasor Initiative (NASPI). In this paper we present a method to simulate, design and test the adequacy of a communication system for a particular transmission grid. The main difference from typical communication system studies is that we formulate the communication requirements from the power grid application requirements, that is, the communication design, simulation and testing is from the viewpoint of the anticipated power applications. Themethod is demonstrated on a WECC 225 bus and a Polish 2383 bus transmission system models."

The role of power electronics and power devices in addressing the challenges in power and energy conversions and storage have continuously been very important and have been given wide attention also due to the fact that energy issues arising from climate change has risen to be a crucial global issue. In power electronic applications, the power density factor related to system designs has improved remarkably in the past two decades. The main contributions in this growth have come from timely development of newer power modules achieved through multi-dimensional major breakthroughs in IGBT and other power chip technologies, packaging structures and functionality integration concepts. Driven by various application needs in the past decades, various generations of power modules have evolved so far and have been widely applied in different power electronics equipment covering industrial motor controls, house-hold appliances, railway traction automotive power-train electronics, windmill and solar power generation systems etc. Today, power devices have become an extremely important component group for its role to sustain growth of power electronics and, thus, to contribute effectively in the current global effort to curb climate change. Under such backgrounds, this presentation is prepared to explain various state-of-the-art power device technologies focusing on IGBT modules and IPMs. It will also include highlights of future technological trends in such fields including prospects of SiC devices. Fig. 1 and 2 provide a summary of the presentation."

Within this framework, we present a reconstruction rule based on softmax regression, where the features of the new classification task are the crisp labels and the reliabilities of dichotomizers' classifications. The approach has been tested on six medical and biological datasets, decomposing the polychotomies via the Error-Correcting Output Code. Its performances favorably compare with those provided by other two well-known reconstruction rules both in terms of global accuracy and accuracy per class."

Technological advances over the past five years have led to an unprecedented level of volume and detail in the acquisition of neuroscientific data relating to the mammalian brain. However, this creates significant challenges in the processing and interpretation of the data. We will adopt a network-centric approach to tackle this, as it matches the physical structure of the brain. We present methods to extract functional brain networks from spatio-temporal time series that describe neural activity, such as in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These networks capture intrinsic brain dynamics. We describe computational methods to extract topological regularities in such networks, including motifs and cycles. We analyze the relations hip between the structure of the network, as represented by its motifs, and its function. For instance, example hub neurons in the hippocampus promote synchrony and shortest loops act as pacemakers of neural activity. We demonstrate the relevance of the network analysis techniques in understanding specific brain-related disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. For instance, the disruption of cortical networks involved in synchronization may be a contributor to autism and schizophrenic patients which have been shown to have higher connectivity within the default mode network."

These new tools may be used for fabrication of MEMS (Micro-ElectroMechanical-System) which integrate microelectronic and micromechanical structures in one system enabling interdisciplinary application. Although MEMS have grown from microelectronics, they are different in technological approach. Using MEMS approach, called microfluidic, small volume of fluid down to less than pico liters can be handled. The scaling of single or multiple lab process down to chip-format known as Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC). Micro and nanoparticles handling can be done using LOC which combines several laboratory functions on a single chip that is only a few millimeters to a few square centimeters in size. MEMS is used to perform chemical analysis by combining laboratory processes on a single chip. The basis for most LOC fabrication processes is photolithography directly derived from microelectronic fabrication. For specific optical characteristics, bio or chemical compatibility, lower production costs and faster prototyping, new processes have been developed such as glass, ceramics and metal etching, deposition and bonding, PDMS process or soft lithography, as well as fast replication methods via electroplating, injection molding and embossing. This talk also discusses several research activities related to the development of LOC conducted at IMEN, UKM Malaysia to handle biological process for medical applications."

A number of projects throughout the neuroscience community have tackled the problem of determining interconnectivity from the nano scale - such as those enabled by laser-scanning light microscopy and semi-automated electron microscopy - to the micro scale of neurons and neuron clusters, to the macro scale of fMRI. The amount of data required to map out the macro scale is in the manageable multi-terabyte range, and largely exists today, while gathering one milometer cubed of synaptic-level data already approaches the multi-petabyte scale and is a few years away. Between these two extremes most likely lies the fastest and most representative path to a useful map of human neuronal connectivity. Although extremely informative on may topics concerning neuronal connectivity, the of the main limitations of the smaller scale approaches are 1) the considerable amount of time and energy needed to have one sample which will likely not be widely representative of a typical human brain and 2) their highly invasive or destructive nature renders them poorly adaptable to living humans."

        "abstract": "We propose a broadcast method for Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) to achieve small latency for message diffusion in a congested situation. In the existing DTN broadcast methods, nodes tend to transfer a limited variant of messages to the contacted nodes, and thus cause an inefficient bandwidth use. That leads to a large latency of message diffusion. This paper proposes a new transfer message selection method called ESF (Estimated Slowest First) which estimates the diffusion rate of messages and precedes the message that has the smallest diffusion rate for its elapsed time from creation, i.e. the slowest message, at the time of node contact. By preceding the slowest message, a variant of the transferred messages is diversified in congested situations and the latency is reduced. The simulation results show that our method can reduce the latency of diffusion completion by 46% more than existing methods in a DTN in a congested situation."

For completeness the talk will also present Nor Flash as well as the roles for Nand and Nor Flash. The second part of the talk will be focused on issues related to reliability and endurance, and current solutions and future challenges. Despite the advantages, NAND-based storage systems are not without challenges. For the next decade, Flash storage systems are expected to provide solutions with reduced product costs, further improved read/write performance at low power consumption, as well as better data integrity for the users. Growth in storage demand is phenomenal, which leads to the adoption of more aggressive technology to keep cost reasonable. This further leads to using smaller cells (~10nm in geometry), as well as more bits/cell to improve storage density, as well as cost. Newer physical storage media requires closer system-level interaction to make the system feasible for reliable data storage solution. State-of-the-art error correcting coding (ECC) solution, as well as advanced memory signal processing (MSP) techniques, will be deployed to make future flash media reliable for all data storage customers. In addition, new system solutions will provide the NAND-based storage system longer endurance and better data retention. The talk will conclude with a discussion of challenges that require significant research."

        "abstract": "In this work, the influence of Ar/O2 ratio during InGaZnO (IGZO) deposition on the electrical characteristics of a-IGZO thin-film transistor (TFT) with HfLaO gate dielectric has been investigated. It is found that lowering the oxygen concentration in the a-IGZO sputtering ambient can effectively improve the device performance, including carrier mobility (μsat), threshold voltage (Vth), sub-threshold slope (SS) and on-off current ratio (Ion/Ioff). Moreover, the hysteresis (ΔVH) of the transfer characteristics of the device under forward and reverse sweepings of gate bias voltage can be suppressed, and improvement on its low-frequency noise properties has been found for lower oxygen concentration in the sputtering ambient. As a result, a high saturation mobility of 12.5 cm2/Vs, a low sub-threshold slope of 0.260 V/dec and a small Hooge's parameter (αH) of 0.4 have been achieved for the sample with an Ar/O2 ratio of 24 sccm/1 sccm. All these improvements can be ascribed to the fact that more oxygen vacancies exist in the a-IGZO film deposited in an ambient with less oxygen. These positively-charged oxygen vacancies can induce a higher electron concentration in the a-IGZO film and thus fill up more electron traps at the interface between a-IGZO and HtLaO."

To address this problem, researchers have recently developed a CSMA/CA-based MAC protocol that supports concurrent transmissions from different transmitters. In this paper we propose an analytical model to investigate the throughput performance of this CSMA/CA-based MAC protocol operating in a MU-MIMO WLAN. Comparisons with simulation results show that our analytical model provides a close estimation of the network throughput. Based on this model, we analyze the throughput performance with respect to different network parameters. Specifically, we show that: 1) the optimal backoff window sizes can be designed to achieve the maximum throughput; 2) there exists a threshold for the number of antennas at the AP, above which the network throughput will no longer increase even if we add more antennas at the AP."

In the past, many interconnection topologies have been proposed - some most popular being hypercube, torus, mesh, De Bruijn networks, etc. Recently, some efficient interconnection topologies called Gaussian networks and Eisenstein-Jacobi networks have been introduced. The topologies of these networks are based on the concepts of Gaussian and EJ integers. In this talk, first a brief overview of these number theory concepts including how to obtain modulo of a given Gaussian or EJ number is given. Then, the interconnection topology, the topological properties, Hamiltonian decomposition of these networks, routing and broadcasting algorithms, resource placement algorithms, etc. are presented."

MSRCR(Multi Scale Retinex with Color Restoration) and IMSR (Integrated Multi Scale Retinex) are the two most popular Retinex algorithms in the literature. In this talk, a new algorithm \"FH-IMSR\" is presented to solve the problems existing in the MSRCR and IMSR algorithms. These problems include distortion of grey out due to the individual treatment of RGB channel, color noise due to log function, and halo effect occurred by the use of the Gaussian filter. The original IMSR algorithm is based on a RGB color model. The separate treatment for each channel in RGB space brings a phenomenon to change the rate of RGB, which causes grey out problem in the restored image. To solve this problem, FH-IMSR proposed to transform RGB color model into HSV color model, and apply the Retinex treatment on the luminance channel V. To remove color noise occurred by the use of log function, the Hue differences in the original image and restored image are minimized. To reduce Halo-artifact, FH-IMSR proposed to use Fuzzy C-means Clustering algorithm to cluster image pixels into dark area, middle area, and bright area, and different strategies are proposed to deal with brightness restoration on the three types of areas. Experiments on a wide variety of images are conducted, and comparisons with MSRCR and IMSR algorithms are made. The results showed that the proposed FM-IMSR algorithm has better performance than MSRCT and IMSR algorithms."

The main goal of ISD model is to organize the process of designing effective online courses or self-study materials for both higher education and K-12. The current paper proposes a heuristic instructional system model based on Kemp's model; ASSURE Model, and Keller's model, in addition to using the LORI instrument to evaluate the quality of the learning objects. Designing instructional material for Distance Learning in higher education is inherently different than face-to-face learning. This is because of the intervention of temporal, psychological and geographical distance between teacher and learner via a Web-based interface. The current model introduces new strategies for designing online courses based on creating learning objects. Using motivational strategies design is an essential part in designing these objects to sustain learners' attention on online courses. This paper further highlights the benefits of using this model and various challenges in designing learning objects and incorporating several components of the model."

We use the Matlab to simulate the proposed algorithm as compared with sequential algorithm. Experimental measurements verify the performance improvement of the proposed jumping algorithm."

We consider a system where a macro base station (MBS) and a femto base station (FBS) together serve a number of mobile users. In this system, base stations and users make decisions in various resource management processes with different optimization objectives. Such decision making processes are usually correlated and an efficient mechanism is needed to coordinate the decision makers. We propose a four-stage resource management mechanism where access control, resource allocation (in both frequency and time domain) and power control are performed sequentially at the base stations and users, respectively. We formulate a resource management problem and find the optimal decisions for base stations and users. We show that this mechanism provides incentive for the FBS to operate in hybrid access mode. Simulation results show that the proposed resource management mechanism achieves a better performance than the mechanism with closed access."

The sudden rise of interest in inkjet printed electronics is due to the recent development of conductive inks which can achieve conductivities close to that of copper. In this short course, inkjet printing process and its applications in RF electronics are discussed along with the issues and challenges compared to conventional photolithographic techniques. The materials that can be used to produce inks along with the ink properties required for the inkjet process are also discussed. Inkjet printing allows use of several different kinds of flexible, low cost and transparent substrates which are described in this course. An overview of state of the art inkjet printed devices and systems is presented. Applications of inkjet printing with design examples including antennas, passives and transistors are shown."

We formulate a two-dimensional Markov chain, and give an analysis on the average queuing delay and the average power consumption from the grid. Then, a linear programming problem is formulated to minimize the average delay under the constraint of a maximum allowable power consumption from the grid.

One of the 12 NKEAs which is Electrical and Electronics is expected to create GNI of RM90B and the creation of 157,000 jobs. The areas identified in the E&E are LED, Solar, industrial electronics and home appliances, Semiconductor as well as nanotechnology that will include the creation of whole value chain industry. Additionally the National Science and Research Council (NSRC) has identified 9 sectors that Malaysia must pursue for it to become a competitive nation in the future. Thus for Malaysia to succeed in the future, its innovation ecosystem must be strengthen and improved; thus The Quadruple Helix framework; ie the collaboration between IHLs and Industry supported by government policies and financial supports must be promoted. This presentation will address the issues of the innovation ecosystem and the quadruple helix. The roles of industry; ie particularly in the technology deployment in the GTP/ETP initiatives as well as various corridors across the country will be linked to the IHLs through the setting up of the COEs in the universities. Various grants schemes to support the R&D&C will be highlighted and some of the issues in the technology commercialisation will be presented. Some proposals in the creation of High Impact Research programs will be proposed that in line with the GTP/ETP which could be funded by various government funding agencies."

Defect classification plays a major role in categorizing the defects based on components, sub components, different product areas etc. A well defined defects classification mechanism is a base for any type of defect analysis. Defects can be classified based on tags. These tags can be user-defined, shared or personal tags related to any area in a product. Tags can be used for searching the work items and viewing the tagged artifacts. Tags are very easy to create but yet very helpful in categorizing the defects for analysis. Tags are generally used for very specific, detailed defect analysis. During the product implementation, we have used this tagging mechanism extensively which helped us analyzing the defects for better product stability, better performance, focusing on specific areas that needs improvement in the product. We created filter for the tags and saved that view in the project dashboard for quick analysis. We also used the defect view to create a tag cloud which displays the number of work items by tag attribute. In this article, we would show how to use tags effectively and write query with tag attribute for filtering of defects in specific areas in a product. Upon analyzing these tags we found some interesting issues in the product. In this paper, we will show defect categorization using tag cloud in a dynamic way. We will also present how tag cloud provides details of the defect based on importance and number of occurrences. The defect analysis also highlighted some components which needed more attention."

In order to improve the performance of TCP protocol, several studies have been proposed in different directions. Some of them attempt to find a suitable path for TCP transmission. Expected Transmission Count (ETX) is one of the most famous routing metrics to select a path with the least expected transmissions. However, ETX does not consider the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) mechanism in TCP, which generates extra transmissions. By modifying the ETX, we proposed a Frame-based TCP-ETX (FTCP-ETX), which calculates the expected frame transmissions for a TCP segment transmission. To evaluate our proposal, we conducted simulations by comparing FTCP-ETX, ETX and DSDV. Simulation results reveal that our routing metric improves TCP performance by selecting a better path."

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. Building Information Modeling (BIM) for new museum building design has been in use since the past decade. It allows architects, engineers and consultants to digitally co-design structures and exhibit spaces needed for museum collections. This process leads to a complete digitization of the physical museum, creating a parametric model that opens up a possibility for future integration with the museum's and community's digital artifacts. Museums are also currently in the process of exploring participatory digital strategies with their user communities and engage them in collection, digitization and archival processes. A new element in the participation by visitors and community would be to engage them digitally with the museum's building model and its physical space. Can BIM, community's and visitors' historic digital collections be integrated to create a shared and collaborative museum digital ecosystem? How will this digital building model of a historic museum space serve as a parametric platform for the digital artifacts of the participating community? Could a museum exhibit the community's digital artifacts via 3d Projection Mapping using the BIM model of the interior of the museum? By this, visitors and community could then insert their own historic collections into the museum, exhibit them through AV projections and thus transform the museum space as a stage for the display of the community's collections. Along these lines, this paper investigates various digital and participatory methods to engage user communities with museum buildings. It also explores inherent challenges towards an integrated museum model, and raises questions of sustainability that come along with it."

As the percentage of generation from renewable generation provides us a greener and more sustainable future, it also introduces new challenges in scheduling and dispatching controllable resources to follow the net load and control the power balance in the system. The increased renewable generation tends to introduce more variability that must be met by the traditionally more flexible generation resources. Incentives are needed to encourage the existing generators of all types to maximize the availability of their operational “load following” flexibility and to encourage entry of new flexible suppliers such as energy storage devices or demand response."

Since Needham and Schroeder introduced the idea of an active attacker, a lot of research has been made on the technical side of information security in order to verify the protocols' claims against this type of attacker. Nowadays, the Dolev-Yao threat model is the most widely accepted attacker model for that. Consequently, we tend to consider systems when secure against an attacker under Dolev-Yao's assumptions. With the introduction of the human-centric security ideas we include human peers in our designs. With this addition we can potentially find and solve security flaws that were previously not detectable.In this talk, we will discuss that even though Dolev-Yao's threat model can represent the most powerful attacker possible, the attacker in this model is not realistic in certain scenarios, especially those related to the human peers. We look over other variations of threat models, including a dynamic threat model that can be adjusted according to each social-technical context. These new perspectives will help us to model and analyse security requirements in human-computer interaction always regarding to realistic scenarios without degrading security and improving usability."

In the last few years, as Si CMOS faces mounting difficulties to maintain its historical scaling path, InGaAs-channel MOSFETs have emerged as a credible alternative for mainstream logic technology capable of scaling to the 10 nm node and below. To get to this point, a number of fundamental technical problems had to be solved though there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before the first non-Si CMOS technology becomes a reality. The intense research that this exciting prospect is generating will also reinvigorate the long march of InGaAs FETs towards the first true THz electronics technology.

The reason is clear: There are too many hours of surveillance video for people to watch. Most attempts to deal with the overflow of surveillance video involve the development of automatic video understanding: object recognition and activity understanding. Video Synopsis is complementary to video understanding. After objects are detected by background subtraction, video synopsis changes the time of display of each object such that more objects are \"packed\" into a shorter time. The resulting video is a shorter summary of the original video, where the objects are shown more densely than in the original video. While video synopsis can reduce, on the average, an hour of video into a minute, the synopsis loses causality: Objects that appear together in the original video may appear at different time in the synopsis, and vice versa. The combination of video synopsis and video understanding is expected to give the maximum benefit. As video understanding is still not fool proof, people need to examine its results. Since the video showing all objects of interest will be too long, video synopsis is an excellent tool to display efficiently the results of video understanding, for video examination and even for training classifiers."

But the nonuniformity from CMOS sensor greatly limits the image quality of spot-detecting camera. So the nonuniformity must be corrected before image processing. In this paper, several sources of the nonuniformity and suppression methods are analyzed. The method of two-point nonuniformity correction is used to correct real-time image which is captured by STAR1000. The result of objective evaluation for the method shows that correction effect can satisfy the practical requirement. Positioning accuracy and signal-noise ratio of spot-detecting camera can be improved. At the same time energy demand of beacon used for laser communication is reduced."

        "abstract": "Rarely seen rock carvings, known as Pitoti, which tell an autobiographical story of prehistoric life, are to be recreated for a world-wide audience using 3D animation techniques which are still in development. The ambitious 3D-PITOTI project, involves over 30 scientists from across Europe and focusses on the rock-art in Valcamonica Valley, Italy, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The 3D-PITOTI project will significantly advance both the state of the art in rock-art research methodology and the recording of flat 3D structures in general. Moreover it will not only 'take the rock-art to people' for the first time but will convey Pitoti knowledge to a much wider audience in interactive and engaging ways."

As one of the most commonly used wind generator, the doubly-fed induction generator based wind turbine's integration may lead to mal-operations to distribution network over-current protections. Based on simulation results, our paper analyzes the fault features of doubly-fed induction generator and its impact on current protection; then our paper further studies the impact of wind turbine capacity and its operation mode on distribution network protections."

This paper mainly focuses on the relationship between Neutral Section scheme and train's runtime. Under the analysis of the influence on train operation by different positions of neutral section, local optimization rules are given. Then, genetic algorithm is introduced in the optimizing problem of neutral section schema, neutral section's kilometer post of each plan is taken as an individual, chromosomes of sequential list are set up, and single - point crossover and deletion mutation methods are taken into consideration. At last, software on neutral section optimizing schema of electric railway is developed based on VS2008/MFC, which is applied for the optimization of the practice lines. The comparison result with current scheme verified the correctness and the practicality of the theory."

According to the requirements of image registration in visual aided navigation, this article provides a novel algorithm with graph spectral method. Through the study of spectrum diagram in the form of the algebra, the distribution in the feature space is analytical in image structure. Firstly, a comparability matrix based on the graph spectral theory is created. Secondly, the characteristic similarity measure is introduced. And then, the comprehensive similarity matrix for singular value decomposition and bleaching process is created. Finally, the refreshing accurate matching probabilities are gained by the relaxation method to judge whether the image is matched. Experiments show that the novel algorithm offers better performance under the disturbance of rotation and scale."

Given a fairly small number of spatial points at each frame and a high level of outliers, a bounding box is drawn around the region of interest. The first algorithm searches the bounding box having the greatest density. The second algorithm searches the bounding box whose theoretical 2D random distribution matches best with the 2D empirical random distribution. An estimate of the error is also provided by the second algorithm. These two algorithms are tested on synthetic data and real data: the second algorithm has better performance on synthetic data, whereas the first algorithm has better performance on real data and could be used in real-time applications. As information related to a feature can be represented as a set of points, these algorithms may prove useful to computer vision designers in feature selection or in data fusion (fusion of different tracks derived from different features)."

A second widely addressed theme is the conservation of documents relative to an archeological site, together with the growth of functions in databases that can also cover the 3D space. We propose to join these two topics using 3D geometric objects to index a spatial database. St Trophime Cloister of Arles (France) has been a scientific playground for geometry processing and 3D visualization over the Internet. In order to propose to archaeologist and cultural heritage managers an interface that will offer access to all documents related to the Cloister we developed a 3D database indexation and its selection system. Gracefully to the standards evolution of the Internet, this is made possible in a simple web browser. The documents linked to a part of the building are then selected by a visual choice in 3D. According to the user position the geometry is dynamically loaded/unloaded, the details in the visualization engine are adapted to keep a high-performance system and a sufficient quality. The support of a well known communication protocol (HTTP) also enhances the access to the application and makes the platform accessible from the public or the scientists but introduces drawbacks in the capabilities of the application (geometry loadings, memory management, network latency)."

It is shown that the system state can rapidly converge to the equilibrium point no matter whether it is far away from the equilibrium point or near the equilibrium point. Since the switching control by switching functions is not used, the chattering phenomenon is avoided. Simulation results demonstrate the rapidness and efficiency of the designed nonlinear tracking-differentiators."

Therefore, different elementary functions, subtending the mobility and proper to different spaces, are identified; these functions, which should be evolvable and suitable for constant human-environment co-evolution, could be integrated in new ICT holistic technological mobility assistance. A state-of-art of some of existing and on-going academic ICT projects, which target the appropriate support of the mobility concept will be provided."

        "abstract": "Wi-Fi and femtocell are two competing and complementary technologies for delivering broadband wireless Internet access services. For the Wireless Service Provider (WSP) who owns both Wi-Fi and femtocell network, pricing for the coexisted heterogeneous network is a critical yet challenging problem due to different features of the two technologies: Wi-Fi is based on wireless local area network (WLAN), whose time delay is highly dependent on concurrent in-service users; femtocell is based on cellular technology, which provides guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we consider a monopolist WSP who operates both Wi-Fi and femtocell network within a certain area, and offers corresponding services to a fixed pool of users. Users can freely choose either service that incurs less cost, which is a weighted sum of service price and time delay. Users with different sensitivity for price and time delay tend to choose different services. The major objective of WSP is to maximize its profit, which is the revenue from both services. We first analyze user distribution under different Wi-Fi and femtocell price combination, then study the optimal pricing strategy for WSP. Finally, we use simulation to evaluate the influence of Wi-Fi network quality on the WSP's utility and user distribution."

Over the next few years, the importance of collaboratory participation nets will further increase active creation and passive consumption. By 2015, immersive nets become predominant, integration local tags, wireless networks and smart environment's offer a cloud of information accessible and editable both remotely and in-person. After 2017, metaverse nets will take this augmented world and add connections with virtual environments. Although innovative, the risk and disruption to these new architectures will present challenges to the loT Cyber domain needing to address the very large numbers of 'things/objects' handing data in this new global information space."

In response to the current semiconductor technology trends that make chips becoming less reliable, DeSyRe describes a new generation of by design reliable systems, at a reduced power and performance cost. This is achieved through the following main contributions. DeSyRe defines a fault-tolerant system architecture built out of unreliable components, rather than aiming at totally fault-free, and hence more costly chips. In addition, DeSyRe systems are on-demand adaptive to various types and densities of faults, as well as to other system constraints and application requirements. For leveraging on-demand adaptation/customization and reliability at reduced cost, a new dynamically reconfigurable substrate is proposed and combined with runtime system software support. The above define a generic and repeatable design framework for a large variety of SoCs, which within the project - is applied to two medical SoCs with high reliability constraints and diverse performance and power requirements. In this talk, an overview of the DeSyRe and our current research findings are described."

They are chemostat models that have been widely applied in both mathematical and biological fields. Secondly, using the Lyapunov stability theory, we analyze asymptotic behavior for solutions of differential equations' models and get the stability results for the balance nodes. Then we have the main result: bad breath, as a disease, should be cured by professional methods. Simulation results prove our results."
