        "abstract": "Traffic incidents such as road accidents and vehicle breakdowns are a major source of travel uncertainty and delay, but the mechanism by which they cause heavy traffic is not fully understood. Traffic management controllers are tasked with routing repair and clean up crews to clear the incident and often have to do so under time pressure and with imperfect information. To aid their decision making and help them understand how past incidents affected traffic, we propose Traffic Origins, a simple method to visualize the impact road incidents have on congestion. Just before a traffic incident occurs, we mark the incident location with an expanding circle to uncover the underlying traffic flow map and when it ends, the circle recedes. This not only directs attention to upcoming events, but also allows us to observe the impact traffic incidents have on vehicle flow in the immediate vicinity and the cascading effect multiple incidents can have on a road network. We illustrate this technique using road incident and traffic flow data from Singapore."

It keeps the unexpanded nodes in their relative layers with slight changes in their original coordination. This helps the users in maintaining their mental map of the underlying graph. We applied the proposed algorithm for navigating through compound graphs representing the failure mechanisms in embedded systems. We also performed a brief user evaluation study in order to measure the users' acceptance level with regard to the application of CluE for compound graphs. Results show a high acceptance ratio from users having different backgrounds, which indicates the intuitiveness and feasibility of our approach."

A 2D representation of the transfer function feature space, called transfer function map, is then constructed for each volume data set by MDS projection of the collected transfer function samples.

One of the most widely used tools for revealing Lagrangian coherent structures has been to calculate the finite-time Lyapunov exponents, whose maximal values appear as ridgelines to reveal Lagrangian coherent structures. In this paper we explore an alternative formulation of Lyapunov exponents for computing Lagrangian coherent structures."

Our system enables the interactive selection of variables that are highly correlated to fish catches recorded by fishermen on their vessels. We illustrate the use of this system using a real-world simulation of the Pacific Ocean. Vortex structures, such as those used for fishing grounds exploration, are crucial for exploring fishing ground because they can drive nutrients from the ocean floor to the sea surface. The ability to locate fishing grounds therefore depends on accurate ocean forecasting systems for calculating ocean model variables such as temperature, salinity, velocity etc. Currently, these forecasts are based on multiple spatio-temporal simulations that produce multidimensional and multivariate results. Critical points in the ocean model are good indicators of the likelihood of finding microscale vortices, and our visualization approach enables the interactive exploration and analysis of these critical points. The proposed system makes it possible to analyze the vortex structure in the spatial domain, and explore fishing grounds on the sea surface in detail."

In this process, a successful visualization should support analyzing and comparing different scenarios. Therefore, in this study, several visualization techniques are combined to provide an effective representation of a water distribution system. The main parameter to visualize is nodal pressure. First, the nodal pressure values for the study area are obtained as a function of operation time using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPANET model. Then, the time steps are represented as small multiple maps. In order to improve the visibility of each node, all the nodes along the edges are aggregated and represented as a single node. The circle view representation is used to visualize two values of a nodal pressure variable. Finally, the water network is mapped onto a grid, which allows a user to see every node individually without overlaps. Results show that this combination of visualization techniques to illustrate the water network scenarios is beneficial for decision makers to provide sustainable urban water services."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a technique for rendering multiple irregular volumes using a stochastic approach. In this approach, we extend our stochastic projected tetrahedral (SPT) algorithm to treat irregular volumes. The SPT algorithm is a sorting-free volume rendering algorithm that projects a tetrahedral cell onto an image plane and controls the particle rendering using the opacity as the probability in the rasterization process. In the rasterization process, the particle depth is determined as that of a pre-defined location, which may be the front, back or middle point on a ray segment in the SPT algorithm. This determination causes a prominent artifact when treating multiple volumes, although it does not cause any problem when treating a single volume. The artifact occurs because the SPT algorithm controls the particle stochastically in the image plane but not in the depth direction. In the volume rendering process, it is assumed that the number of particles follows a Poisson distribution along the segment of the viewing ray that intersects the tetrahedral cell. The particle spacing follows the exponential distribution. In this case, we construct a cumulative distribution function of the particle spacing and develop a technique for calculating the nearest particle along the interval. We apply this technique to multiple volumes to confirm its effectiveness."

What makes such analytical visualization more important is recent rapid development of range-sensing technology to digitally archive real 3D objects. For example, modern laser scanning produces over 107 or 108 3D point data for one measurement. To extract useful information from such large-scale and complex data, we need (A) precise 3D transparent visualization, (B) superposition of visual assistants, and (C) time-series visualization."

Nevertheless, with increasing size of the information in the web-space, it has become very difficult to visualize information and the inherent relationships among the information. Because of web graphs being messy and large, end users need to allow extra effort to mine interested information from those. Existing web graphs produce relationships among nodes (URLs) based on structural linkage information. As a result, by producing similar visualization to different end users, this approach lacks effectiveness considering diversity of users' need. In our work, we encounter this issue of personalization in visualization of web graph. We propose a different web graph which capitalizes on user interests to develop relationships among nodes of the web graph. Examples show that this web graph can represent web information to the end user for more effective and effortless information search."

For visualizing such kind of large-scale dataset, reducing the data size by using compression methods is one of the most useful approach. Moreover, parallelization of compression algorithm can greatly improve the efficiency and resolve the limitation of memory size. However, in parallel compression algorithm, interprocessor communication is indispensable, while it is also a bottleneck problem, especially for the general cases that the number of processors is not power-of-two. Parallel POD (proper orthogonal decomposition) compression algorithm is such an example, the number of time steps must be power-of-two for the binary swap scheme. A method that can fully resolve this problem with low computational cost will be very popular. In this paper, we proposed such an approach called 2-3-4 combination approach, which can be simply implemented and also reach high performance of parallel computing algorithms. Furthermore, our method can obtain the best balance among all parallel computing processors. This is achieved by transferring the non-power-of-two problem into power-of-two problem to fully use the best balance feature of binary swap method. We evaluate our approach through applying it to the parallel POD compression algorithm on the K computer."

As their background is different, there exist difficulties in the communication while assessing data and images. We provide a visualization of the thorax containing CT (Computer Tomography) and EIT images closing this gap. It is 3D, multimodal, semiabstract and suitable for both groups, and shows a rendered thorax volume with an embedded 2D EIT movie. The EIT image reconstruction contains several computational intermediate stages which are used to improve the volume rendering transfer function. Additionally, isosurfaces show context structures to understand spatial coherences more easily. The visualization is designed to be interactive and remove visual clutter to provide a direct view to the lung, which is the focus of interest. The results show that our visualization is able to give a basis for discussion for medical researchers as well as for computer scientists. Phenomena that have been discovered during long discussions are easier to detect. Furthermore it is possible to obtain new knowledge and address questions in terms of EIT."

We proposes a new method that embeds a high-dimensional 3D fiber model as a continuous map in a 2D normalized space, built on fibers from all targeted fiber models. One advantage over previous 2D embedding approaches is that our method represents all fiber models in a unified coordinate system by taking a cluster-and-project routine, ensuring that closely located fibers from different models will be projected to close points on the 2D map. Using this projected 2D map, subtle differences that are difficult to distinguish in 3D space can be clearly displayed and individual fiber model can be effectively summarized. We applied our method to group comparison and analysis of various fiber models."

        "abstract": "Parallel Coordinates is an often used visualization method for multidimensional data sets. Its main challenges for large data sets are visual clutter and over plotting which hamper the recognition of patterns in the data. We present an edge-bundling method using density-based clustering for each dimension. This reduces clutter and provides a faster overview of clusters and trends. Moreover, it allows rendering the clustered lines using polygons, decreasing rendering time remarkably. In addition, we design interactions to support multidimensional clustering with this method. A user study shows improvements over the classic parallel coordinates plot in two user tasks: correlation estimation and subset tracing."

Thus not only more movements of people are tracked but also POI (point of interest) information becomes available in increasing geo-spatial density. To enable analysis of movement behavior, we present an approach to enrich trajectory data with semantic POI information and show how additional insights can be gained. Using a density-based clustering technique we extract 1.215 frequent destinations of ~150.000 user movements from a large e-mobility database. We query available context information from Foursquare, a popular location-based social network, to enrich the destinations with semantic background. As GPS measurements can be noisy, often more then one possible destination is found and movement patterns vary over time. Therefore we present highly interactive visualizations that enable an analyst to cope with the inherent geospatial and behavioral uncertainties."

        "abstract": "Advanced composites such as fiber reinforced polymers are promising candidate materials for future components as they allow integrating the continuously rising demands of industry regarding cost-effectiveness, function-orientation, integration and weight. The most important structures of fiber reinforced polymers are the individual fibers, as their characteristics (stiffness, strength, ductility, durability, etc.) to a large extent determine the properties of the final component. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new system for interactive exploration and visual analysis of fiber properties in X-ray computed tomography data of fiber reinforced polymers. The presented tool uses parallel coordinates to define and configure initial fiber classes. Using a scatter plot matrix linked to the parallel coordinates the initial classification may be refined. This allows to analyze hidden relationships between individual fiber properties. 2D and 3D views depict the resulting fiber classifications. By using polar plots an intuitive rendering of the fiber orientation distribution is provided. In addition, two modules of higher abstraction are proposed: The Blob visualization creates a hull around fibers with similar characteristics. The fiber metadata visualization allows to calculate overlays for 2D and 3D views containing regional information of particular material characteristics. The proposed system has been evaluated by two groups of domain experts. Applying the presented concepts the user feedback shows that the domain experts are now able to efficiently perform tasks as classification of fibers, visualization of fiber lengths and orientations, and visualization of fiber regions. The insights gained can be forwarded to the design office as well as to material development and simulation, in order to speed up the development of novel composite components."

Given a set of v variables, there are v(v- 1)/2 pairs of variables, and thus the same number of possible pair wise scatter plots. Therefore for even small sets of variables, the number of scatter plots can be large. Scatter plot matrices (SPLOMs) can easily run out of pixels when presenting high-dimensional data. We introduce a theoretical method and a testbed for assessing whether our method can be used to guide interactive exploration of high-dimensional data. The method is based on nine characterizations of the 2D distributions of orthogonal pair wise projections on a set of points in multidimensional Euclidean space. Working directly with these characterizations, we can locate anomalies for further analysis or search for similar distributions in a large SPLOM with more than a hundred dimensions. Our testbed, ScagExplorer, is developed in order to evaluate the feasibility of handling huge collections of scatter plots."

In this paper, we present a novel approach, called GraphFlow, to visualize dynamic graphs. In contrast to previous approaches that provide users with an animated visualization, GraphFlow offers a static flow visualization that summarizes the graph metrics of the entire graph and its evolution over time. Our solution supports the discovery of high-level patterns that are difficult to identify in an animation or in individual static representations. In addition, GraphFlow provides users with a set of interactions to create filtered views. These views allow users to investigate why a particular pattern has occurred. We showcase the versatility of GraphFlow using two different datasets and describe how it can help users gain insights into complex dynamic graphs."

In areas on the map densely populated by these objects, visual clutter and occlusion of glyphs occur. We propose a method to solve this problem by partitioning the set of all objects into subsets that are each visualized using an aggregated multivariate glyph that shows the distribution of several attributes of its objects, such as heading, type and velocity. We choose the combination of subsets and glyph design such that the glyphs do not overlap and the number of subsets is approximately maximal. The partition is maintained and updated while the objects move. We use examples from the maritime domain, but our method is applicable to a wider range of dynamic data. Through a user study we find that, for a set of representative tasks, our method does not perform significantly worse than competitive visualizations with respect to correctness. Furthermore, it performs significantly better for density comparison tasks in high density data sets. We also find that the participants of the user study have a preference for our method."

With the help of heatmaps, we can visualize the profile of a particular conference or journal over the base map. Similarly, heatmap profiles can be made of individual researchers or groups such as a department. The visualization system also makes it possible to change the data used to generate the base map. For example, a specific journal or conference can be used to generate the base map and then the heatmap overlays can be used to show the evolution of research topics in the field over the years. As before, individual researchers or research group profiles can be visualized using heatmap overlays over a specific journal or conference base map. We outline a modular and extensible system for term extraction using natural language processing techniques, and show the applicability of methods of information retrieval to calculation of term similarity and creation of a topic map.

        "abstract": "Vector field simplification aims to reduce the complexity of the flow by removing features in order of their relevance and importance, to reveal prominent behavior and obtain a compact representation for interpretation. Most existing simplification techniques based on the topological skeleton successively remove pairs of critical points connected by separatrices, using distance or area-based relevance measures. These methods rely on the stable extraction of the topological skeleton, which can be difficult due to instability in numerical integration, especially when processing highly rotational flows. These geometric metrics do not consider the flow magnitude, an important physical property of the flow. In this paper, we propose a novel simplification scheme derived from the recently introduced topological notion of robustness, which provides a complementary view on flow structure compared to the traditional topological-skeleton-based approaches. Robustness enables the pruning of sets of critical points according to a quantitative measure of their stability, that is, the minimum amount of vector field perturbation required to remove them. This leads to a hierarchical simplification scheme that encodes flow magnitude in its perturbation metric. Our novel simplification algorithm is based on degree theory, has fewer boundary restrictions, and so can handle more general cases. Finally, we provide an implementation under the piecewise-linear setting and apply it to both synthetic and real-world datasets."

One way to approach this question is to identify structures of interest by a human observer. The challenge then, is to find similar structures in the same or other datasets on different scales and orientations. In this paper, we propose to use moment invariants as pattern descriptors for flow fields. Moment invariants are one of the most popular techniques for the description of objects in the field of image recognition. They have recently also been applied to identify 2D vector patterns limited to the directional properties of flow fields. In contrast to previous work, we follow the intuitive approach of moment normalization, which results in a complete and independent set of translation, rotation, and scaling invariant flow field descriptors. They also allow to distinguish flow features with different velocity profiles. We apply the moment invariants in a pattern recognition algorithm to a real world dataset and show that the theoretic results can be extended to discrete functions in a robust way."

        "abstract": "Visualization applications implicitly run queries on the data to retrieve distributions and statistical measures derivable from distributions. Distribution based data summaries can substitute for the raw data to answer statistical queries of different kinds. However, frequent access to the raw data is no longer practical, if possible at all, for answering large number of queries on large-scale data. Our work addresses the issue by accelerating range distribution query, which returns the distribution of an axis-aligned query region. Maintaining the interactivity of such query is a challenging task because the workload and the response time of such queries scale up with the data and the query size. In this paper, we present a framework for answering range distribution queries for any arbitrary region in near constant time, regardless of data and query size. We adapt an integral histogram based data structure to bound the workload which is a combination of computation, I/O and communication cost. We propose two novel transformations of this data structure -- a decomposition and a similarity-driven indexing -- to reduce the huge storage cost associated with it. In addition to studying the performance of range distribution query, we also demonstrate the benefits that our technique offers to visualization applications which directly or indirectly require distributions."

We facilitate a case study to validate our hypothesis. For the case study we consider the design of a reinforcement structure of a brake lever, a plastic ribbing. Three new lever geometries are developed on basis of our hypothesis and are compared against each other and against a reference model.

Power Graph Analysis offers an alternate way to draw a graph in which sets of nodes with common neighbours are shown grouped into modules. An edge connected to the module then implies a connection to each member of the module. Thus, the entire graph may be represented with much less clutter and without loss of detail. A recent experimental study has shown that such lossless compression of dense graphs makes it easier to follow paths. However, computing optimal power graphs is difficult. In this paper, we show that computing the optimal power-graph with only one module is NP-hard and therefore likely NP-hard in the general case. We give an ILP model for power graph computation and discuss why ILP and CP techniques are poorly suited to the problem. Instead, we are able to find optimal solutions much more quickly using a custom search method. We also show how to restrict this type of search to allow only limited back-tracking to provide a heuristic that has better speed and better results than previously known heuristics."

OnionGraph allows nodes to be aggregated based on either node attributes, topology, or a mixture of both. Subsets of nodes can be flexibly split and merged under the hierarchical focus+context interaction model, supporting sophisticated analysis of the network data. Node aggregations that contain subsets of nodes are displayed with multiple concentric circles, or the onion metaphor, indicating how many levels of abstraction they contain.

        "abstract": "Large-scale networks have become increasingly challenging to manage. It is vital for a system administrator or network manager to be able to analyze the vast amount of log data in order to detect suspicious behaviors or patterns, possibly due to malicious users/applications or faulty devices. While an intrusion detection system (IDS) log can provide a large number of warnings, exactly which alarms are true while the others are false, and more importantly what are the underlying causes are still difficult to know. To bridge the gap between network log and anomaly discovery, we design and implement a visualization tool that combines multiple commodity visualizations with minimum learning curve. While each individual view is well understood, the effects of such views in analyzing network anomalies are not well studied. Since each visualization technique has advantages as well as limitations in addressing a particular task, we show that these views, when combined and linked together, may provide an effective and lightweight network anomaly analysis tool. The web-based open platform may simplify network administration as well as promote collaborative analysis among researchers."

This approach creatively transforms the geographic coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) to street names reflecting contextual semantic information. Consequently, the movement of each taxi is studied as a document consisting of the taxi traversed street names, which enables semantic analysis of massive taxi data sets as document corpora. Hidden themes, namely taxi topics, are identified through textual topic modeling techniques. The taxi topics reflect urban mobility patterns and trends, which are displayed and analyzed through a visual analytics system. The system integrates interactive visualization tools, including taxi topic maps, topic routes, street clouds and parallel coordinates, to visualize the probability-based topical information. Urban planners, administration, travelers, and drivers can conduct their various knowledge discovery tasks with direct semantic and visual assists. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by case studies using a large taxi trajectory data set acquired from 21, 360 taxis in a city."

Our scheme uses 3D points that are directly acquired using a laser scanner as the rendering primitives. For laser-scanned data that consist of more than 107 or 108 3D points, the pre-processing stage takes only a few minutes, and the rendering stage is executable at interactive frame rates. We do not encounter rendering artifacts originating from the indefiniteness of depth-sorted orders of rendering primitives. Fused visualization with various visual assistants is also possible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by visualizing a campus building and a culturally important festival float."

The surface area of all cavities and the diameter of pockets and channels is computed to provide evidence for their accessibility. These values are also plotted in 2D graphs for a quantitative time-dependent analysis. For dynamic simulation data sets, the cavities are tracked to show their stability over time. The user is provided with a range of application-related parameters to interactively adjust the analysis algorithms. A sequence diagram shows the structure of the protein and additional annotations like binding sites. Furthermore, all views support brushing and linking for consistent selection and filtering. All algorithmic steps are implemented to run interactively on a commodity workstation. As a result, the user can immediately see the effect of a parameter change. This enables the real-time analysis of a running simulation for in-situ visualization."

Crisis maps are generally used by both state and non-state actors for sense-making and as a reference point for action. The current crisis map visualizations only show the location from which documents such as reports or short messages have been generated. Such a limited representation fails to immediately show important content, such as themes from a document and their changes over time. As a result, sense-making becomes time-consuming and cognitively demanding. We present a new visualization approach, Geo-Temporal Tag Visualization (GTViz), which treats the tags on the crowd sourced reports as spatio-temporal textual datasets. GTViz embeds a map to represent the spatial properties of the dataset and compactly shows the changes of key terms from the data source over time. We demonstrate the value of GTViz through two case studies and a controlled user study."

In recent years, pushed by the ever increasing data complexity in many areas, numerous advances in such techniques have been observed, primarily in terms of computational efficiency and support for interactive applications. Both these achievements were made possible due to the introduction of the concept of control points, which are used in many different multidimensional projection techniques. However, little attention has been drawn towards the process of control points selection. In this work we propose a novel multidimensional projection technique based on radial basis functions (RBF). Our method uses RBF to create a function that maps the data into a low-dimensional space by interpolating the previously calculated position of control points. We also present a built-in method for the control points selection based on \"forward-selection\" and \"Orthogonal Least Squares\" techniques. We demonstrate that the proposed selection process allows our technique to work with only a few control points while retaining the projection quality and avoiding redundant control points."

Although conventional methods provide an interface for locally rearranging such a feature space, category-level global manipulation is still missing and thus manually rearranging the overall image categorization usually requires a time-consuming task. This paper presents a novel approach to exploring images in the database through the manipulation of bi-level feature space representations, where the upper-and lower-level representations characterize the global categories and local features of the images, respectively. In this approach, the upper-level space describes similarity relationship among the underlying categories extracted from the bag-of-features model, while the lower-level space encodes the closeness between a pair of images within the same category. The key idea behind this approach is to associate the relationship between the two feature spaces with a two-layered graph representation and project it onto 2D screen space using pivot MDS for user manipulation. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that our approach allows users to understand the entire structure of the given image dataset and reorganize the layout according to their preference both locally and globally."

We first extend the seam carving algorithm to broaden the roads of interest in a map with the least distortion to other areas, and then embed temporal displays into the roads to reveal temporal patterns without the occlusion of map information. We study various design choices in our method, including the encoding of the time direction and temporal display, and conduct two comprehensive user studies to validate our design decisions. We also demonstrate the usability of our approach with case studies on real traffic flow data in a major city."

We use two basic operations to iteratively replace consecutive arcs until the desired complexity is reached. Our results are not restricted to arcs ending at input vertices. The method can be steered towards different degrees of 'curviness': we can encourage or discourage the use of arcs with a large central angle via a single parameter. Our method creates visually pleasing results even for very low output complexities. We conducted an online user study investigating the effectiveness of the curved schematizations compared to straight-line schematizations of equivalent complexity. While the visual complexity of the curved shapes was judged higher than those using straight lines, users generally preferred curved schematizations. We observed that curves significantly improved the ability of users to match schematized shapes of moderate complexity to their unschematized equivalents."

Finally, we design a tour that traverses all selected viewpoints in a smooth and efficient manner for visual navigation and exploration of the flow field. Unlike most existing works which only consider external viewpoints, a unique contribution of our work is that we also incorporate internal viewpoints to enable a clear observation of what lies inside of the flow field. Our algorithm is thus particularly useful for exploring hidden or occluded flow features in a large and complex flow field. We demonstrate our algorithm with several flow data sets and perform a user study to confirm the effectiveness of our approach."

Gerhard Michal created his seminal drawings of metabolic networks in the 1960s and thus defined canonical representations of some key pathways. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) provides the most popular static drawings of biological networks of different types, used in a huge number of publications. These drawings are so widely known that they are immediately recognizable to most biologists. This enables collaborative work and simplifies the communication of analysis results. Automatic layout of these pathway maps is complicated by the fact that the information available from KEGG does not contain the entire layout information of the reference maps. Here we present a fully automated algorithm for interactive KEGG layout construction. The algorithm conserves the original KEGG layout to the extent possible while improving readability by removing unnecessary elements (in organism-specific maps). Multiple pathway maps can be laid out simultaneously to facilitate the navigation of larger networks. The algorithm supports the hierarchical layout of sub networks and thus supports interactive exploration of large datasets."

Parallel-coordinates plots supplement this visualization scenario by providing statistical analysis of the geometry for distinct pairs of co-dimensions. Such analysis results in visual signatures that embed geometric structures such as symmetry, and thus allows us to overview the status of the missing dimensions while exploring the projected geometry. This paper presents a blue-noise sampling approach for efficient construction of continuous parallel-coordinates plots of high-dimensional geometric surfaces defined by mathematical equations. We employ the parallel-coordinates plots with the embedded visual signatures to assist the interactive exploration of high-dimensional geometries, typically for 2-manifold embedded in 4-space. While we interactively explore the 3D projected geometry, we can observe dynamic changes on its visual signature. Various geometric properties can also be identified and visualized. Moreover, we can interactively brush the plots, and see their counterparts in the 3D projection. Assorted geometric properties such as curvature can further be used to enhance the visual signature."

        "abstract": "As systems grow at an increasing pace to keep up with the demand for larger data and ever more detailed simulations, failures also occur more frequently on various levels. Traditionally, fault tolerance for visualization is either disregarded due to performance reasons or handled analogously to the state of the art for high performance computing (HPC), for example rollback-recovery. In this paper we summarize the inherent challenges of distributed visualization as well as the applicability and differences of fault tolerance methods used in HPC and distributed visualization. We derive complementary methods to increase the resilience of such systems and present visualization specific methods for failure semantics and masking."

        "abstract": "Measuring the similarity of integral curves is fundamental to many important flow data analysis and visualization tasks such as feature detection, pattern querying, streamline clustering and hierarchical exploration. In this paper, we introduce FlowString, a novel approach that extracts shape invariant features from streamlines and utilizes a string-based method for exploratory streamline analysis and visualization. Our solution first resamples streamlines by considering their local feature scales. We then classify resampled points along streamlines based on the shape similarity around their local neighborhoods. We encode each streamline into a string of well-selected shape characters, from which we construct meaningful words for querying and retrieval. A unique feature of our approach is that it captures intrinsic streamline similarity that is invariant under translation, rotation and scaling. Leveraging the suffix tree, we enable efficient search of streamline patterns with arbitrary lengths with the complexity linear to the size of the respective pattern. We design an intuitive interface and user interactions to support flexible querying, allowing exact and approximate searches for robust partial streamline similarity matching. Users can perform queries at either the character level or the word level, and define their own characters or words conveniently for customized search. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowString with several flow field data sets of different sizes and characteristics."
