It recursively coarsens a graph and then uncoarsens the drawing using layout refinement. In this paper, we leverage the Louvain community detection algorithm for the multi-level graph drawing paradigm.More specifically, we present the Louvain-based multi-level graph drawing algorithm, and compare with other community detection algorithms such as Label Propagation and Infomap clustering. Experiments show that Louvain-based multi-level algorithm performs best in terms of efficiency (i.e., fastest runtime), while Label Propagation and Infomap-based multi-level algorithms perform better in terms of effectiveness (i.e., better visualization in quality metrics)."

When do topics change? Do they ever come back? What do people mainly talk about? In this study, we design and propose a novel visual analytics system to answer these interesting questions. We abstract the topic per unit time as a point in a two-dimensional space through document embedding and dimensionality reduction techniques and provide supplemented charts that represent words appearing at a certain time and the time-series change of word occurrence over the entire period. We employ a novel text visualization technique, called semantic preserving word bubbles, to visualize words at a certain time. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using Twitter data about early COVID-19 trends in Japan. We propose our system to help users to explore and understand transitions in posted contents on SNS."

        "abstract": "Analysis of large, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous datasets is challenging as no one technique is suitable for visualizing and clustering such data in order to make sense of the underlying information. For instance, heterogeneous logs detailing machine repair and maintenance in an organization often need to be analyzed to diagnose errors and identify abnormal patterns, formalize root-cause analyses, and plan preventive maintenance. Such real-world datasets are also beset by issues such as inconsistent and/or missing entries. To conduct an effective diagnosis, it is important to extract and understand patterns from the data with support from analytic algorithms (e.g., finding that certain kinds of machine complaints occur more in the summer) while involving the human-in-the-loop. To address these challenges, we adopt existing techniques for dimensionality reduction (DR) and clustering of numerical, categorical, and text data dimensions, and introduce a visual analytics approach that uses multiple coordinated views to connect DR + clustering results across each kind of the data dimension stated. To help analysts label the clusters, each clustering view is supplemented with techniques and visualizations that contrast a cluster of interest with the rest of the dataset. Our approach assists analysts to make sense of machine maintenance logs and their errors. Then the gained insights help them carry out preventive maintenance. We illustrate and evaluate our approach through use cases and expert studies respectively, and discuss generalization of the approach to other heterogeneous data."

        "abstract": "With the high growth rate of text data, extracting meaningful information from a large corpus becomes increasingly difficult. Keyword extraction and analysis is a common approach to tackle the problem, but it is non-trivial to identify important words in the text and represent the multifaceted properties of those words effectively. Traditional topic modeling based keyword analysis algorithms require hyper-parameters which are often difficult to tune without enough prior knowledge. In addition, the relationships among the keywords are often difficult to obtain. In this paper, we utilize the attention scores extracted from Transformer-based language models to capture word relationships. We propose a domain-driven attention tuning method, guiding the attention to learn domain-specific word relationships. From the attention, we build a keyword network and propose a novel algorithm, Attention-based Word Influence (AWI), to compute how influential each word is in the network. An interactive visual analytics system, KeywordMap, is developed to support multi-level analysis of keywords and keyword relationships through coordinated views. We measure the quality of keywords captured by our AWI algorithm quantitatively. We also evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of KeywordMap through case studies."

        "abstract": "Tree boosting models are widely adopted predictive models and have demonstrated superior performance than other conventional and even deep learning models, especially since the recent release of their parallel and distributed implementations, e.g., XGBoost, LightGMB, and CatBoost. Tree boosting uses a group of sequentially generated weak learners (i.e., decision trees), each learns from the mistakes of its predecessor, to push the modelâ€™s decision boundary towards the true boundary. As the number of trees keeps increasing over training, it is important to reveal how the newly-added trees change the predictions of individual data instances, and how the impacts of different data features evolve. To accomplish these goals, in this paper, we introduce a new design of the temporal confusion matrix, providing users with an effective interface to track data instancesâ€™ predictions across the tree boosting process. Also, we present an improved visualization to better illustrate and compare the impacts of individual data features (based on their SHAP values) across training iterations. Integrating these components with a tree structure visualization component, we propose a visual analytics system for tree boosting models. Through case studies with domain experts using real-world datasets, we validated the systemâ€™s effectiveness."

In this paper, we introduce Papers101, an interactive system that supports novice researchers' discovery of papers relevant to their research topics. Prior to system design, we performed a formative study to investigate what difficul-ties novice researchers often face and how experienced researchers address them. We found that novice researchers have difficulty in identifying appropriate search terms, choosing which papers to read first, and ensuring whether they have examined enough candidates. In this work, we identified key requirements for the system dedicated to novices: prioritizing search results, unifying the contexts of multiple search results, and refining and validating the search queries. Accordingly, Papers101 provides an opinionated perspective on selecting important metadata among papers. It also visualizes how the priority among papers is developed along with the users' knowledge discovery process. Finally, we demonstrate the potential usefulness of our system with the case study on the metadata collection of papers in visualization and HCI community."

        "abstract": "Route planning and navigation are common tasks that often require additional information on points of interest. Augmented Reality (AR) enables mobile users to utilize text labels, in order to provide a composite view associated with additional information in a real-world environment. Nonetheless, displaying all labels for points of interest on a mobile device will lead to unwanted overlaps between information, and thus a context-responsive strategy to properly arrange labels is expected. The technique should remove overlaps, show the right level-of-detail, and maintain label coherence. This is necessary as the viewing angle in an AR system may change rapidly due to usersâ€™ behaviors. Coherence plays an essential role in retaining user experience and knowledge, as well as avoiding motion sickness. In this paper, we develop an approach that systematically manages label visibility and levels-of-detail, as well as eliminates unexpected incoherent movement. We introduce three label management strategies, including (1) occlusion management, (2) level-of-detail management, and (3) coherence management by balancing the usage of the mobile phone screen. A greedy approach is developed for fast occlusion handling in AR. A level-of-detail scheme is adopted to arrange various types of labels. A 3D scene manipulation is then built to simultaneously suppress the incoherent behaviors induced by viewing angle changes. Finally, we present the feasibility and applicability of our approach through one synthetic and two real-world scenarios, followed by a qualitative user study."

Different methods have been developed that describe the strength of this oscillation, but they rely on certain assumptions, e.g., fixed positions of these two pressure systems. It is possible that climate change affects the mean location of both the Low and the High and thus the validity of these descriptive methods. This study is the first to visually analyze large ensemble climate change simulations (the MPI Grand Ensemble) to robustly assess shifts of the drivers of the NAO phenomenon using the uncertain northern hemispheric surface pressure fields. For this, we use a sliding window approach and compute empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) for each window and ensemble member, then compare the uncertainty of local extrema in the results as well as their temporal evolution across different CO2 scenarios. We find systematic northeastward shifts in the location of the pressure systems that correlate with the simulated warming. Applying visualization techniques for this analysis was not straightforward; we reflect and give some lessons learned for the field of visualization."

However, creating an expressive scrollytelling story requires both data and design literacy and is time-consuming. As a result, scrollytelling has been mainly used only by professional journalists to disseminate opinions. In this paper, we present an automatic method to generate expressive scrollytelling visualization, which can present easy-to-understand data facts through a carefully arranged sequence of views. The method first enumerates data facts of a given dataset, and scores and organizes them. The facts are further assembled, sequenced into a story, with reader input taken into consideration. Finally, visual graphs, transitions, and text descriptions are generated to synthesize the scrollytelling visualization. In this way, non-professionals can easily explore and share interesting perspectives from selected data attributes and fact types. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our method through both use cases and an in-lab user study."

        "abstract": "The availability of devices that track moving objects has led to an explosive growth in trajectory data. When exploring the resulting large trajectory collections, visual summaries are a useful tool to identify time intervals of interest. A typical approach is to represent the spatial positions of the tracked objects at each time step via a one-dimensional ordering; visualizations of such orderings can then be placed in temporal order along a time line. There are two main criteria to assess the quality of the resulting visual summary: spatial quality â€“ how well does the ordering capture the structure of the data at each time step, and stability â€“ how coherent are the orderings over consecutive time steps or temporal ranges?In this paper we introduce a new Stable Principal Component (SPC) method to compute such orderings, which is explicitly parameterized for stability, allowing a trade-off between the spatial quality and stability. We conduct extensive computational experiments that quantitatively compare the orderings produced by ours and other stable dimensionality-reduction methods to various state-of-the-art approaches using a set of well-established quality metrics that capture spatial quality and stability. We conclude that stable dimensionality reduction outperforms existing methods on stability, without sacrificing spatial quality or efficiency; in particular, our new SPC method does so at a fraction of the computational costs."

        "abstract": "Widely used in news, business, and educational media, infographics are handcrafted to effectively communicate messages about complex and often abstract topics including `ways to conserve the environment' and `coronavirus prevention'. The computational understanding of infographics required for future applications like automatic captioning, summarization, search, and question-answering, will depend on being able to parse the visual and textual elements contained within. However, being composed of stylistically and semantically diverse visual and textual elements, infographics pose challenges for current A.I. systems. While automatic text extraction works reasonably well on infographics, standard object detection algorithms fail to identify the stand-alone visual elements in infographics that we refer to as `icons'. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to train an object detector using synthetically-generated data, and show that it succeeds at generalizing to detecting icons within in-the-wild infographics. We further pair our icon detection approach with an icon classifier and a state-of-the-art text detector to demonstrate three demo applications: topic prediction, multi-modal summarization, and multi-modal search. Parsing the visual and textual elements within infographics provides us with the first steps towards automatic infographic understanding."

        "abstract": "Finding the propagation scope for various types of issues in Software Product Lines (SPLs) is a complicated Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. This task often requires human-in-the-loop data analysis, which covers not only multiple product attributes but also contextual information (e.g., internal policy, customer requirements, exceptional cases, cost efficiency). We propose an interactive visualization tool to support MCDM tasks in software issue propagation based on the user's mental model. Our tool enables users to explore multiple criteria with their insight intuitively and find the appropriate propagation scope."

However, it is very difficult to find suitable alternatives materials in traditional ways for its incredible high cost in searching. Machine learning (ML) based methods are currently introduced and used for material prediction. But there is rarely an assisting learning tools designed for domain experts for institutive performance comparison and analysis of ML model. In this case, we propose an interactive visualization system for experts to select suitable ML models, understand and explore the predication results comprehensively. Our system employs a multi-faceted visualization scheme designed to support analysis from the perspective of feature composition, data similarity, model performance, and results presentation. A case study with real experiments in lab has been taken by the expert and the results of confirmed the effectiveness and helpfulness of our system."

Recent dMRI studies aim to compare connectivity patterns across subject groups and disease populations to understand subtle abnormalities in the brainâ€™s white matter connectivity and distributions of biologically sensitive dMRI derived metrics. Existing software products focus solely on the anatomy, are not intuitive or restrict the comparison of multiple subjects. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of FiberStars, a visual analysis tool for tractography data that allows the interactive visualization of brain fiber clusters combining existing 3D anatomy with compact 2D visualizations. With FiberStars, researchers can analyze and compare multiple subjects in large collections of brain fibers using different views. To evaluate the usability of our software, we performed a quantitative user study. We asked domain experts and non-experts to find patterns in a tractography dataset with either FiberStars or an existing dMRI exploration tool. Our results show that participants using FiberStars can navigate extensive collections of tractography faster and more accurately. All our research, software, and results are available openly."

Re-searchers from different fields of expertise are increasingly applying graph visualization and analysis to explore unknown phenomena, complex emerging structures, and changes occurring over time in their data. While several empirical studies evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of different network representations, visualizing the temporal dimension in graphs still presents an open challenge. In this paper we propose an exploratory user study with the aim of evaluating different combinations of graph representations, namely node-link and adjacency matrix, and temporal encodings, such as superimposition, juxtaposition and animation, on typical temporal tasks. The study participants expressed positive feedback toward matrix representations, with generally quicker and more accurate responses than with the node-link representation."

We describe computational techniques as well as the rendering effects to produce painterly representations of graphs and networks. We present visualization examples with various networks from diverse domains, from pure mathematics to social systems.

We visualize these biclusters in a 2D layout to support interactive visual exploration of the analyzed search results, which highlights a novel way of organizing entities of biclusters. We evaluated our approach using a large academic publication corpus, by testing the distribution of the relevant documents and of lead and prolific authors. The results indicate the effectiveness of our approach compared to traditional 1D ranked lists. Moreover, a user study with 12 participants was conducted to compare our proposed visualization, a simplified variation without topics, and a text-based interface. We report on participants' task performance, their preference of the three interfaces, and the different strategies used in information seeking."

In this paper, we present the first machine learning approach for predicting human preference for graph layouts.In general, the data sets with human preference labels are limited and insufficient for training deep networks. To address this, we train our deep learning model by employing the transfer learning method, e.g., exploiting the quality metrics, such as shape-based metrics, edge crossing and stress, which are shown to be correlated to human preference on graph layouts. Experimental results using the ground truth human preference data sets show that our model can successfully predict human preference for graph layouts. To our best knowledge, this is the first approach for predicting qualitative evaluation of graph layouts using human preference experiment data."

Yet developing visualisation techniques that clearly and accurately convey uncertainty in data is an open challenge across a variety of fields. This is especially the case when visualising temporal uncertainty. To facilitate the development of innovative and accessible temporal uncertainty visualisation techniques and respond to an identified gap in the literature, we propose the first-ever survey of over 50 temporal uncertainty visualisation techniques deployed in numerous fields. Our paper offers two contributions. First, we propose a novel taxonomy to be applied when classifying temporal uncertainty visualisation techniques. This takes into account the visualisation's intended audience, as well as its level of discreteness in representing uncertainty. Second, we urge researchers and practitioners to use a greater variety of visualisations which differ in terms of their discreteness. In doing so, we believe that a more robust evaluation of visualisation techniques can be achieved."

        "abstract": "The ability to capture common characteristics among complex multi-variate time series variables can profoundly impact big data analytics in uncovering valuable insights into the relationships among them and enabling a dimensionality reduction technique. Two widely used data displays include time series and scatter plots. While the former focuses on the dynamics over time, the latter deals with static relationships among variables. Motivated by these distinctive perspectives, our research aims to maximally utilize the information captured by both at the same time. This paper presents NetScatter, a visual analytic approach to characterizing changes of pairwise relationships in a high-dimensional time series. Unlike most traditional techniques that employ a single perspective of the visual display, our approach combines static perspectives of two variables in multi-variate time series into a single representation by comparing all data instances over two different time steps. The paper also introduces a list of visual features of the representation to capture how overall data evolve. We have implemented a web-based prototype that supports a full range of operations, such as ranking, filtering, and details on demand. The paper illustrates the proposed approach on data of various sizes in different domains to demonstrate its benefits."

In this paper, we present an extension of that concept to time-dependent ensemble data.

Then, we present two variations of sublinear-time stress minimization method on two popular stress-based layouts, Stress Majorization and Stochastic Gradient Descent.Experimental results demonstrate that our sublinear-time algorithms run, on average, about 35% faster than the state-of-art linear-time algorithms, while obtaining similar quality drawings based on stress and shape-based metrics."
