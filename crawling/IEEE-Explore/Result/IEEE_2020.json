This unwanted effect gives rise to power fading and ghost targets, which leads to degraded estimation performance and increased false alarms. In this paper, we present mathematical formulations for multipath propagation model and the corrupted echoes, where frequency modulated continuous wave as a commonly adopted transmit waveform in automotive radars is considered. The impact of the multipath propagation on target detection is then analyzed. Additionally, a simple but effective algorithm is proposed to remove the ghost targets. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the satisfactory performance."

This paper reviews the possible behaviour of Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) under AC faults considering different grid conditions and control objectives as well as the resulting impact on the line protection functionality. One main result is that typical distance protection relays will mal-operate when installed at radial line ends terminated by MMCs due to the different short circuit powers of the MMC and the grid, the flexible phase angle of the MMCs AC side voltage and the changed current profiles under asymmetrical faults compared to HVAC systems fed by synchronous generators. For cases in which the MMCs is connected at busbars with multiple outgoing lines, the impact of the MMC depends on the short circuit power of the connected nodes. However, even for low short circuit powers of the surrounding grid, both distance and differential protection work reliably as the MMC does not significantly change the characteristic behaviour of the AC transmission grid."

Due to lower parasitics, GaN devices enable higher switching frequencies and thus higher power densities. However, in comparison to silicon MOSFETs the higher voltage drop during reverse conduction causes more losses during dead time. Therefore, it is essential to adjust the dead time to the actual operation point. This paper proposes a novel method to determine the optimal dead times of the transitions within the half-bridges of an inverter with LC output filter. The dead time is adapted in every switching cycle using variables, which are typically present in the control unit of the inverter. This allows an efficient implementation of the method on microprocessors. The study reveals, based on a 48 V GaN inverter, that the optimal dead time varies in a large range and thus indicates the necessity of an adaptive dead time."

Hence, the contactless speed/torque transmission leads to improvements in terms of efficiency and reliability, due to the absence of wear out between moving parts. For a specific application, the most appropriate magnetic coupling configuration (i.e. axial or coaxial) is usually identified through a trade-off study. In this paper, a comparative analysis between axial and coaxial magnetic couplings is presented using a two-dimensional subdomain approach. Based on a full-parametric geometry, two 2D analytical tools are developed for each magnetic coupling configuration. These analytical tools are validated against finite element results in order to prove their effectiveness. Finally, the implemented models are used to investigate the impact of parameters, such as permanent magnet span, airgap thickness and number of pole-pairs, on the maximum static torque."

        "abstract": "Smart cities are becoming more popular with the increasing demand for applying the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The objective of smart cities is to increase the use of resources efficiently and to preserve data security, integrity, and controlling network infrastructure management. IoT concept can solve many problems related to smart cities, and car parking is one of these problems as with the increase in vehicles' numbers and traffic congestion, the need for a smart parking system has been raised. The parking system will not solve only the driver's problem looking for an available parking space but also will enhance the parking monitoring and management problem. In this research, a detailed and comprehensive literature survey of the previous studies and project implementations will be reviewed to explore the best practices done and to find the gaps in previous studies. Implementation and development of a smart parking system based on IoT technology have been proposed using the simulation method. The system will monitor the parking spaces and enable the drivers to check the available parking slots and reserve it for a specific time. The reservation of the parking slot can save the drivers' time and reduce the consumption of fuel, and this will even lead to the reduction of the emission of Carbon Monoxide (CO) gas to the air by the vehicles."

The method is compared with the classical Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) detector, and it is demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms CFAR approximately by a factor of 2 terms of probability of detection (PD) and by a factor of 100 in terms of probability of false alarm (PFA), at a minor cost of computational complexity."

Conventionally, I-V droop control is an effective way to parallel converter modules due to its high reliability, extendibility and economy. However, when the effect of mismatching line resistances is considered, the traditional droop control has limitations on the voltage regulation while the load current sharing accuracy is maintained. In this paper, an improved nonlinear droop control method is adopted to realize both accurate load current sharing and local output voltage improvement, which is achieved by adaptively adjusting nonlinear I-V droop curve with the information of DC bus voltage. Meanwhile, a secondary controller of DC bus voltage restoration is introduced to realize voltage drop compensation through the secondary regulation of I-V curve. The simulation model with two source converters and a single Constant Power Load (CPL) was built in Matlab-Simulink, which can be extended to multiple sources and multiple loads connected to the DC bus. Compared with the simulation results of the traditional droop control method and another improved droop control method, the better performance of the adopted control strategy is validated."

Our system employs Generative Adversarial Networks of deep learning techniques, which became very popular for many applications. The proposed system has also some valuable properties for the consumers, such as having a completely original design that no other clothing brand offers. We validated the proposed system by performing experiments on volunteers by showing the produced designs and getting their opinions.

But still, the speed of the bikes available in the market is quite low or if people go for some more top speed electric bikes that are very costly. So, in this work, two high speed 36 slots, 24 poles exterior rotor motors are designed for the high-speed, smooth operation of an electric bike. The design of the Hub motors is done based on the hand calculations of the design parameters. Then the RMxprt models are designed using those calculated data, and various iterations are performed for getting the required design. But here, just the final design sheets and plots are shown. Also, the RMxprt models are converted to Maxwell 2D design model for further analysis and accurate and precise design. This paper consists of a comparative study of both the designs based on these calculations, results and graphs. This research work gives a clear concept to the reader for selecting a suitable model according to their applications."

In this contribution, an extended iron loss model is introduced with a direct identification methodology in the context of temperature estimation. The iron loss model is implemented as part of a fourthorder lumped-parameter thermal network (LPTN), which is parametrised using empirical measurements and global identification. Once parameters are identified using training data, the LPTN model is validated using three unseen profiles cross-validation. Satisfactory estimation is achieved with the average mean squared error of 2.1 K2 and the error bias close to zero."

Analytical modeling of power-electronic converters including the weight of the components allows assessing the power density already in the design phase. However, more design variables exponentially increase computation time. This paper combines analytical modeling with genetic or evolutionary optimization to drastically reduce computation time. This way, even more design variables or a higher level of detail in modeling can be considered. The strategy is applied to a DC/DC converter interfacing the 270V DC bus in an aircraft with a supercapacitor-based active power filter. Both the single-objective genetic optimization of power density and the multi-objective genetic optimization of power density and efficiency are discussed. The results demonstrate the technological benefits of wide-bandgap power semiconductor devices in a more electric aircraft setting."

The consequent technological evolution is not only affecting the structure of the electricity markets, but also the interactions between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs). New practical solutions are needed to improve the coordination between the grid operators at the national, TSOs, and local level, DSOs. In this paper, we define the flexibility range of coordination between TSOs and DSOs. By doing so, we propose an algorithm based on epsilon-constrained methods by means of mathematical programming and power systems principles. We evaluate and compare different classical optimal power flow formulations (AC–OPF, DISTFLOW, DISTFLOW–SOCP, and LINDISTFLOW) for building the flexible TSO-DSO flexible domain. The presented approaches in this paper are analyzed in an IEEE 33-bus test radial distribution system. We show that for this particular problem, the DISTFLOW–SOCP has the worst accuracy, despite the popularity among the academic community of convex relaxation approaches."

Various improved jamming strategies have been proposed, while the jamming technology is updated continuously. In this study, a new radar jamming detection method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) is presented. The method firstly uses the nearest-neighbour interpolation (NNI) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to analyse the signal within the time-frequency (TF) range, to obtain the great adaptability on the different condition; then, it uses CNN to detect whether the signal is contaminated by radar jamming and determine the type of jamming. The simulation results show that this method can not only identify transmitting deceptive jamming and velocity deception jamming effectively, but also has good anti-noise performance and robustness. Compared with the recognition method based on time-frequency distribution, the recognition accuracy is 15% higher than the conventional detection model."

First, feature extraction was performed by using Gabor filter. Then, combined with the extracted orientation feature, the ship recognition of SAR image is obtained by 2P-CFAR detector. Finally, false alarms among the candidate targets were removed by geometric features of the ships. To prove the rationality of this method, experiments were carried with two high-resolution Gaofen-3 satellite SAR images in open sea background. The experimental results show that the presented method has preferable performance in the accuracy of ship identification."

Worse still, the geographical positions of abnormal power towers are difficult to be obtained so that the maintenance team has no direction to proceed. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method for detecting and locating abnormal power towers from the aerial images captured by UAVs. In this method, an objection detection algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is firstly designed to identify and detect abnormal power towers from aerial images. Secondly, the geographical positions of the detected abnormal power towers are approximated by UAV metadata recorded in aerial images (e.g. pixel size, altitude, pitch angle, roll angle, yaw angle, et al.) and several coordinate transformations. Compared with the classical image processing methods, the present method is automatic and end-to-end, and can be easily applied in the UAV based inspection of power transmission lines."

        "abstract": "The wound field synchronous machine has widespread use both as a motor and a generator, due to its low cost, wide power range and its consolidated history built over decades of operation. A critical aspect of these machines is the method of excitation to the field winding. Typically, the choice is between a static excitation system using slip-rings and a rotating excitation system using a brushless exciter. An alternative is that of removing the classical exciter completely and thus feed the field winding through more advanced `exciterless' solution. The potential to reduce component count and improve power density has resulted in increasing interest in exciterless solutions, over the last couple of decades. This paper thus gives an overview of these methods, assessing and comparing their advantages and disadvantages. A particular focus is on medium power applications, which traditionally have dominated the market of synchronous generators and associated generating sets, and where significant improvements in terms of cost minimisation, power quality, and ease of design are always required."

        "abstract": "Reliable and scalable communication technologies are required to securely integrate and utilise the flexibility offered by different smart grid solutions. Smart secondary substations can play a critical role in enabling the flexibility services for the distribution system operator (DSO) with more monitoring and control functions being deployed at these substations. However, there are a number of challenges associated with the deployment and integration of communications to enable future DSO functions. This study defines the key requirements for future secondary substation communications and provides a number of recommendations to address future operator needs. A case study related to the deployment of a Smart Transformer for better utilisation of network assets and voltage regulation is presented to illustrate the applicability of aforementioned requirements."

Deep learning networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proposed for such tasks and showed better performance than traditional supervised learning paradigm. However, it is hard to deploy CNN networks to embedded systems due to the limited computational power available. From this point of concern, the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed in this paper for human activities classification. We also propose an innovative data argumentation method to train the neural network using a limited number of data. The experiment shows that our network can achieve a mean accuracy of 94.3% in human activity classification."

The resonant current is first estimated at the input section of the PT. These data are used to indicate the effective signs for zero-voltage switching, applied to a phase-locked loop (PLL) as a reference input, to generate the in-phase gate drive signals with an adequate deadtime. Practical results show successful operation of the PLL controller. This technique is extended to achieve output regulation by a burst-mode hysteresis control. Experimental results demonstrate good agreement with the SPICE-based simulation for output regulation while achieving zero-voltage switching."

Our article introduces a Virtual Prototype based approach for the fault analysis and fast simulation of a set of automatically generated and target compiled software programs. The approach scales to different RISC-V ISA standard subset configurations and is based on an instruction and hardware register coverage for automatic fault injections of permanent and transient bitflips. The analysis of each software binary evaluates its opcode type and register access coverage including the addressed memory space. Based on this information dedicated sets of fault injected hardware models, i.e., mutants, are generated. The simulation of all mutants conducted with the different binaries finally identifies the cases with a normal termination though executed on a faulty hardware model. They are identified as a subject for further investigations and improvements by the implementation of additional hardware or software safety countermeasures. Our final evaluation results with automatic C code generation, compilation, analysis, and simulation show that QEMU provides an adequate efficient platform, which also scales to more complex scenarios."

This paper proposes a technique to automatically generate natural language summaries for software classes written in object-oriented programming languages. The technique parses the program's source code and identifies the stereotype for the target class and its corresponding methods. A set of predefined heuristics are proposed to select the methods that should be reflected in the generated summaries. A case study has been conducted to validate the proposed technique. Results indicated that the generated summaries provide concise and accurate contextual information about the class and help the developers in understanding their source code."

The results suggest that: (1) The terahertz and millimeter radar measurements contain enough information to constrain the retrieval of ice cloud properties regardless of a priori value and habits; (2) The retrieval error decreases as the accuracy of a priori increases. The error of spherical particle is basically smaller than that of the mixed particles; (3) Quantitative estimates of the retrieval error are provided. The effective radius is retrieved with errors varying between 0-7% and 0-13% for sphere and mixed habits, respectively.

The voltage drop across the parasitic inductance between Kelvin and power source is used to trigger the data acquisition circuit. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the concept of variable temperature sensitivity where the robustness decreases with the increase in the sensitivity. This concept proposes a trade-off between temperature sensitivity and robustness. A D flip-flop is used to make the acquisition circuit more robust to prevent false triggering while keeping fast switching speed and low noise susceptibility. Basic simulations, static and dynamic measurements are performed successfully on a commercially available 1.2 kV/120 A power module in a buck converter topology. The effect of DC-link voltage and load current invariance is also verified in this paper."

Peer to Peer (P2P) energy trading is one of the alternatives to curb the surplus energy flow and would also help in maintaining a dynamic balance between supply and demand in the power grid. In this paper, we propose a P2P energy trading mechanism with distributed solar photovoltaic, community battery storage, and electric vehicle charging points. Game theory is the most widely used approach for P2P energy trading because of its characteristic of solving complicated interactions between provider and receiver. In the present work, we have considered a coalition based cooperative game theory framework whose objective is to maximize the total profit of the coalition. The simulation framework of this mechanism has been tested on a local energy community with 100 households having 50 consumers and 50 prosumers creating a win-win approach for both consumers and prosumers (users able to generate and consume simultaneously). Various trading scenarios have been proposed in this paper depending on geographical location, maximum energy demand, and maximum energy generated. These trading scenarios have been tested on a low voltage model to check their feasibility for a real network. The best operational performance priority at each timeslot with solar PV and community storage has also been analysed."

In this paper, we compare an iterative OPF method against the standard exact AC OPF calculations in terms of the computational effort and solution quality. Furthermore, we highlight the suitability of the selected formulation to offer voltage support (VS) as an ancillary service to the transmission network. The results are demonstrated using a combination of a medium and low voltage grid, and show that tractable OPF formulations can unlock financial business cases for DNs that can actively participate in VS schemes."

In this paper typical parameters of topological structure of the complex network has been utilized in order to ascertain the criticality of transmission line subjected to a potential threat of outage. Attacks can also lead cascading failure, casing substantial damage in power transmission sector in turn gives a very bad impact on the economical aspect of the power system. In this analysis, sincere attempts have been made to assess redistribution of load in the adjacent surviving lines following simulated outage of a line having highest magnitude of electrical betweenness. The concept of preferential load distribution among adjacent lines is being considered here and its simulation examines the possibility of cascading failure, subsequent to dynamic redistribution of load following simulated tripping of the preceding line with highest electrical betweenness. The iterative process continues till it converges to a single line, following successive tripping of overloaded transmission lines. Finally outage of this surviving transmission line leads to islanding of the grid network. The developed technique of assessment of cascading failure of a power grid has been investigated and tested on the topological model of IEEE 57 bus test system."

Cosine, Fourier, and Walsh data windows are commonly used. Short windows yield faster protection operation but allow larger transient errors jeopardizing protection security and calling for adequate countermeasures. Often, these countermeasures erase some, if not most, benefits of shorter data windows. This paper presents the theory, implementation, laboratory test results, and a field case example of a new filtering method for protective relaying based on window resizing. The method uses a full-cycle sliding data window until a disturbance is detected, at which time the window size is considerably shortened to include only disturbance samples and exclude all pre-disturbance samples. With passing of time, the window size grows to include more disturbance samples as they become available. When the window reaches its nominal full-cycle size, it stops extending and starts sliding again. By purging the pre-disturbance data, the new filter strikes an excellent balance between speed and accuracy. We derive the method for fixed sampling and processing rates and include compensation for frequency deviations in the input signals."

        "abstract": "A comprehensive compensation method of negative sequence and harmonic for co-phase traction power supply system in electrified railway with Dd transformer and static var generator (SVG) is presented in this paper. With this method, not only can the comprehensive compensation of negative sequence and harmonic be realized, but also the potential safety hazards can be reduced when a locomotive passes through the neutral section. Taking Dd0 transformer as an example of Dd transformer, topologies of the comprehensive compensation schemes are presented in detail, which are divided into compensation mode I and compensation mode II. From the perspective of mathematical analysis, mathematical model of the comprehensive compensation is deduced in detail, and the basic principle of comprehensive compensation is revealed. Based on the mathematical model, the method to determine the compensation scheme is given. Aiming at the comprehensive compensation methods of mode I and mode II, the closed-loop control strategies for compensation mode I and mode II are proposed respectively. Finally, effectiveness and accuracy of the method and control strategies proposed in this paper are verified by the simulation models."

A full 58% of all operational hours in neighbourhoods are projected to run self-sufficient with solar-photovoltaic (PV), generator and batteries.

In this context, Ankara University Turkish Sign Language dataset is used to synthesize new sign videos using a given signer frame as a reference and a skeleton stream. To solve this challenging problem, a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed, where skeletal data is used as a condition. Using the trained model, we are able to generate sign video streams with the given signer, where the motion dynamics are successfully and fluently encoded in the video. Moreover, we evaluated the quality of the generated images using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric; the FID score is 26."

        "abstract": "Switching losses of DC-DC converters such as the boost converter can be reduced using soft switching techniques. However, the auxiliary circuits required for the switches increase the complexity and cost of the converters. Switching devices based on wide bandgap (WBG) materials such as gallium nitride (GaN) have low switching losses compared to silicon (Si) devices hence they can be an alternative to decrease the switching losses while keeping the simple structure of the conventional converters. The high cost of WBG devices together with their high level of electromagnetic interference (EMI) cause concern. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of these two methods in DC-DC converters in terms of efficiency, power density, reliability, EMI and cost. Therefore, two soft and hard switching boost converters using Si and GaN power switches, respectively, are simulated and compared theoretically. It is shown that the Si-based soft switching topology causes less EMI, while GaN-based hard switching topology provides better power density, efficiency, cost, and reliability. Finally, the simulation results of both converters are presented to confirm that they operate properly."

To prevent the propagation of an inter-turn fault, the machine must stay within its thermal requirements at the location of the fault. We present a fault tolerant control scheme which minimizes the propagation of the fault by adapting the operating point of the machine. The heat loss of the inter-turn fault is estimated with a machine learning regression. If the estimated heat is greater than the maximum allowable value, the operating point is adapted until the estimated heat is below this limit. We validated the concept of the control scheme with a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation. For the presented fault scenario, we are able to reduce the heat of the inter-turn fault by 17:5W, which equals a temperature reduction of 140 K. Therefore, we are able to keep the local temperature at the fault under the heat shock temperature of the isolation material."

There has two common system-integrated technologies for offshore wind farms, as high voltage alternating-current (AC) and flexible direct-current (DC) transmission technologies. Because of its advantages such as small occupied area, modular structure, flexible power flow control and suitable for long transmission distance, flexible DC transmission technology has become the main one for deep-sea wind farms which are far away from the seashore to integrate into the onshore transmission power system. Currently there has the national wind power basement with 10 million kilowatts in Jiangsu. How to economic and safety to make large-scale wind farms accessible, especially the deep-sea wind farms, has become a prominent problem for onshore transmission system planning.

After that on the premise of ensuring the stability of the onshore power grid, the application scheme using flexible DC transmission technology in the integration planning of offshore wind farms in Jiangsu is proposed, by means of wind-power optimization distribution method."

        "abstract": "When carrying an alternating current, the windings in an electrical machine experience increased losses, due to proximity and skin effects. Quantifying these is necessary to fully understand the impact of motor efficiency, requiring the use of finite element analysis of the winding. For an axial flux machine with a three-dimensional flux path, this usually requires the use of threedimensional finite element analysis (FEA). This work presents a method of using simplified 2D FEA as an alternative to full 3D FEA, a dimensionless analysis argument to account for changing winding conductivities and a frequency-scaling is verified with FEA. The time required to characterise a windings AC losses is reduced by a factor of three orders of magnitude."

The combination of deep learning methods and micro-Doppler spectrograms for radar human activity recognition is becoming more and more popular, but the general network model has many parameters and long training time, making it difficult to train a better network model. Therefore, we have designed an efficient and lightweight network model, which is based on the Mobilenetv2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The model we proposed can learn the micro-doppler information and can automatically identify tasks of different types of human movements. We use the micro-Doppler spectrogram as the training data of the network model. The model has a small number of parameters. It can train a model very quickly. At the same time, it can trace-off the accuracy and resource requirements. It can be run on the embedded in the system, it can meet the requirements of the human activity recognition system. We have shown very good performance on the experimental data provided by the official, which can not only ensure the accuracy of the model to predict human activities, but also save a lot of training time. At the same time, our experiments found that a single human actvitiy can be quickly and accurately recognized, however, the complex human behavior composed of a series of single actions still needs to continue to work"

Temporally localized features are first extracted from range-time maps and micro-Doppler spectrograms by convolutional neural networks, and then fed into cascaded long-short-term memory for classification. The use of two types of signatures improves classification accuracy without adding much computational cost. The proposed method is evaluated on a relatively large dataset provided by the IET radar challenge “Human Activity Classification with Radar”. By using cross-validation of the training dataset, the proposed neural network achieves 94.8% accuracy taking dual signatures as input, which outperforms the networks using micro-Doppler signature input (93.5%) or range signature input (87.9%) only. On the test dataset, we achieve 100% accuracy via majority voting of multiple instances of the proposed neural network. This result won the first place in the IET radar challenge."

As more and more renewables are replacing conventional generations, integration of energy storage system (ESS) is crucial in providing faster response in balancing and grid services. However, ESS, of today, faces many regulatory and market challenges in order to be deployed in the power system operation. This is also hindering the progress towards the decarbonisation of smart grid network. This paper proposes ESS as a possible “Flexibility Resources” and its potential role in the future smart grid network. This will further support the regulatory authority to define this classification for ESS to overcome the barriers and to procure and valorise the range of services that the ESS can provide. The potential benefits of ESS as Flexibility Resource will facilitate increased participation of storage in different electricity markets and improve the flexibility of smart grid operation with high penetration of renewables.

During a fault, the scheme identifies that a fault has occurred and instructs each IBDG in the islanded microgrid to inject specific harmonic components in conjunction with fault current; relays in the network can subsequently detect the presence and location of the fault based on the injected combination of harmonic components. The coordination of relays is achieved through definite time settings, hence communication between the protective relays is not required to operate the scheme. Furthermore, the scheme categorises the protective relays into two groups to isolate the faulty section effectively to cater for bidirectional fault current flow — this is described fully in the paper. The paper presents the structure of the proposed protection scheme along with injection strategy through the control of IBDGs. Different fault scenarios are presented using a realistic microgrid model so that effectiveness of the proposed scheme can be demonstrated in terms of detecting, identifying the faulted section and isolating the fault to ensure dependability, security and selectivity of the microgrid protection scheme."

The training samples are theoretical target returns and theoretical constant-modulus deceptive signals, both modulated with different Doppler frequencies. Three classifiers, namely the support vector machines (SVM), Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), are considered and the SVM performs the best.

The OOS condition is predicted based on information of the ongoing power oscillation, where the input signal can be either the phase angle between two nodes in the power grid or the current magnitude of a line. The proposed algorithm first detects power swing by comparing the oscillation magnitude with a set threshold. Once a power swing is detected, a damping coefficient associated to the power oscillation is estimated to assess its stability. The oscillation is predicted unstable and eventually will lead to OOS condition when both the damping coefficient and the input signal are larger than set thresholds. The tuning of these thresholds is relatively simple and straightforward. Results from simulations in the Kundur system and the Nordic 44 model demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to correctly predict coming OOS conditions from the analysis of power swings in the power grid."

When multiple jammers apply jamming from different angles, the resulting false targets are azimuthally deceptive, which will further impact subsequent target positioning and precise guidance. In response to the above-mentioned multi-angle dense false target jamming situation, this paper proposes a complete narrowband array radar anti-jamming algorithm, which effectively suppresses the range dimensional jamming by Multiplicative Noncoherent Accumulation (MNCA), and filters the residual angle dimensional jamming by spatial filtering, Wherein, the azimuths of the jammers are obtained by K-means dynamic clustering based on constructed angle data set. Theoretical analysis and simulation show that the method has good jamming suppression ability, and can achieve accurate target ranging and angle measuring."

Firstly, the particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to minimize the correlation between the waveforms of the victim radar and the interfering radar. Then, the optimal filtering is achieved by the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm based on the reference signal to output interference suppression result. The simulation results show that the proposed method has a good performance on multi-type interference mitigation."

        "abstract": "The maximum voltage overshoot of SiC MOSFETs in power modules limits the switching speed of voltage source inverters in electric vehicles. As the efficiency increases with faster switching transitions, decreased commutation loop inductances allow higher switching speeds at same voltage overshoot level and extend the vehicle’s range. In this research, a SiC power module including an integrated RC-snubber is designed to increase the switching speed at same voltage overshoot. The RC-snubber acts as a damped low inductance commutation loop filtering the switching transients and suppressing the ringing, whereas the low frequency components are filtered by the dc-link capacitor. To meet the target of increased system efficiency, the losses of all inverter components are analyzed for space-vector modulation (SVPWM)."

Therefore, particular attention should be paid to the study of channel equalization. However, traditional channel equalization methods often have the problems of low operating efficiency, large computational burden and poor adaptability, making them less effective. Aiming at this problem, the signal model for multi-channel SAR-GMTI processing is established. Based on this, a novel channel equalization method is proposed in this paper. The experimental results based on the measured data of airborne 7-channel SAR-GMTI system show that the proposed method can effectively eliminate the amplitude and phase error between channels without the need for iterative operation, thus improves the calculation efficiency and GMTI processing effect simultaneously."

This article presents the importance of using renewable energy for smart city applications, current trends in installing renewable energy sources and different technologies used to store and distribute renewable electrical energy. Based on this study, it is suggested that more than one energy resources can be combined in a single power station to install high-capacity energy distribution and it can be managed by real-time optimized algorithms. Also noted that CO2 emission is very much reduced by using renewable sources of power in a smart city environment."

The proposed detector is formed by weighting two detectors, which behave quite differently in the presence of signal mismatch. By adjusting the value of the weight of the detector, the proposed detector can flexibly control the detection performance of mismatched signals. In particular, the proposed detector, with a small weight, is much more selective to mismatched signals. In contrast, the proposed detector, with a large weight, is very robust to mismatched signals. In addition, even in the case of no signal mismatch, the proposed detector with an appropriate weight can achieve higher probability of detection (PD) than the existing detectors. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed detector."

Although this scheme applies the conventional two-terminal current differential protection principle, it is properly designed to satisfy all the protection reliability requirements, as well as to deal with any particularities encountered in distribution systems. In this regard, coordination of the differential relays with the lateral protection means is ensured. The proposed scheme is applied to replica model of a real medium-voltage distribution network, which is assumed including distributed generators, as well as operating in a ring configuration. Moreover, a theoretical analysis of system operation conditions, which affect the performance of differential protection, is performed. Finally, an adaptive approach for the designed differential protection scheme is investigated, to address the varying post-fault system conditions."

As a consequence assisted living has been an active area of research, and radar has been identified as an emerging technology of choice for indoor activity monitoring. Activity classification has been investigated, but is often limited by the classification accuracy in the most challenging yet realistic cases. This paper aims to evaluate and improve the accuracy in classifying six commonly performed indoor activities from the University of Glasgow open dataset. For activity classification, the selection of features to discriminate between activities is paramount. Activity classification is usually done as one vs all strategy with one classifier and a set of features to distinguish between all the activities. In this paper, we propose to optimise the feature selection and classifier choice per activity using a hierarchical classification structure. This strategy reached 95.4% accuracy for all activities and about 100% for walking, opening the field for personnel recognition."

The proposed algorithm uses discrete wavelet transform to extract the features from the voltage and current signals which are measured from one end of the transmission line after the inception of faults. The approximation coefficients of the voltage and current signals are utilized to compute the line impedance. The three-line impedances of three phases are fed to the Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based fault locator to estimate the location of the fault. This paper is only focused to estimate the location of the single line to ground (SLG) fault, as the most commonly occurring fault in the transmission line is SLG fault. The significant feature of this paper is that the performance of the proposed fault locator is immune to fault resistance (FR) and fault inception angle (FIA). Moreover, the proposed approach is free from time synchronization error as the one end data is sufficient to locate the fault."

The surface flashover voltage of silicone rubber and resin insulation blanket decreases linearly at a temperature of 20 to 80 ℃, when the electrode distance is 4 cm, the reduction rates are 0.0453 and 0.0470 kV/℃, respectively, and the resin insulation blanket has better insulation performance. However, due to the thermal deformation of resin insulation blanket at 60 to 80 ℃, the insulation performance of resin insulation blanket decreases faster at high temperature."

One of the widely used methods for these types of businesses in the literature is modeling customer behavior using Beta-geometric Negative Binomial Distribution (BG/NBD). While this method performs favorably on predicting the total churn rate in a population, it is also known to perform poorly on labeling individual customers. This study aims to improve BG/NBD model by incorporating machine learning into its decision process. In the suggested method, the mathematical definition of BG/NBD model is used for feature extraction and utilized using decision trees. When tested on two data sets with different characteristics, it is observed that the suggested method improves performance by a significant amount."

A quasi-planar matrix transformer with high step-up/down ratio is demonstrated, whose leakage inductance is responsible for achieving soft-switching and power-transfer, without using any external inductors, resulting in a compact converter. A combination of low-voltage (LV) and high-voltage (HV) GaN transistors operating at both primary and secondary bridges, enabled operation at 300 kHz to significantly reduce the size of the ferrite core in the transformer. By applying the simplest modulation (single phase shift) suitable for very high switching frequencies, the converter could transfer up to 500 W (reaching up to 10 kW/l or 164 W/inch(exp 3) in power-density) with a peak efficiency of 97.4% at a 12-time step-up. After discussing guidelines of passive and active component design and selection, we benchmark DC-DC converters and compare the performance of our design to other state-of-the-art high-frequency converters. Furthermore, we discuss how such DC/DC converters could serve as chargers in electric vehicles (EVs) to provide efficient power transfer in a compact size with galvanic isolation, which is required for such applications. The converter can be regarded as a flexible DC transformer in future DC distribution systems and microgrids for efficient, compact and regulated power transfer."

Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) technologies can enable power electronic interface inverters to simulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SG), thereby controlling grid-connected inverters as synchronous inverters and greatly improving the grid's ability to accept distributed power supplies. Additionally, it also effectively reduces the impact of the traditional grid-connected inverter on the stable operation of the power system during the grid-connected and off-grid process, which shows natural friendliness to the power grid. Therefore, VSG technologies have great research value and wide application prospects. This paper first expounds the basic idea of VSG, then further analyses and studies it from mathematical modelling, control strategies, stability analysis and application prospects, and finally puts forward several possible future research directions based on the project of my task group."

        "abstract": "To solve the voltage fluctuation problem caused by distributed wind power connected to distribution network, a reactive power optimal dispatching method for coordinated control of distributed wind power and regional power grid considering uncertainty is proposed. Firstly, the influence of wind power access on the voltage quality of distribution network is analyzed, and the control idea of optimal operation is determined. Secondly, aiming at the problem of reactive power coordination optimization after wind power is connected to distribution network, a reactive power optimization model considering economy and power quality is established. The model is solved by introducing uniformly distributed initial harmony database and improved harmony search algorithm of variable dimension and voice database, and the results are compared with those of particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, the control strategy of reactive power optimization in distribution network is obtained. The test results show that the proposed optimization model and algorithm can achieve maximum wind energy absorption on the basis of satisfying the relevant constraints, especially ensuring the voltage quality of distribution network nodes."

Currently, the multi-function radar (MFR) is capable of transmitting complex and agile signals with different working modes, and the classification of radar waveforms using the traditional methods does not provide satisfactory results. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new intelligent algorithm to recognize the working mode of MFR. In particular, this paper designs a novel feature extraction method to obtain the sequential relationship of the input signals. At the same time, a hierarchy of signal features is established to represent the signals layer by layer, and then the working mode of the emitter is determined effectively by unsupervised clustering method. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method is experimentally verified, through simulating the real complex electromagnetic environment and generating the signal samples of MFR."

        "abstract": "The main problem for any transient earth-fault protection is to extract the useful signal components from the measured residual current Io. Many used solutions are based on either complete fundamental frequency and/or complete higher harmonic phasors. However, for the fundamental frequency current phasor of the Io current, only the Io1∗cos(φ1) component has useful physical meaning during the EF transient, while the Io1∗sin(φ1) component is just a disturbing part which can only cause the wrong operation of the protection. At the same time, for all higher harmonics phasors of the Io current the situation is exactly the opposite. The Ioh∗sin(φh) is the useful component with a clear physical meaning while the Ioh∗cos(φh) component is a disturbing part which can only upset the earth-fault measurement. In the proposed solution, only the two useful components are used. They are first integrated over short period of time deriving values proportional to the energy content of the two original signals. Only the positive or negative sign of these integrated values is then used in the design to determine the direction of the earth fault. Before being used for directionality check, the integrated value must also exceed the pre-set minimum threshold level, for security reasons."

The derivative-based traveling wave protection method exposes the problem of low-sensitivity when high-impedance faults occur. In this paper, the influence factors of the fault initial traveling wave are analysed and the analytic expressions of the fault initial traveling wave are derived. In the expression, the physical meaning of the exponent coefficients is the distortion degree of the fault initial traveling wave, which is related to the location of the fault. The exponent coefficients will not be influenced by the fault impedance. According to the formation of the expression, a basic fitting function is selected to extract fault location information from the zero-mode fault current initial traveling wave by Levenberg-Marquart fitting method. Then a high-speed protection scheme is proposed using the obtained fitting coefficients. The simulation results show that the fitting coefficients b can directly correspond to the fault location, the proposed method can reliably and fast identify faults and has high sensitivity when high-impedance faults occur."

In this paper, first, the nonlinear constraints of the original DNR problem are transformed into second-order cone programming constraints providing a convex formulation. Then, a new path-based methodology including mixed integer linear constraints for optimal reliability-oriented DNR is proposed. Therefore, this paper proposes a convex model for optimal DNR with the objective of 1) reliability indices improvement, and 2) energy loss minimisation. The proposed method is applied to a 135-bus power distribution system with five DG units and different scenarios for the objective function's terms are investigated.

Compared with gas insulated switchgear (GIS), GIL has a greater possibility of internal insulating gas leakage. In UHV GIL, the total amount of SF6 gas is up to about 750 tons. A small amount of gas leakage may cause power system fault, environmental pollution and even personal injury and death, It is necessary to improve the leakage rate index greatly and strictly control the gas leakage. In view of the requirement for extremely low gas leakage rate of UHV GIL, this paper proposes the method and key parameters of helium mass spectrometry vacuum leak detection. A helium mass spectrometry leak detection system with a length of 20 meters is applicated for the first time in the world. Through the research and comparison of the leak detection methods, two common air-tightness detection methods (local binding cover method and buckle cover method) were analyzed by experiment. Considering the detection efficiency and detection accuracy, a high-precision, quantifiable helium leak detection method combined with the SF6 partial buckle cover and fixed volume buckle cover is proposed in the type test and the factory test. The results show that SF6 annual leakage rate in GIL compartment is decreased from 0.5% to 0.01% and the minimum leak detection rate of the system reaches 1×10-8Pa m3/s. This study bcan provide a basis for further improving the gas leak detection efficiency in the future."

        "abstract": "Designing small and high-power density machines requires a good knowledge of the thermal behaviour in an early stage of the design process. As the end windings have a comparable long thermal path to the cooling medium, it is most likely the hottest component in an electrical machine. Therefore, it is essential to have a thermal model of the end windings in order to estimate the temperature distribution in it. In this paper, we present an analytical lumped-circuit approach for the thermal modeling of the end windings. We have applied the extended layer approach, which homogenises the stator slot considering four directions in predefined layers, and extended it in axial direction. With the extension in axial direction, we can simulate the heat flow and can predict a temperature distribution along the wires. We have implemented the approach for a tooth-coil winding, simulated and validated it with a Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The innermost layers in the end windings show the hottest temperature due to the longest thermal path to the cooling medium. For a defined load step, which equals the rated operating point in the observed driving cycle, the maximum temperatures differ by a maximum of 12:1K compared to the FEA results. The average and minimum temperatures differ by a maximum of 4:4K and 8:8K. In thermal steady-state, the temperatures differ by 9:5K, 0:8K and 8:8K for the maximum, average and minimum temperatures. Along the windings in axial direction the temperature difference for the average temperatures is given by 4:6K and 2:5K for the analytical approach. The validation with FEA results shows a good accordance to the analytical approach, while the simulation time is about 400 times faster."

The challenge however with this control is the tuning of the control parameters. Subsequently, this paper proposes a centralised control scheme based on system optimization to tune Q(U) control parameters. The optimization determines the optimal settings of the on-load tap changer (OLTC) and voltage regulator (VR), the voltage sensitivity with respect to reactive power and the optimal voltage values for the buses where DGs are integrated on an hourly basis. These sensitivity values are then used to tune and adjust the Q(U) control to regulate the voltage within a 15 minute interval. Thus, a coordinative voltage control scheme is achieved based on different timescales. This scheme when implemented on the United Kingdom generic 16 bus medium voltage distribution grid improved the voltage stability index as compared to the scenario where the DG operated with fixed Q(U) control parameters. Also, the scheme improved the voltage profile at the point of common coupling where the DGs were connected."

These static models represent cascading events as a series of discrete transitions, and ignore the temporal nature of the cascading outages. Therefore, they cannot capture the dynamic characteristics over different timescales. This work investigates and highlights the differences between a novel dynamic model and a conventional static model for cascading failure studies. N-2 contingency analysis is performed and the unserved demand and the number of line outages are used as metrics for quantifying the cascading effect. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to evaluate the impact of key parameters of the static cascading model on the potential risk of cascading failures. The application of the proposed methodology on the IEEE 39-bus systems shows that the two models can produce consistent data distribution and cascade patterns, but differences do exist. The results show the importance of carefully determining the generation and load dispatch capabilities when using static models."

We proposed a modified dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to discriminate six activities, those are walking, sitting down, standing up, picking up an object, drinking water, and falling, by combining both information of spectrogram inner structure and intensity distribution. Standard DTW for activity recognition usually employs spectrogram envelope as the input sequence and does not specifically consider the multi-dimensional characteristics of human activities. The Micro-Doppler spectrogram of human activities obtained by time-frequency analysis contains rich information such as motion intensity, direction and range. We first scale the intensity of spectrogram into 256 levels and then segment the scaled spectrogram into sequential vectors along time as the input of DTW distance matrix. In this way, both inner structure and intensity distribution of the spectrogram can be extracted and fully exploited. A K-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier is employed based on the DTW distance for further activity recognition. The experimental results using the given test dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method, exhibiting a recognition accuracy of 100% using full training dataset, and 97% for the dataset with test data discarded."

        "abstract": "SAR image ship detection has important applications in military and civil fields. With the wide application of deep learning in the field of computer vision, more and more SAR ship detection algorithms have applied deep learning. Neural network based on deep learning can automatically extract features instead of hand-crafted features, and has achieved great success. But the design of deep neural networks is time-consuming and complex, which need a lot of professional knowledge and experience. Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great potential in automated design networks. NAS can find the most suitable architecture on the specified dataset within a given search space. In object detection, the scale of the object varies, which is usually solved by designing feature fusion network. So in this work, we proposed to use differentiable architecture search to search the feature fusion module for SAR ship detection. The experiments on SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) showed that the discovered architecture can replace the corresponding part of the detection network with 1% performance improvement."

Current approaches rely on large power stations but as the industry moves to cleaner and more decentralised energy, new options must be developed. The expansion of DER and network flexibility presents an opportunity to develop a radically different approach to system restoration. Greater diversity in black start provision will improve resilience and increase competition leading to reductions in both cost and carbon emissions. However, there are significant technical, organisational and commercial challenges to address. The first stage of the project assessed the viability and requirements of delivering black start using DER."

        "abstract": "Safety critical applications like electric aircraft are in demand of high power densities and high reliabilities for electrical machines. These two design goals oppose each other. To keep the propulsion system available faults need to be detected early enough to limit the fault impact and keep the system operating. Electrical machines have plenty of fault possibilities. Such as a fault in the winding system. The winding systems fault with the highest probability for machines driven by a voltage source inverter is an inter-turn fault. This fault itself is not critical but the effect it causes usually leads to a phase to phase fault or phase to ground fault which then leads to a shut-down of the machine in any case. This paper focuses on temperature development caused by an inter-turn fault as it determines the requirements for fault management systems. We show that a small fault power of less then 10% of the overall losses leads to a critical situation of the machine, starting from the nominal operating point. Additional losses of 25W reduce the lifetime from more than 20000 h to 100 h. A fault power of 1:25W reduces the life-time by a half. Further we show that the location of the fault has a limited impact on the machine."

        "abstract": "In the residential sector, electric water heaters are appliances with a relatively high power consumption and a significant thermal inertia, which is particularly suitable for Demand Response (DR) schemes. The success of efficient DR schemes via the control of water heaters presupposes an accurate estimate of their power demand at each instant. Although the load of water heaters is rarely directly measured, a large penetration of Smart Meters (SMs) in distribution grids enables to indirectly infer this information on a large scale via load disaggregation. For that purpose, a considerable number of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) approaches are suggested in the literature. However, they require data streams at a time resolution in the range of one second or higher, which is not realistic for standard SMs. Hence, this paper proposes an unsupervised approach to detect and disaggregate the load profile of water heaters from standard SM data with a time resolution in the minute range. Evaluated on multiple real loads with sub-metering, the proposed approach achieves a Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) lower than 2% and a precision generally higher than 92% with time resolutions between 5 and 15 minutes."

In addition, it is demonstrated that threshold voltage (VTH) rather than gate inductance is important factor of the device for suppression of current deviation. We fabricate 3-parallel connected GaN bidirectional switch with the same VTH. The Ron of 9.3 mOmega and the maximum current of 390 A are attained in this device.

In practical application, the output voltage as well as the output power will fluctuate irregularly when the spatial positions of loads changes randomly. To deal with this issue, a control strategy employing pulse density modulation (PDM) under different switching frequencies is proposed in the sending or receiving side for multi-load MCR WPT system to realize constant output voltage at loads under varying spatial misalignments. In this paper, a double-frequency double-load MCR WPT system is investigated as an example, and the equivalent circuit model is built and analyzed. The detailed implementation of PDM control is presented, and the experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical analysis and proposed methods."

Because of the increased heat conductivity and low thermal expansion properties of cement-based materials they are potential candidates for further enhancement of reliability properties or miniaturization approaches. For a defined material design of these encapsulation materials multiple variations of the cement compositions, as well as different filler materials or filler contents are available, resulting in a wide range of available material properties after the hydration process. In order to allow a target-oriented material design, a microstructural and reliability driven simulation approach is presented. Therefore, the influence of the microstructure composition related to major engineering properties is studied by numerical approaches. In addition, the influence of the cement encapsulation on typical failure modes of an “Econo3” power module under power cycling conditions was analyzed and compared to common silicone gel encapsulation. The analyzed failure modes include bond wire fatigue, solder fatigue and fracture modes related to chip- or substrate failure. In order to verify the outcomes of the finite element modelling, also the local load distribution using these new encapsulation materials was compared exemplarily with finding from destructive failure analysis like cross sections of the solder interface and bond wires."

It’s a case study of 1st HVDC project that is in construction phase in Pakistan. The Project is Parallel ±660kV LCC HVDC transmission Links to transmit Bulk amount of Power from south to North of the country. As the rectifier converter station of two transmission line are very close to each other, commutation failure on inverter side AC system of any transmission line causes TOV issues on rectifier side AC system of both Transmission lines. PSCAD based model is designed to study the steady states and transient states (TOV and Commutation Failure) of the system. The main focus of the study is to understand when a commutation failure is occurred at inverter side AC system then how it will affect the TOV at both rectifier side AC systems and how the variation of SCR at rectifiers of both transmission lines reduce the TOV issues. By the simulation based study of PSCAD model it’s found that commutation failure at inverter side of AC system of transmission line 1 or transmission line 2 has a prominent effect on the Transient over Voltage issues of rectifier side AC system of both lines. Similarly it is observed that by keeping the SCR at rectifier side AC system of one transmission line constant and increasing the SCR at rectifier side of ac system of other transmission lines much reduces the transient over voltage issues."

Advanced modelling and analytical capabilities are required from distribution planning tools to understand the full potential of smart inverters. This study presents enhanced smart inverter modelling and simulation features included in a recent release of the open-source distribution system modelling and simulation software suite OpenDSS. The enhanced features include detailed modelling of the inverter capability curve along with significant improvements to the simulation speed and convergence. The enhanced features make it more practical to perform long quasi-static time-series load flow simulations with thousands of time steps on large-scale utility feeder models with up to thousands of autonomously controlled smart inverters. Some of the enhanced speed, convergence and other features are demonstrated on a large-scale real U.S. utility feeder model with >1100 solar photovoltaic systems."

Considering the characteristics of small scale and few features of radar targets, the original YOLOv3 backbone network is pruned and nonlinear features are added, and the Darknet13 network structure is proposed. The multiple outputs of the Darknet13 network are fused in two scale, deep fusion is used to detect large-scale targets, and shallow fusion is used to detect small-scale targets. In order to solve the problem of imbalance between positive and negative samples of radar data, the focus loss function is used to strengthen the attention to the hard to distinguish samples. Meanwhile, warm up technology is used to optimize the learning rate adjustment strategy to improve the target detection performance and network training speed. The experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOv3 algorithm, the proposed method can improve the average detection rate by 8.4% and reduce the average false alarm rate by 79.8% when the signal-to-noise ratio is 10 dB."

The IoT applications have been in constant development in recent years, making it very difficult to find an industry that had zero influences from IoT solutions. A few examples include: Smart Homes, which can be derived from its name as many different devices that are commonly found in your home such as, fridge and lights, are all connected to the internet and can be easily accessed through your phone. Furthermore, although smart parking systems currently exist, however most of them have minimal features, such as if the park is occupied or free. As such, a smarter parking system could be developed by developing an IoT system (Al-Hamami, 2017). The proposed Smart Parking System in this research is an addition on existing smart parking systems by introducing actual smart features, such as preventing drivers to hit-and-run, occupying multiple parking spaces and parking in spaces for people with special needs. A prototype has been developed using Raspberry Pi 3, Sensors and Python language, to prove the concept successfully. The prototype is now able to react and interact differently in each different situation and creating a new open environment for parking system where many custom enhancements and developments can be integrated easily. A survey was also conducted to identify the possible problems of a typical parking lots especially in major shopping malls. This research will ultimately ease the parking not only for users but also for the shop owners by making parking management easier to manage and control."

To acquire robust coherent detection, this paper proposes Radon inverse Fourier transform (RIFT). In this paper, we focus on the fact in fast frequency-slow frequency domain that the echo of the target is characterized as a unique straight line whose location simply corresponds to the velocity. Benefiting from this fact, the velocity can be estimated through velocity searching via RIFT, in which the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) is exploited along the velocity-related straight line. Then, we can conduct the CI employing RIFT with the estimated velocity. In comparison with keystone transform (KT) and Radon-Fourier transform (RFT), the advantages of RIFT are as follows: low computational complexity, no interpolation loss as well as the blind speed sidelobe (BSSL) simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed RIFT. Specifically, the proposed algorithm yields 2dB better antinoise performance than scaled inverse Fourier transform (SCIFT) and frequency-domain deramp-keystone transform (FDDKT) in the high-speed target detections."

This function takes account of the adopted low-voltage-ride-through curve, as well as the relevant requirements concerning consecutive low-voltage disturbances. In this regard, it can preserve low-voltage-ride through operation, concurrently preventing an excessive network energization by the generator. The designed function is described in detail, while, it is modelled using MATLAB/Simulink. Furthermore, it is tested by simulating different kinds of consecutive low-voltage disturbance events."

Firstly, the dynamic environment information and static environment information are processed. The VGG-16 network and Bi-LSTM are used to realize the feature extraction and fusion of comprehensive environmental information.

Information technology systems (ITS) for fuel control are currently facing interoperability problems in pump stations due to the carelessness or neglecting of some drivers which cause fuel spill squinted on the ground. This paper proposes a new idea with new processes for fuel-saving, by installing a WSN operated with the Internet of Things (IoT) scheme. The WSN, mounted in the tank of the vehicle, will sense the level of fuel and filling percentage and help the pumping machine to fill the tank with the capacity required not to exceed the maximum capacity of the tank.

While this work think only detect the engagement level is not enough, we also need to consider how to actual use it in onlinelearning platform. To this end, we first introduce the balanced random forest model to solve the classification task, then a method based on forest model is designed to find its local explanation (ie. why the student is disengaged). We think the local explanation can provide a reference for lecturers or platforms to improve the learners' learning experience. The system is tested through DAiSEE dataset. The final F1-score reaches to 0.809 for detector. We then compare our local explanation with LIME[1], the top 5 result are almost the same.

The high-frequency resonant converter has the advantages of constant charging current and strong anti-load short-circuit capability when used for capacitor charging, which is very suitable for charging high-voltage pulse capacitors. In this paper, through the mathematical analysis of the steady-state working process of a series resonant charging power supply working in discontinuous current mode, the change law and peak characteristics of resonance current, resonance capacitor voltage, load capacitor charging voltage and charging current, and average charging current are obtained. It is proved that the series resonant power supply has inherent constant current charging characteristics, and the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by simulation calculation. Finally, a series resonant power supply with a resonant capacitor of 32μF, a resonant inductor of 208μH, a resonant frequency of 2kHz, a charging voltage of 10kv, and a charging time of 0.2s is designed. The measured results of the power supply are basically consistent with the calculated results."

For the gate unit, the cathode current commutation relies on the energy stored in the turning-off capacitor stack. In order to achieve the reliable turning-off and increase the turning-off capability, some methods can be done, such as: reducing the parasitic parameter of the turning-off circuit, selecting the electronic components with lower parasitic parameters, and increasing the gate cathode reverse voltage. But these methods are always limited, and the lifetime issue of electrolytic capacitors of turning-off circuit is a key factor which affects the life of IGCT. So based on the principle of IGCT, this paper proposes a novel turning-off circuit to ensure that the capacitance of the turning-off capacitor is extremely little under the same turning-off current, and it can fully guarantee the off state of IGCT. It is important to reduce the volume of the device, enhance the lifetime of the product, and extend application areas."

Considerations related to an optimization of the PCB concern the EMI problems that are of high interest especially in the automotive field where it can be included the application object of this study.

This paper presents results of a DC test on a complete stator made with the same settings of the resin trickle impregnation process. The stator was instrumented with a number of temperature sensors at various locations. A large variation in winding temperature from tooth to tooth is shown. It correlates to the variation in the impregnation goodness of the segments as expected. However, the calibrated lumped parameter thermal network model from the motorette tests failed to predict accurately the transient behaviour of the stator during the DC tests. An improved thermal model is presented accounting for the resin heat capacity and the actual resin weight in the stator during the calibration, leading to more accurate transient simulations."

The signal model of time-domain frequency diversity MIMO radar is established. Then, by exploiting the idea of range compensation in the frequency diversity array space-time adaptive processing (FDA-STAP), a slow target detection method is given by using a priori range cell information. Simulation results indicate that the frequency step between pulses can separate the slow target from the main clutter area, which is beneficial to the detection of slow targets.

Then, the coarse mesh is iteratively refined using the expectation maximization algorithm, and the estimated angle is the root of a certain polynomial. Simulation results show that the method has higher estimation accuracy and lower computational complexity in DOA estimation of passive radar. In addition, this method can not only estimate the DOA of multi-target signals in a single snapshot, but also provide new ideas for DOA estimation of coherent signals."

This paper presents a novel one-bit method for detecting moving targets in SAR images. The proposed method is applied to the signal after dechirp processing. Based on the one-bit quantization, the method introduces a static frequency offset to the original signal, which decreases the spectrum interference of the higher harmonics. In addition, combined with displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) technique, the moving targets are effectively detected after compensation of the two channel one-bit SAR images. Finally, compared with the straightforward one-bit sampling scheme, the efficiency of the proposed method and the relevant conclusion are verified by the simulation results."

        "abstract": "The expansion of renewable energies and the resulting decentralization of the electricity production poses major challenges for electricity grids. A solution approach for this problem is the creation of self-sufficient (island mode) microgrids. Since the electricity required in such a microgrid is primarily produced and consumed locally (up to 100 %), less electricity has to be transported over long distances via cables. However, the goal of keeping the degree of selfsufficiency of a microgrid reliably on a high level turns out to be a difficult task due to various constraints such as the composition of the local electricity production or the additional consideration of electric vehicles. In order to address this problem, this paper presents a two-step optimization methodology which allows to increase the degree of selfsufficiency of a microgrid based on a composition of local power plants, consumers and electric vehicles. To implement the methodology, two Computational Intelligence (CI) metaheuristics are applied and compared: Simulated Annealing (SA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). On the basis of an example scenario as well as extensive, aggregated test runs, the results show that the proposed methodology is capable of reliably increasing the degree of self-sufficiency of a microgrid."

For the detection of small targets with long range and slow velocity in the background of strong clutter, the conventional pulse-Doppler (PD) radar is limited by range ambiguity and folded clutter. It is feasible to solve this problem through the agility between pulses. In this paper, a non-repeating, spectrum modulated nonlinear frequency modulation (NLFM) waveform applicable for pulse agility radar is described. Based on the spectrum structure of linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal, the waveform modulates its power spectral density by a random sinusoid to achieve good cross-correlation properties, which can suppress the range ambiguity and folded clutter. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

The jammer generates a specific single frequency time-varying signal according to the offset of predesigned false points. By comparing the echo data with the time-varying threshold signal, it is quantized into 1-bit sampling data. The 1-bit data is modulated by the false target template, and then retransmitted to the radar, so as to achieve multi-false-target deceptive jamming. Compared with the conventional deceptive jamming, the proposed method can simplify the calculation complexity and improve the efficiency of the jammer. Through the simulation experiment, the focusing quality of the false target is analysed and the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified."

The radar system provides a complementary input when the visible light cannot work. It can effectively tackle darkness, occlusion, and non-line-of sight conditions. The frequency modulation induced by the micromotion of human movements can be captured and utilized by radar systems. Currently, the integration of deep learning methods and classical signal processing has been more and more prominent in the radar-based human behaviour sensing field. In this work, we propose a compact deep learning model to classify various human activities by the corresponding frequency modulation. Considering most deep neural networks are both data-hungry and resource-hungry, we integrate transfer learning and network pruning techniques to reduce the number of labelled training samples and computational burden. The experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms convolutional neural networks trained from scratch but also significantly slims its model size and computing operations."

In this paper, a protection scheme based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK to detect the faults in the microgrid. The input voltage of the proposed scheme is first transformed into dq0 frame using the Park Transform. A filtering system based on the wavelet denoising approach is then implemented to reduce the sampling frequency and reject the switching noise generated by the inverters in the microgrid. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in transient simulation by systematically applying different types of faults, including varied fault positions and impedances. Additionally, a high impedance arcing fault model is implemented to test the proposed protection scheme under nonlinear fault impedance conditions."

Manually disease detection requires enormous amount of work, and also requires the too much processing time, therefore image processing play important role for the detection of crop plant diseases. The proposed method automatic segment and classify different leaf disease regions from the plant images. The proposed method works on three steps: In the first step, pre-processing is applied on the plant image that be made of median filter and contrast stretching in order to remove the digitization noise and enhance the contrast of the image, respectively. In the second step, K-means clustering algorithm is employed on L*a*b* color model of leaf image that segments pixels into uniform sets. These segments then are converted into HSV color model and the segment that has maximum hue value among other segments are extracted as a disease segment. Finally, feature are extracted from disease segment and apply machine learning i.e. Multi SVM classifier to classify crop image into various class based on various diseases on crop images. Proposed technique is implemented on Matlab 14a.To conduct the experiments on different plant image we have used various crop disease images from various source. Accuracy of our proposed system is approx. 86.67%. Keywords:"

        "abstract": "Today, distribution system hosting capacity studies for distributed solar photovoltaics (PVs) and other distributed energy resources (DERs) are based on worst-case scenarios that assume DERs operate in unmanaged or unconstrained ways. Under the current paradigm, DER hosting capacity can be limited or costly grid upgrades may be required due to potential, but infrequent, worst-case conditions. DER management systems (DERMS) can enable additional DER to be interconnected as a managed resource that is curtailed to avoid violations under the infrequent worst-case conditions. This scheme, referred to as flexible interconnection, allows the interconnection of more DER while resulting in a minimal reduction in productivity to DER owners. This study assesses the techno-economic value of flexible interconnection for PV enabled by DERMS through detailed modelling and analysis of a real North American distribution feeder. It focuses on using DERMS to avoid distribution system upgrades due to thermal overloads and illustrates the economic value of a flexible interconnection arrangement across a range of PV system capacities. Findings indicate that the value of a flexible interconnection arrangement diminishes for PV systems with larger DC/AC ratios and as interconnected PV capacity increases, given increased amounts of curtailment."

The infection rate spikes due to unprotected contact with people with fever or respiratory symptoms. Fever is one of the common symptoms of corona virus infection. Thus, measuring the body temperature and tracing its change is an important indicator. It is a recommended practice to inspect suspected cases. For campuses with big number of residents and visitors, monitoring the temperature arises a new challenge as it requires huge number of trained medical staff and imposes the direct contact between the medical staff and the person under test. Also, this practice requires the direct contact between the medical staff and the person under test, which may cause the transmission of the virus. In this paper a non-contact autonomous smart thermometer system is proposed. The thermometer measures forehead temperature remotely, without the need for human operation. The system indicates the person identity and records the measured temperature enabling the tracing of temperature of engaged persons and further analysis of gathered data. In this paper, the system architecture and the implementation of the proposed system is described. Testing and verification processes demonstrate its effectiveness and feasibility."

Linear state estimation based on PMU can better reflect the current state of the system. However, PMU error is a key issue for the accurate linear state estimation. While, the true values of PMU measurements and the real states of power system are all unavailable. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate performances of the state estimation results in a practical power system. This article proposes a method of applying nonparametric estimation to the measurement error analysis of PMU. Through the PMU measurement data from the power system simulation platform, the unimodal PMU voltage measurement error and the bimodal PMU current measurement error are obtained. For dealing with evaluating power system state estimation, an approach of evaluating state estimation results by support vector machine (SVM) without the real value is presented. The feasibility of this method is verified in a simulation of IEEE 14 and 118 node system."

Even though, the time lag between fault time and GS triggering time is as long as 60ms. In this long time lag, the sub_module (SM) voltage will be charged up to 4270V, which is very danger for IGBT. The solution of distributed dissipation resistor installed in SM is proposed in this paper and recommended values were also given out. Simulation works based on PSCAD are conducted to verify this method. The simulation results show that the proposed solution is valid."

        "abstract": "Based on the fact that the servo motor control requires high reliability of resolver, this paper studies the fault diagnosis mechanism based on the integrated resolver decoder chip AD2S1210, and conclude that the excitation, sine, cosine signal and the fault output signals are susceptible when used for fault diagnosis which leads to a high false alarm rate. At the same time, the disturbance of the decoded value may cause a certain deviation in the detection of the resolver position when a false alarm occurs, which directly affects the accuracy of the servo motor control. From the perspective of application, this paper proposes a resolver fault diagnosis and position synthesis algorithm based on information fusion and model prediction. Based on the AD2S1210 fault detection, this algorithm uses information fusion and model prediction methods to detect resolver faults and predict position so as to reduce the position fluctuations when a false alarm occurs. The algorithm is simulated and then tested on an experimental system. The test data is compared with the fault diagnosis data based on AD2S1210 fault detection before the improvement. The results show that: after executing the algorithm, the false alarm rate is reduced to a certain extent, and the position meanwhile is smoother than before. This algorithm does not need additional system hardware cost, and can also be realized and integrated in the motor control software. The software consumes less resources and has higher engineering application value."

As the novel sensorless control strategy estimate the rotor position by using different harmonics, it can lead to a good torque response compared to the classical strategy, specially in transient states. Therefore, in order to define the appropriate sensorless control strategy for the non-sinusoidal seven-phase PMSM, each sensorless control strategy will be highlighted in terms of robustness to the speed variation and torque ripple. Simulation results will be shown to verify the feasibility of the proposed methods."

        "abstract": "For moving target detection with space-based array radar systems, the discrete side-lobe clutter caused by the isolated scatters or the moving scatters at antenna side-lobe direction, such as ships, small islands, buildings, power poles of the towers, and etc., usually has large power due to the wide antenna beams and shares the similar Doppler features with the real moving targets in the antenna main-lobe beam. The discrete side-lobe clutter cannot be well suppressed by using the space-time adaptive processing (STAP) and thus to result in false alarms. To address the issue, an orthogonal projection filter is deigned to suppress the discrete side-lobe clutter for space-based radar systems. In this method, the “potential targets”, including the real moving targets and the discrete side-lobe clutter, are firstly pre-selected after the STAP. Then, for the range-Doppler cells of the potential targets, the corresponding orthogonal projection filters are designed based on the differences of the space-time steering vectors between the discrete side-lobe clutter and the real moving targets. After applying the filters, the power of the discrete side-lobe clutter can be reduced significantly, while that of the real moving targets would change little, making it available to eliminate the false alarms. Finally, the theoretical analysis and the airborne radar experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The temperature dependence of the quasi-threshold voltage is used in this paper to measure the device temperature. To analyse the temperature behaviour of the quasi-threshold voltage in gallium-nitride transistors, static measurements are performed. A gallium-nitride transistor with a rating of 600 V/26 A in half bridge configuration is used for the dynamic measurements. The voltage drop across the parasitic inductance between power and Kelvin source is used to trigger the data acquisition circuit which also prevents false triggering while keeping low noise susceptibility. The novelty of this paper lies in the successful implementation of this robust and easy-to-implement method to measure temperatures of Gallium-Nitride power devices."

        "abstract": "The uncertain output of renewable energy requires the power system to have flexible adjustment ability, which is called as flexibility. However, current research on power system flexibility planning mainly focuses on power supply configuration and rarely considers the flexibility of line planning. Because of it, this paper proposes a joint planning method of transmission channel and energy storage system considering the dual objectives of economy and flexibility. The model adopts a two-layer optimization model. The upper layer takes the optimal economy and flexibility as the goal, which decides the line planning scheme; while the lower layer is optimized for operational economy, determining the power system scheduling strategy, and returns the results to the upper layer. The model is solved by the NSGA2 optimization algorithm, so the multi-objective optimization is achieved. On this basis, a method of constructing renewable energy output scenes according to fluctuation randomness is proposed, which provides data basis for the planning optimization model. Finally, the method is simulated in the power grid with high proportion of renewable energy to verify the effectiveness."

The proposed strategy aims to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing a predetermined the mean-square error (MSE) threshold for target location position and velocity estimation, which is evaluated by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). In order to solve the underlying optimization problem, a Two-Step technique, which exploits the heuristic algorithm and the semidefinite programming (SDP) method, is introduced. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the developed Two-Step solution algorithm has much higher efficiency when compared with the exhaustive search approach, and the presented strategy can also provide superiority over other existing schemes in terms of the achievable LPI performance."

The performance of traditional SEI technique based on expert knowledge and hand-crafted emitter features is limited in engineering, since the designing of features is essentially subject to a certain application scenario and radio environment. To provide a universal SEI method, this paper proposes a novel strategy using adaptive feature generation and deep learning architecture. In particular, the technique of empirical mode decomposition is performed on the non-stationary received signal, and further converted into a grey-scale image. Then a convolutional neural network is applied for feature extraction and emitter identification. In the experiment, we first build a dataset with same intermediate frequency tone signals from four identical Keysight E8267D signal sources with different output power. Then the performance of the proposed method is studied on this dataset, the results indicate that our method is effective for emitter identification."
