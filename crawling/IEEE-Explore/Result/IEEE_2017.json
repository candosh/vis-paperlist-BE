        "abstract": "In this work, we present an algebraic solution to the classical perspective-3-point (P3P) problem for determining the position and attitude of a camera from observations of three known reference points. In contrast to previous approaches, we first directly determine the cameras attitude by employing the corresponding geometric constraints to formulate a system of trigonometric equations. This is then efficiently solved, following an algebraic approach, to determine the unknown rotation matrix and subsequently the cameras position. As compared to recent alternatives, our method avoids computing unnecessary (and potentially numerically unstable) intermediate results, and thus achieves higher numerical accuracy and robustness at a lower computational cost. These benefits are validated through extensive Monte-Carlo simulations for both nominal and close-to-singular geometric configurations."

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a large number of heterogeneous and pervasive objects that continuously generate information about the physical world. These objects, through standard communication protocols and unique addressing schemes provide services to the final users or systems. IoT is envisioned to bring together billions of devices, also denoted as smart objects, by connecting them in an Internet-like structure, allowing them to communicate and exchange information and to enable new forms of interaction among things and people. Given the distributed nature of IoT applications, it is often the case that the application is modeled, developed and tested on each compute node, and connected to other nodes in the application network for achieving the end result. Therefore the deployment of application is also, more or less, done on each individual compute node. In this paper we propose an approach where the IoT application can be modeled in one place, where after modeling, the different pieces of application are annotated with location information, and based on this annotation, the application is decomposed into fragments that are deployed to corresponding individual compute nodes, automatically generating code to remotely connect the application fragments to other application fragments on other compute nodes in the edge or in the cloud."

Here it is shown how these spectral notches can be used to permit radar operation in a band where narrowband interference sources are present. The impact of interference and associated notches in different regions of the waveform spectrum (i.e. passband versus roll-off regions) is examined through assessment of the matched filter response when considering different receive power levels for the radar relative to measured interference. This assessment is performed for both simulated and experimentally measured notched waveforms."

This paper studies the area coverage problem (ACP) with non-penetrable obstacles in microgrids, where a sensor cannot be deployed or sensing signals cannot pass through. The target coverage region is discretized in a deployment map representation of non-penetrable obstacles. A probability detection model is utilized to represent sensors with variable distance coverage. The ACP is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and an iterative process is developed to solve the problem. The microgrid at Illinois Institute of Technology (IL Tech) is used as a practical example. Both the normal and the N-1 contingency deployments of sensors are simulated for optimizing the ACP at the IL Tech Microgrid."

PTV Vissim, the worlds leading microscopic traffic simulation tool, provides a virtual testbed to evaluate the coexistence of autonomous and conventional vehicles either in the transition phase or when vehicle fleets are fully autonomous. Vissim traffic simulation is increasingly being employed to address the evidence gap around the potential impacts of disruptive technologies, such as connected autonomous vehicles, on traffic flow and capacity. Incorporating hardware in the loop testing allows detailed representation of autonomous vehicle control algorithms, sensor and communication protocols to be simulated within a realistic virtual traffic environment. Simulating varying penetration rates of autonomous vehicles, and different behavioral characteristics such as as platooning, vehicle to vehicle communication and vehicle to infrastructure communication, has demonstrated the opportunity to reduce travel times by 11% and delays by more than 40%."

Furthermore, the definition of a quiet zone (QZ) having amplitude taper of less than 1 dB, amplitude ripple of less than ±0.5 dB in amplitude and ±5° in phase has become a near universal standard both in academia and industry [1]. However, this almost omnipresent usage belies the fact that surprisingly few workers are familiar with what this implies for an actual antenna pattern measurement. The recent development of a novel computational electromagnetic (CEM) simulation tool that permits the simulation of \"measured\" far-field pattern data for a known CATR and test antenna combination [2] permits the careful examination of the behaviour of these three conventional CATR QZ specifications on \"measured\" far-field patterns for a given test antenna. Results are presented and discussed."

Several circuit breaker topologies have been developed for fill this purpose [1][2][3]. In this paper, a mechanical active resonant current zero topology DC breaker, capable of interrupting fault current within several milliseconds after tripping, is analysed. In this topology, it is critical that the mechanical interrupter unit is capable of withstanding both high di/dt prior to current zero and high dv/dt post current zero. The high frequency interruption capabilities of gas circuit breaker (GCB) and vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) are examined to assess their use for mechanical DC breaker applications. Comparison of the maximum di/dt capabilities demonstrated that vacuum interrupters are more appropriate for the task. The concept of residual plasma density at current zero was evaluated to explain the relationship between breaking current and di/dt capability."

        "abstract": "Massive MIMO is the currently most compelling sub-6 GHz wireless access technology for 5G. Since its inception about a decade ago, it has evolved from a wild “academic” idea to one of the most vibrant research topics in the wireless communications community, as well as a main work item in 5G standardization. The concept is to equip base stations with arrays of many antennas that serve many terminals simultaneously, in the same time-frequency resource. The arrays have attractive form factors: in the 2 GHz band, a halfwave-length-spaced rectangular array with 200 dual-polarized elements is about 1.5 × 0.75 meters large. Massive MIMO operates in TDD mode and the downlink beamforming exploits the uplink-downlink reciprocity of radio propagation. Specifically, the base station array uses channel estimates obtained from uplink pilots transmitted by the terminals to learn the channel in both directions. This makes Massive MIMO entirely scalable with respect to the number of base station antennas. Base stations operate autonomously, with no sharing of payload data or channel state information with other cells. In this talk I will discuss the development of Massive MIMO over the last five years, and outline the most important research problems ahead."

We use an extended TAM consisting of 9 constructs. A questionnaire is distributed to a total of 107 college English teachers from seven institutions of higher learning in South China. The results confirm that the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are key variables that positively influence teachers' intension to use mobile technologies. Self-efficacy is also found to be significantly related to teachers' behavior intention in using mobile devices in their classroom followed by the factor of mobile anxiety.

        "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a new methodology for the simulation of Power Line Communication (PLC) within the popular Electromagnetic Transients Programme-Alternative Transients Programme (EMTP-ATP). As a first application, the comparative performance of the emerging Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based Prime and G3-PLC narrowband standards is investigated. Models of both standards have been created within the EMTPATP and simulations performed using frequency dependent line models and realistic transformer models as terminations. It is observed that both standards are severely affected by the highly frequency selective nature of the MV power line channel and a more considered choice of OFDM parameters may be necessary for optimal performance on MV networks."

This is just the tip of the iceberg as we are entering the age of the “zero-accident car” with autonomous driving based on wireless and wired networks of powerful sensors (potentially including intelligent tires) and complex control algorithms implemented on a distributed computing platform. The key to this brave new world is the continuous evolution of the sensor component of the car electrical architecture. We will discuss the sensor design and manufacturing challenges to bring autonomous cars on the street. Albeit significant steps have been made in the technology base that sustains autonomous driving, massive algorithmic and integration problems loom here."

The research targets applications in self-powered chip sets for use in public health, ambient intelligence, safety and security and IoT. ACE4S is the first SRC center of excellence outside the US. One such application, which we will discuss in details, is a ground breaking self-powered IoT SoC platform for wearable health care. More specifically we will present a novel fully integrated ECG signal processing system for the prediction of ventricular arrhythmia using a unique set of ECG features extracted from two consecutive cardiac cycles. Two databases of the heart signal recordings from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the MIT PhysioNet were used as training, test and validation sets to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The system achieved an accuracy of 99%. The ECG signal is sensed using a flexible, dry, Graphene-based technology and the system is powered up by harvesting human thermal energy. The system architecture is implemented in Global foundries' 65 nm CMOS process, occupies 0.112 mm2 and consumes 2.78 micro Watt at an operating frequency of10 KHz and from a supply voltage of 1.2V. To our knowledge, this is the first SoC implementation of an ECG-based processor that is capable of predicting ventricular arrhythmia hours before the onset and with an accuracy of 99%."

The patch antenna size extension method is employed to improve the tolerance in fabrication with low cost printed circuit board (PCB) etching process. Initially, the designing concept is analysed at 10GHz frequency and then the optimized high gain (~21dBi) array is fabricated and tested at 60GHz-band (57.24-65.88GHz). It has been found that the loss contribution due to the long feeding transmission line (TL) network in large MPAAs severely degrades the antenna gain when thick substrate is deployed. However, by employing relatively thinner substrate gain can be significantly enhanced in large arrays but cost has to be paid in terms of narrower return loss (S11) bandwidth (BW) and higher side lobe level (SLL). Finally, the optimized MPAA has been redesigned at 100GHz frequency on a thin PCB substrate and a good relation has been achieved between the antenna results obtained at 100GHz and 60GHz frequencies."

Deep convolutional neural networks are being regarded today as an extremely effective and flexible approach for extracting actionable, high-level information from the wealth of raw data produced by a wide variety of sensory data sources. CNNs are however computationally demanding: today they typically run on GPU-accelerated compute servers or high-end embedded platforms. Industry and academia are racing to bring CNN inference (first) and training (next) within ever tighter power envelopes, while at the same time meeting real-time requirements. Recent results, including our PULP and ORIGAMI chips, demonstrate there is plenty of room at the bottom: pj/OP (GOPS/mW) computational efficiency, needed for deploying CNNs in the mobile/wearable scenario, is within reach. However, this is not enough: 1000x energy efficiency improvement, within a mW power envelope and with low-cost CMOS processes, is required for deploying CNNs in the most demanding CPS scenarios. The fj/OP milestone will require heterogeneous (3D) integration with ultra-efficient die-to-die communication, mixed-signal pre-processing, event-based approximate computing, while still meeting real-time requirements."

Understanding human cognition and behavior is essential for any information system, in particular in emerging fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, and Robotics, etc. Cognitive sciences involve studies on information systems, which obviously include humans, by examining what we can do (i.e., performances), what we cannot do (i.e., limits), what we are good or bad at (i.e., species-specific characteristics), and the extent to which we can change (plasticity). As cognitive science is interdisciplinary by its nature and the ranges of interests and issues vary, setting several must-follow principles would be vital; here I would list just several ones for handling human cognition and action: experimental attitude, complexity appreciation, appropriate reductionism, evolutional perspective, and understanding dynamically changing systems. Then, I shall discuss some important aspects of human cognition and action by showing visual demonstrations and discuss four issues in cognitive sciences. Bottom-up process versus Top-down process: Human cognition and actions are based on various automatic, stimulus-driven processes as well as deliberative, internally-driven processes. Although it is often difficult to disentangle these two processes, it is a good strategy to examine to what extent a phenomenon at hand is based on bottom-up processes and top-down processes. Interaction between Perception & Action: What we perceive is not necessarily identical to what we act on. Sometimes, perception and action are dissociable and sometimes they interact. Due to these dissociable and interacting bottom-up and top-down processes and the relationship between perceptual and action, we experience the complex mixture of conscious and unconscious effects."

The concept is based on separating leverage measurements from non-leverage measurements by a technique called diagnostic robust generalized potential (DRGP), which also takes care of the masking or swamping effect, if any. The methodology then detects the erroneous measurements from the generalized studentized residuals (GSR). The effectiveness of the method is validated with a small illustrative example, standard IEEE 14-bus and 123-bus unbalanced network models and compared with the existing methods. The method is demonstrated to be potentially very useful to detect attacks in smart power grid targeting leverage points in the system."

BQYSI has advantages of continuous input current and bidirectional power flow. The proposed inverter is controlled to drive an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) for electric vehicle applications. A finite control set model predictive controller (FCS-MPC) is designed to select directly the inverter switching state based on minimum torque and flux error without modulation technique. The output voltage and current of the BQYSI are controlled to determine the shoot through duty cycle. Simulation results are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy under motoring and regenerating operating conditions."

        "abstract": "The peer-to-peer transmission is a mainstream in challenged network environments. Yet, the free rider phenomenon in peer-to peer transmissions presses a need for incentive mechanisms to stimulate contributions of data transmission. As a result, it is imperative to answer the questions: whether and to what extent an incentive mechanism can invoke such contributions? To answer these questions, we employ an n-player continuous quantum game model to analyze extrinsic incentive mechanisms (promoting cooperative behaviors by offering rewards), and use the quantum prisoner's dilemma model to analyze intrinsic incentive mechanisms (encouraging reciprocal cooperation by exploiting internal bounds). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to analyze incentive mechanisms for peer-to-peer transmissions from a quantum game perspective. Such a perspective is adopted because the extended strategy space in the quantum game broadens the range for searching optimal strategies and the introduction of entanglement makes the proposed analytical frameworks more practical due to the consideration of the peers' relationships in decision-making. Our proposed quantum game-based analytical frameworks are generic because they are compatible with classic game-based schemes. Our analytical results can provide straightforward insights on evaluating the potential of incentive mechanisms and can serve as important references for designing new incentive mechanisms."

In this study, we propose an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model learned by heuristic algorithms to predict the power outputs obtained from PV panels monthly. It has been seen that ANN trained by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are more successful than methods trained by the Back-Propagation(BP) and Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA) for prediction of the power outputs obtained from PV panels placed at six different tilt angles."

Firstly, a greedy construction heuristic is used to construct an initial solution, and then a local search algorithm is used to improve the solution. In addition, some improvements are made in some phases of the algorithm according to the feature of rebalancing problem. Practice examples and comparison with the typical algorithm in the fields are made. The results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and it can produce good results.

One important converter in a MG with master-slave configuration is the grid-forming converter (GFC) that generates a reference in voltage and frequency for islanded operation. A failure of GFC can jeopardize the MG operation. This paper presents one analysis of an AC MG in islanded mode composed by a new configuration of GFC formed by three single-phase full-bridge inverters connected in delta with a zigzag transformer to form a fourwire system. The main results show that even under a failure of one inverter, the GFC can operate in open-delta and the MG continues operating without any power quality (PQ) problems."

Malignant brain tumors have become one of the major causes of human death in recent years. If the tumor can be classified correctly at an early stage, the chances of survival of patients can be improved. The most appropriate treatment to be selected for brain cancer depends on precisely identifying of tumor type, location, size and boundaries by the physicians. Thus, it is important using a computer-aid ed diagnosis / detection system to detect brain tumors successfully for radiologists and physicians. In this study, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Otsu's method, Region Growing and Self-Organizing Maps methods is used for the automatic segmentation of brain tumors on the MR images and results are compared with each other. Application software is designed with a user interface for this purpose. Thus, the ease of decision-making by physicians will be provided. Consequently, the application software will prevent errors and may be used as a secondary means for brain tumor segmentation. It has been shown in detailed test experiments on image dataset that designed application can detect brain tumors successfully."

Two transmitarrays each of 17×17 unit-cell elements are designed to operate at 12 GHz and 17.5 GHz. The peak gains of transmitarrays are 25.31 dBi and 27.1 dBi, respectively. An alternating replacement of the unit-cell elements from the transmitarrays designed at 12 GHz and 17.5 GHz are employed. The hybrid arrangement is used to enhance the gain bandwidth of the transmitarray. A broadband gain response is achieved with 2.4 GHz over the band extended from 12 GHz to 19 GHz."

In consequence, at 51.5 Hz there is still a feed-in of 48% of their available power. Since all power plants (including conventional ones) are required to disconnect at 51.5 Hz, small island grids may collapse due to over frequency without the full potential of power reduction from DGs being realised. This is particularly relevant for power system restoration from small islands within the distribution system. This paper presents a simple island test system, consisting of a 50MW gas turbine, some load and distributed generation. The new contribution of this work is an active power control scheme that provides an improved frequency behaviour in small island grids without any impact on the overall system behaviour in normal operation."

The implementation consists of a mechatronic system that allows a person to play chess against a robot manipulator and on a standard board. The system is based on an industrial type robot, a webcam-based artificial vision subsystem and open software for the game engine. The vision subsystem features a webcam that captures photos from the board. The aim is to detect, by means of classification techniques, whether a square is occupied by a piece, and in such a case whether the piece is black or white. Using matrix models, it is possible to determine the last movement executed by the human opponent. Robotics applied to interactive games is an excellent problem to explore human-robot collaboration as it presents a structure whose complexity can be gradually increased."

How to develop and make use of it has become a great challenge for enterprises.At the same time, the data pile up makes the processing cycle longer, and the complexity of the structure makes the processing difficulty and calculation increase.However, these data are discrete and can not find the correlated relationship between them. Leads to failure to retrieve their hidden information and to search for potential behind faults or threats. It can not provide effective decision support for fault diagnosis and value discovery.Therefore, this paper aims at the data obtained by sensors and monitoring systems in industry. A data association method based on directed graph is proposed, and the calculation of relational strength and temporal proximity is added. Finally, experiments show the validity and accuracy of the proposed method."

Theoretical analysis based on multi-parametric programming theory points out the unique one-to-one mapping between load and LMP vectors. Such one-to-one mapping is depicted by the concept of system pattern region (SPR) and identifying SPRs is the key to understanding the LMP-load coupling. Built upon the characteristics of SPRs, the SPR identification problem is modeled as a classification problem from a market participant's viewpoint, and a Support Vector Machine based data-driven approach is proposed. It is shown that even without the knowledge of system topology and parameters, the SPRs can be estimated by learning from historical load and price data. Visualization and illustration of the proposed datadriven approach are performed on a 3-bus system as well as the IEEE 118-bus system."

It is possible to examine this disease which is manifested in seizures by electroencephalography method. In this study, it was aimed to investigate EEG signals received from epileptic patients who have had seizures continuously during the day by applying wavelet transform. EEG records of 4 epileptic patients having 6 consecutive seizures were taken from the MIT EEG database. The signals were transferred to the timefrequency plane using Wavelet Transform (WT), where the energy values were investigated in delta, teta, alpha and beta sub-frequency bands. Then, the data was analyzed with statistical program and significant differences were observed. In conclusion, the method proposed in this study is thought to contribute to the diagnosis and treatment process by detecting brain oscillations between the seizures of epileptic."

Our goal is to approach price points required for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) while meeting the performance needed for safe self-driving.

Classical SFC relies on dedicated virtual machines for each chained network function. The motivation is to increase the efficiency of the classical SFC approach with respect to latency and throughput. Therefore, compound SFC that are implemented in single virtual machines are proposed. The focus is on the evaluation of the latency of communication between network functions and on the impact of limited computing resources on the maximal executable workload. To evaluate the presented SFC concepts, the performance measurements in a hardware testbed using different network functions have been carried out. A prototype of compound SFC was implemented based on the networking toolkit Snabb. Furthermore, a configurable synthetic network function was implemented and tested. The results show the sensitivity of different parameters with respect to the efficiency of SFC implementation options."

The objective is to establish the obligations and responsibilities of each party; i.e. the TSO and all grid users such as power generating plants, distribution utilities and directly connected bulk industrial customers. This will lead to maintain optimal operation, safety and reliability of the power system. In distribution power grids, a Distribution Code is similarly applied. With the increasing penetration levels of renewable energy sources into electric power grids, utilities have introduced special requirements for the connection of renewable power plants to the grid. Particular attention is given here to large-scale and medium-scale solar power plants. Technical requirements of connecting these renewable sources to the grids (transmission or distribution) should be clearly understandable by all parties to correctly implement the rules and procedures described in the connection codes. The objective is to provide the attendees with basic information on the technical design specifications and criteria, technical terms and equipment parameters appeared in the solar plants grid connection codes. For example, power quality definitions, measures and their cause and impact on the system as referred to in the codes will be discussed and explained. The technical specifications include permitted voltage and frequency variations in addition to power quality measures such as limits of harmonic distortion, phase unbalance, and flickers. Solar generating units operational limits, capability requirements, active power and frequency control, reactive power and AVR, power factor, grid protection, etc. will be explained and discussed."

Metamorphic Testing (MT) is a testing technique that exploits the relationships among the inputs and outputs of multiple executions of the program under test, so- called Metamorphic Relations (MRs). MT has been proven highly effective in testing programs that face the oracle problem, for which the correctness of individual output is difficult to determine. Since the introduction of MT in 1998, the interest in this testing methodology has grown immensely with numerous applications in various domains such as machine learning, bioinformatics, computer graphics, simulation, search engines, decision support, cloud computing, databases, and compilers. The Second International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing (MET) will bring together researchers and practitioners in academia and industry to discuss research results and experiences in MT. The ultimate goal of MET is to provide a platform for the discussion of novel ideas, new perspectives, new applications, and state of research, related to or inspired by MT."

In this work, a driver IC was developed to drive the GaN GIT at high slew rates (~150V/ns) while having built-in active miller clamp and selfgenerated negative voltage rail for crossconduction protection. Experimental results showed that GaN GIT gate driver IC outperformed other methods by allowing faster slew rates and larger immunity to cross conduction."

The experiments were performed using a soft biometric database which contains the human face, body and clothing traits at three different distances. This paper describes the database and analyses the recognition performance. Furthermore, it explores the potency of face, body and clothing for human recognition using sg-CCA fusion compared with other linear dimensionality reduction fusion methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of soft biometric fusion using sg-CCA method for human recognition."

The proposed model also allows using null time constants and thus simplifies the computer implementation of the DAEs.

This paper presents ongoing work on the capability to provide ancillary services in low voltage systems by means of a hybrid energy storage system composed of lead-acid batteries and electric double layer capacitors. The assessed test cases are based on an extended traffic light approach to deal with different grid states that respect a local energy optimization using an automated building energy management system. First results show the hybrid storage system's capabilities of providing ancillary services within the green and yellow traffic light phase."

A broader definition of Semantic Computing includes the computing technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, natural language, software engineering, data and knowledge engineering, computer systems, signal processing, etc.), and their interactions, that may be used to extract or process computational content. This connection between content and the user is made via Semantic Analysis, which analyzes content with the goal of converting it to machine processable descriptions (semantics); Semantic Integration, which integrates content and semantics from multiple sources; Semantic Applications, which utilize content and descriptions to solve problems; and Semantic Interface, which interprets users' intentions expressed in natural language or other communicative forms. The reverse connection converts the intentions of users to create content via analysis and synthesis techniques. This talk introduces Semantic Computing based on its broader and narrower definitions, its relationship with Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Computing and Informatics, and other branches of Computer Science. It also discusses several case studies showing how it can be used to solve more complex problems."

        "abstract": "This paper surveys the control challenges arising from the increasing level of power injected into the network through converter interfaces. As is well-known, converters link renewable based power generation plants as well as voltage source converter based high voltage DC transmission lines (VSC-HVDC) to the main grid. It is shown that current injection control, as it is implemented in almost all wind turbines (WT) controls at the moment, is not suitable in grids dominated by converter in-feeds such as offshore wind farms. A new WT as well as VSC-HVDC control concept, which determines the converter reference voltage directly without the need for an underlying current controller, has been proposed. Additionally, alternative options for frequency support by the HVDC terminals that can be incorporated into the active power control channel have been presented and discussed. Simulation results show that the control approach fulfils all the operational control functions in steady state and in contingency situations supporting fault ride-through and emergency frequency support, without encountering the problems arising from current injection control. Additionally, the author analyzes consequences of the transition from conventional synchronous generator based generation to converter interfaced generation utilized usually for renewable sources. As a conclusion, the author gives their recommendation for the maximum share of converter-interfaced units in future large scale power systems."

In this paper, Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) and Morris-Lecar (ML) membrane models, which have contributed to the literature of theoretical neural science, have been studied. In the first step, these two models have been simulated individually in Simulink environment using Matlab software. In the second step, the ratio of the amount of extracellular ion to the amount of intracellular ion was expressed as Hd/Hi. Based on Na+ and K+ as ions, the effect of Hd/Hi ratio change on AP signal was investigated based on HH and ML as a model. In the HH model, it was searched that the Hd/Hi change due to sodium ions influenced the amplitude of AP and the depolarization phase. The change in Hd/Hi ratio due to potassium ion concentrations was found to affect the threshold and hyper-polarization phase of AP. In the ML membrane model, it was observed that the change in Hd/Hi ratio due to intracellular and extracellular Ca+2 and K+ ion concentrations affected the formation time of AP, firing time, amplitude and formation phases. HH and ML models showed similarity in the same parameters."

We especially provide some numerical data by recalculating for rectangular apertures greater than the half-wavelength with an improved calculation code, since the calculation code developed in the past has some errors for the case of the large apertures. In addition, we visualize the power flow around the aperture by means of the 2D vector plot of the Poynting vector to see the state of the diffraction."

The current deep learning based method is not efficient and requires huge consumption of data and power, which has a long latency running on data servers. With the emergence of autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles and robotics, there is a huge demand to only analyze a necessary sensed data with small latency and low power at edge devices. In this talk, we will discuss efficient machine-learning algorithms such as fast least-squares method, binary and tensory convolutional neural network method, with according prototyping accelerator developed in FPGA and CMOS-ASIC chips, which has potential to outperform traditional GPU devices. The mapping on future RRAM device will be also briefly addressed."

Several mechanisms are designed to better orchestrate traffic between the memory controller and NAND flash to alleviate the speed discrepancy issue. We also propose a proactive GC scheme for the NVDIMM controller and flash controller to intelligently synchronize and transfer data involving in forthcoming GC operations. Our experimental results show that overall the proposed techniques yield 10%∼35% performance improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline schemes."

        "abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The AXIOM platform is built with, in mind, the possibility of executing an application not only on a single board but also, in a distributed fashion, on multiple boards. While this is a classic problem with some solutions in the case of no constraints, it becomes interesting for embedded computing and cyber-physical systems where we aim to accelerate applications while maintaining energy efficiency and also easy programmability. Currently, the AXIOM platform consists of a custom board based on the Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ ZU9EG which incorporates the largest FPGA available on that System-on-Chip at the moment, four 64-bit ARM cores and two 32-bit ARM cores, up to 32GiB of main memory and several 12.5Gbit/s tranceivers. We relyed on this hardware to develop our novel concept, which exploitsdataflow execution in multiple ways for programs that are written in an OpenMP extension, known as OmpSs. A key aspect relates to the adopted memory consistency model, which allows the programmer to focus on aspects other than taking care of the communication among nodes. The lower level of our communication stack relies on a fast interconnect based on inexpensive USB-C type connectors rather than on other proprietary interfaces. The reconfigurable logic provides a complete Network Interface Card (NIC) to allow fast routing of the data and code of the system. We envision many applications for this platform although we are currently focused on developing two basic scenarios based on the Smart-Home and on Smart-Video surveillance. Our initial results confirm good scalability of the platform and a speed-up compared to other programming models such as Cilk and OpenMPI."

This load shifting does not only save costs for the \"owner\" of the load but also helps to balance load and generation system wide by adapting a part of the load to the volatile feed-in. This paper shows an implementation combining the possibilities of day-ahead trading and short-term Redispatch using the continuous intraday market."

Based on a typical model, the inclusion of error integrals in the Lyapunov functions allow the UAV to achieve the desired set points without steady state error despite of changes in plant parameters and sensors noise. The results are compared in simulations to another nonlinear controller to show the robustness of the proposed strategy to disturbance in plant and outputs."

Android malware is one of the major security issues and fast growing threats facing the Internet in the mobile arena, today. So, in this context, DNS (Domain Name System) is widely misused by miscreants in order to provide internet connection within malicious networks and botnets. In our experiments, we use the MalGenome dataset in order to generate network traffic. Besides, most of the malware we examine use DNS in order to obtain the IP address of their command and control servers. Then, the problem of determining the DNS queries done by the malware through devices without modifying the firmware or rooting smartphone, is very important and it poses a big challenge. From traces we generated from apps under test, we can extract malicious URLs invoked by the malware."

Even so, very few users shared information via Internet services. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage users to provide information.

We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method experimentally."

However, to ensure the cluster heads (CHs) have variety of relay candidates without adding extra signaling that yield to additional energy consumption, a relay selection method at the destination is proposed for clustered WSNs. The basic of the novel method is selecting the relay with the optimal location from virtual circular clusters defined at the Sink. As a result, the Sink chooses the relay with minimum two link path length, which minimizes the total energy cost per transmission. Simulation results are presented for different transmission ranges and the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of energy cost per bit, total energy cost and the network lifetime. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the random relay selection method, conventional multi-hop transmission in terms of energy efficiency."

        "abstract": "Summary form only given. Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) embed HW/SW devices that implement controlling strategies of physical processes. Such strategies are usually designed as architecture agnostic mathematical models, that are unaware of constraints imposed by the embedded HW platform. As such, the developed strategy may be unable to control the actual system. This implies the need of cyber-physical virtual-platforms (VPs), where an abstract control algorithm can be refined up to its actual SW implementation. This speech investigates the main methodologies for extending standard embedded VPs to cyber-physical VPs that integrate continuous-time components, like sensors and analog interfaces. We examine the theoretical problem of integrating different models of computations and its practical solution through co-simulation, particularly based on the FMI/FMU standards. However, computational bottlenecks discourage in using co-simulation in real cases, thus more innovative solutions must be used, like the automatic abstraction of IP components. Such techniques are mature and well developed if applied to digital IPs, while they are in their infancy for analog IPs. However, the speech presents innovative and affective approaches in this field. Finally, a cyber-physical VP is also useful for checking and estimating extra-functional properties like power consumption, temperature, ageing and functional safety. This would require the integration of plenty of tools, or the generation of extra-functional models to be integrated in the same cyber-physical VP, which becomes the core tool for CPSs design, validation and optimization."

An analytical model is developed to describe the relationship between the average delivery delay and the distance between neighbor Roadside Units (RSUs) deployed along a road. The effect of message size has been also analysed. The derived model considers a straight highway scenario where RSUs are deployed at the same inter-RSU distance without any direct connection and vehicles are sparsely distributed on the road. We also take into account the dissemination strategy, aiming to minimize the delivery delay. The effectiveness of the derived analytical model is verified through simulation results. The analytical model can also provide important insights for the deployment of RSUs and related reference for the onboard multimedia messages selected to share with others."

This is because such sensors can achieve high accuracy (<; 0.1C error) after a single room-temperature calibration. Although resistor-based temperature sensors can achieve higher resolution and energy-efficiency, they usually require multi-point calibration to reach similar levels of accuracy. In a recent breakthrough, we have discovered that temperature sensors based on silicided poly resistors are an exception to this rule. Two temperature sensor architectures will be presented that use such resistors to achieve good accuracy (<;0.2C) after a one or two-point calibration, as well as state-of-the-art energy-efficiency and resolution."

Producing high quality radar images requires sophisticated algorithms that provide accurate and useful information regarding the scene of interest. Imaging algorithms that provide the highest quality synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery come with a steep computational price: O(N3) operations are required to produce an N pixel × N pixel image; imaging algorithms that require fewer computations introduce errors of varying degree that result from approximations to the signal model. Several sub-optimal SAR imaging algorithms were evaluated to quantify the impact of these approximations for various system parameters and scene sizes. A comparison of image formation times on two low-power graphical processing units (GPUs) provides a realistic comparison of algorithm complexity. Additional algorithms and techniques in the end-to-end image formation process that provide favorable trades between performance and computations are identified, and design challenges specific to a SWaP-limited platform are addressed."

In experiments with healthy participants, EMG signals measured from the arm surface during the arm's stationary position task and the planar motion task, and displacements in the x- and yplane of the arm were recorded. In previous studies, the arm admittance was estimated numerically and experimentally for both tasks. To demonstrate the dynamic arm dynamics, the model parameters obtained with the inverse model will be compared with the parameters calculated experimentally and with matrix frequency response method's."

The new methodology combines accelerated laboratory tests based on the salt deposition method with information obtained from other sources, including combustor rig tests, metallurgical analysis of probes returned after engine service and temperature data acquired throughout the long term operation of sensors installed in aero gas turbines. In addition to life assessment of current thermocouple probes, the work includes assessment of advanced materials and the improved lifing methodology can be valuable in indicating the life of future thermocouple sensors that will work at temperatures higher than today's probes. This paper will outline the basis of the methodology and describe the several challenges to be overcome when using complex engineering data obtained from engines."

Attention is turning once again to the strengths of a single-stage conversion from regulated 48 V down to voltages as low as 1V to supply loads such as CPU cores and DRAM chips. Such conversion can be achieved efficiently and cost-effectively thanks to the latest power MOSFETs and control techniques."

The slogan: “A great solar cell has to be a great LED” has led to all the new solar cell efficiency records. Very efficient light emitting diodes (LED's), surprisingly, do actually become cold as they operate, since LED light carries away entropy. This refrigeration requires superb LED efficiency, which is enabled by 2d photonic crystal patterning, for luminescence extraction."

        "abstract": "With the development of recent technologies on semiconductor industry, SiC-MOSFETs are becoming more and more popular in today's power electronic era. As their operating voltages are getting higher, they have started to replace IGBTs in many applications due to their much less power dissipation and more availability of using in high frequency applications. In this article an induction surface hardening system which operates at around 100 kHz frequency and up to 100 kW output power level has been studied. In order to fulfill these requirements SiC-MOSEFT Power Modules were chosen and two of them per one switch were connected in parallel in order to build-up a full bridge structure for a series resonant inverter. In order to minimize the parasitic inductance effects, a careful study was held on during the parallelization of the SiC-MOSFET modules. Beside this a new and reliable control technique to follow the resonant frequency has also been introduced and realized."
