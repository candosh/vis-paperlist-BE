This unwanted effect gives rise to power fading and ghost targets, which leads to degraded estimation performance and increased false alarms. In this paper, we present mathematical formulations for multipath propagation model and the corrupted echoes, where frequency modulated continuous wave as a commonly adopted transmit waveform in automotive radars is considered. The impact of the multipath propagation on target detection is then analyzed. Additionally, a simple but effective algorithm is proposed to remove the ghost targets. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the satisfactory performance.",

        "abstract": "The simultaneous increase of grid connected converters and decommissioning of conventional power generation integrated via synchronous generators will lead to a change of the transmission system behaviour under faults. This paper reviews the possible behaviour of Modular Multilevel Converters (MMCs) under AC faults considering different grid conditions and control objectives as well as the resulting impact on the line protection functionality. One main result is that typical distance protection relays will mal-operate when installed at radial line ends terminated by MMCs due to the different short circuit powers of the MMC and the grid, the flexible phase angle of the MMCs AC side voltage and the changed current profiles under asymmetrical faults compared to HVAC systems fed by synchronous generators. For cases in which the MMCs is connected at busbars with multiple outgoing lines, the impact of the MMC depends on the short circuit power of the connected nodes. However, even for low short circuit powers of the surrounding grid, both distance and differential protection work reliably as the MMC does not significantly change the characteristic behaviour of the AC transmission grid.",

        "abstract": "The adoption of magnetic couplings enables the transmission of mechanical power relying on the magnetic fields interaction rather than a physical mechanical connection. Hence, the contactless speed/torque transmission leads to improvements in terms of efficiency and reliability, due to the absence of wear out between moving parts. For a specific application, the most appropriate magnetic coupling configuration (i.e. axial or coaxial) is usually identified through a trade-off study. In this paper, a comparative analysis between axial and coaxial magnetic couplings is presented using a two-dimensional subdomain approach. Based on a full-parametric geometry, two 2D analytical tools are developed for each magnetic coupling configuration. These analytical tools are validated against finite element results in order to prove their effectiveness. Finally, the implemented models are used to investigate the impact of parameters, such as permanent magnet span, airgap thickness and number of pole-pairs, on the maximum static torque.",

Mathematical inferences in the proposed system model are obtained by deriving the closed-form equations of the outage probability for the far and near users by considering exponentially distributed channels. The outage probability performances of the relay and cognitive users are analyzed with 106 repeated Monte Carlo simulations, considering the distance between nodes, power allocation coefficient, interference power, and exponential distribution parameters.",

The proposed technique comprises a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the range-Doppler ambiguity function serving as its input. A radar simulator is developed to generate range-Doppler data for a single target with an isotropic antenna. The method is compared with the classical Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) detector, and it is demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms CFAR approximately by a factor of 2 terms of probability of detection (PD) and by a factor of 100 in terms of probability of false alarm (PFA), at a minor cost of computational complexity.",

To avoid the massive damage caused by power blackouts, in this study, several large-scale blackouts that happened around the world recently have been reviewed and analysed. First, the backgrounds, processes and causes of the blackouts are elaborately illustrated. The causes are summarised into some main points, and coping strategy for each point is discussed. Finally, some enlightenments are concluded to cope with the blackouts and guarantee the security of the power system.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new automated system for designing new clothes. Given sample clothes, this system generates matching cloth designs in a few seconds. Optimizing the new cloth design times and decreasing the cost of such designs are some of the main desires of the textile industry, which can be achieved with the help of the system proposed. Our system employs Generative Adversarial Networks of deep learning techniques, which became very popular for many applications. The proposed system has also some valuable properties for the consumers, such as having a completely original design that no other clothing brand offers. We validated the proposed system by performing experiments on volunteers by showing the produced designs and getting their opinions. We are very encouraged by the initial results and we think that the system may be applicable for practical employment.",

        "abstract": "Smart cities are becoming more popular with the increasing demand for applying the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The objective of smart cities is to increase the use of resources efficiently and to preserve data security, integrity, and controlling network infrastructure management. IoT concept can solve many problems related to smart cities, and car parking is one of these problems as with the increase in vehicles' numbers and traffic congestion, the need for a smart parking system has been raised. The parking system will not solve only the driver's problem looking for an available parking space but also will enhance the parking monitoring and management problem. In this research, a detailed and comprehensive literature survey of the previous studies and project implementations will be reviewed to explore the best practices done and to find the gaps in previous studies. Implementation and development of a smart parking system based on IoT technology have been proposed using the simulation method. The system will monitor the parking spaces and enable the drivers to check the available parking slots and reserve it for a specific time. The reservation of the parking slot can save the drivers' time and reduce the consumption of fuel, and this will even lead to the reduction of the emission of Carbon Monoxide (CO) gas to the air by the vehicles.",

        "abstract": "GaN-HEMTs offer new possibilities for the development of advanced power electronics. Due to lower parasitics, GaN devices enable higher switching frequencies and thus higher power densities. However, in comparison to silicon MOSFETs the higher voltage drop during reverse conduction causes more losses during dead time. Therefore, it is essential to adjust the dead time to the actual operation point. This paper proposes a novel method to determine the optimal dead times of the transitions within the half-bridges of an inverter with LC output filter. The dead time is adapted in every switching cycle using variables, which are typically present in the control unit of the inverter. This allows an efficient implementation of the method on microprocessors. The study reveals, based on a 48 V GaN inverter, that the optimal dead time varies in a large range and thus indicates the necessity of an adaptive dead time.",

        "abstract": "At present, the inner rotor or outer rotor BLDC motors are generally used in the electric motorbikes. However, the outer rotor BLDC motors are fast finding applications in wheels of an electric bike for fewer core losses and higher efficiency. But still, the speed of the bikes available in the market is quite low or if people go for some more top speed electric bikes that are very costly. So, in this work, two high speed 36 slots, 24 poles exterior rotor motors are designed for the high-speed, smooth operation of an electric bike. The design of the Hub motors is done based on the hand calculations of the design parameters. Then the RMxprt models are designed using those calculated data, and various iterations are performed for getting the required design. But here, just the final design sheets and plots are shown. Also, the RMxprt models are converted to Maxwell 2D design model for further analysis and accurate and precise design. This paper consists of a comparative study of both the designs based on these calculations, results and graphs. This research work gives a clear concept to the reader for selecting a suitable model according to their applications.",

In this contribution, an extended iron loss model is introduced with a direct identification methodology in the context of temperature estimation. The iron loss model is implemented as part of a fourthorder lumped-parameter thermal network (LPTN), which is parametrised using empirical measurements and global identification. Once parameters are identified using training data, the LPTN model is validated using three unseen profiles cross-validation. Satisfactory estimation is achieved with the average mean squared error of 2.1 K2 and the error bias close to zero.",

        "abstract": "A high gravimetric power density is a key requirement for power-electronic converters in next-generation more electric aircrafts. Analytical modeling of power-electronic converters including the weight of the components allows assessing the power density already in the design phase. However, more design variables exponentially increase computation time. This paper combines analytical modeling with genetic or evolutionary optimization to drastically reduce computation time. This way, even more design variables or a higher level of detail in modeling can be considered. The strategy is applied to a DC/DC converter interfacing the 270V DC bus in an aircraft with a supercapacitor-based active power filter. Both the single-objective genetic optimization of power density and the multi-objective genetic optimization of power density and efficiency are discussed. The results demonstrate the technological benefits of wide-bandgap power semiconductor devices in a more electric aircraft setting.",

        "abstract": "The enormous technological potential accumulated over the past two decades would make possible to change the operating principles of power systems entirely. The consequent technological evolution is not only affecting the structure of the electricity markets, but also the interactions between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs). New practical solutions are needed to improve the coordination between the grid operators at the national, TSOs, and local level, DSOs. In this paper, we define the flexibility range of coordination between TSOs and DSOs. By doing so, we propose an algorithm based on epsilon-constrained methods by means of mathematical programming and power systems principles. We evaluate and compare different classical optimal power flow formulations (AC–OPF, DISTFLOW, DISTFLOW–SOCP, and LINDISTFLOW) for building the flexible TSO-DSO flexible domain. The presented approaches in this paper are analyzed in an IEEE 33-bus test radial distribution system. We show that for this particular problem, the DISTFLOW–SOCP has the worst accuracy, despite the popularity among the academic community of convex relaxation approaches.",

ANSYS is one of such platform which provides the tool for FEM. This paper presents the transient analysis of a Passive Magnetic Fault Current Limiter (PMFCL) using an FEM based approach for both adaptive and non-adaptive meshing. A detailed comparison between the two meshing characteristics has also been analysed. This approach has aided the researchers to easily analyze the working of a passive magnetic fault current limiter without actually implementing it. Results from the adaptive meshing are observed to be more realistic and authentic for the analysis of MFCL over non-adaptive meshing in terms of flux density distribution, leakage flux and performances.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a static generation expansion planning formulation in which operational and investment decisions for a wide range of technologies are co-optimized from a centralized perspective. The location, type and quantity of new generation and storage capacities are provided such that system demand and flexibility requirements are satisfied. Depending on investments in new intermittent renewables (wind, PV), the flexibility requirements are adapted in order to fully capture RES integration costs and ensure normal system operating conditions. To position candidate units, we incorporate DC constraints, nodal demand and production of existing generators as well as imports and exports from other interconnected zones. To show the capabilities of the formulation, high-temporal resolution simulations are conducted on a 162-bus system consisting of the full Swiss transmission grid and aggregated neighboring countries.",

        "abstract": "Since the radar deception jamming interferes with the radar in complicated electromagnetic environments, recognizing the deception jamming is an intractable problem. Various improved jamming strategies have been proposed, while the jamming technology is updated continuously. In this study, a new radar jamming detection method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) is presented. The method firstly uses the nearest-neighbour interpolation (NNI) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to analyse the signal within the time-frequency (TF) range, to obtain the great adaptability on the different condition; then, it uses CNN to detect whether the signal is contaminated by radar jamming and determine the type of jamming. The simulation results show that this method can not only identify transmitting deceptive jamming and velocity deception jamming effectively, but also has good anti-noise performance and robustness. Compared with the recognition method based on time-frequency distribution, the recognition accuracy is 15% higher than the conventional detection model.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Systems can be used for discovery and surveillance. According to the current requirements, accurate ship detection is becoming more and more important. However, the accuracy of traditional ship detection algorithm is not satisfying in complex scene. As a consequence, this paper proposes a novel method for detecting ships within SAR imagery using Gabor feature and Two Parameter Constant False Alarm Rate (2P-CFAR) detection technique. First, feature extraction was performed by using Gabor filter. Then, combined with the extracted orientation feature, the ship recognition of SAR image is obtained by 2P-CFAR detector. Finally, false alarms among the candidate targets were removed by geometric features of the ships. To prove the rationality of this method, experiments were carried with two high-resolution Gaofen-3 satellite SAR images in open sea background. The experimental results show that the presented method has preferable performance in the accuracy of ship identification.",

The Cloud of Things (CoT) has more research openings for the researchers. The Cloud of Things (CoT) features are required for medical industries to save energy and secure the network in the form of Cloud of Medical Things [CoMT]. The CoT integrates the cloud computing’s ‘everything as a service’ concept and IoT’s ‘connect all things’ principle via the internet. The resources management is the essential task in the Cloud of Medical Things [CoMT]. The proposed work mainly covers three factors such as resource Co-allocation, Security and energy efficiency. The aim of the proposed work to Co-allocate the medical devices with more secure and energy efficiently. Here medical devices are considered as a resource in Cloud computing’s resource management techniques. The Cloud of Medical Things [CoMT] connects the medical devices in the cloud. This proposed work is very useful for doctors, lab technicians, patients and researchers. The proposed work has a high Security provided in the form of the cloud security features and IoT features. The Resource co-allocation is a process to allocate the multiple cloud resources to the multiple end devices or medical devices. The proposed work is optimized with the help of a huge number of Quality of Service factors and intelligent algorithms. It will be implemented in the local area network using simulation tools. The result of the proposed work will prove the energy efficiency, high level security and optimized resource Co-allocation in the Cloud network.",

Valasek[1] which can be used in non-volatile memory applications based on two energetically stable distinct electric polarization states. The conventional perovskite based ferroelectric materials suffer from CMOS incompatibility and scalability issues, hence cannot be used in state of the art scaled CMOS technologies. In 2011, ferroelectricity was reported in CMOS compatible scaled doped HfO2 films [2-3], which can solve the integration issues of perovskites based ferroelectrics. Among the HfO2 based ferroelectric materials, the mixed oxide of HfO2 and ZrO2 (Hf0.5Zr0.5O2) exhibits good ferroelectric properties with a wide process window and CMOS back-end compatible thermal budget.",

        "abstract": "The wound field synchronous machine has widespread use both as a motor and a generator, due to its low cost, wide power range and its consolidated history built over decades of operation. A critical aspect of these machines is the method of excitation to the field winding. Typically, the choice is between a static excitation system using slip-rings and a rotating excitation system using a brushless exciter. An alternative is that of removing the classical exciter completely and thus feed the field winding through more advanced `exciterless' solution. The potential to reduce component count and improve power density has resulted in increasing interest in exciterless solutions, over the last couple of decades. This paper thus gives an overview of these methods, assessing and comparing their advantages and disadvantages. A particular focus is on medium power applications, which traditionally have dominated the market of synchronous generators and associated generating sets, and where significant improvements in terms of cost minimisation, power quality, and ease of design are always required.",

However, currently published demonstrations of bearingless motors have been limited to low power levels (≤30 kW). This paper investigates the use of a “no voltage” combined motor winding to overcome performance challenges and enable the development of a medium power, high speed bearingless permanent magnet synchronous motor (BPMSM). An optimization framework is developed and used to explore the design space for several designs with different slot and pole numbers. It is shown that candidate designs achieve > 95% efficiency while requiring <; 5% of the slot space for suspension current.",

        "abstract": "Radar-based human activities recognition is still an open problem and is a key to detect anomalous behaviour for security and health applications. Deep learning networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proposed for such tasks and showed better performance than traditional supervised learning paradigm. However, it is hard to deploy CNN networks to embedded systems due to the limited computational power available. From this point of concern, the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed in this paper for human activities classification. We also propose an innovative data argumentation method to train the neural network using a limited number of data. The experiment shows that our network can achieve a mean accuracy of 94.3% in human activity classification.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes an output regulation method for a piezoelectric transformer (PT)-based power converter that employs an inductorless half-bridge topology for achieving zero-voltage switching (ZVS). The resonant current is first estimated at the input section of the PT. These data are used to indicate the effective signs for zero-voltage switching, applied to a phase-locked loop (PLL) as a reference input, to generate the in-phase gate drive signals with an adequate deadtime. Practical results show successful operation of the PLL controller. This technique is extended to achieve output regulation by a burst-mode hysteresis control. Experimental results demonstrate good agreement with the SPICE-based simulation for output regulation while achieving zero-voltage switching.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method to continuously monitor a power line for fault precursors. Based on a double-ended traveling-wave fault-locating method to locate disturbances, the monitoring logic triggers on current traveling waves as small as a few tens of primary amperes. The logic tabulates locations of the detected internal events and alarms if the event count exceeds a user-defined threshold for any location along the line. We expect the line-monitoring logic to detect organic and chemical contamination of insulators, cracked insulators, encroaching vegetation, and other events with accuracy of about 300 m. This paper describes the logic, shares key implementation details, and reports on selected field events captured from the prototype version of a line protective relay with an embedded line-monitoring logic.",

        "abstract": "During maintenance, understanding the source code is required to determine the part that is relevant to the current task. Usually, software developers and engineers depend on source code comments and documentation to understand the code. Unfortunately, descriptive comments are often outdated or not exist. Summarizing the source code automatically can assist in getting over the unavailability of the manually written comments. This paper proposes a technique to automatically generate natural language summaries for software classes written in object-oriented programming languages. The technique parses the program's source code and identifies the stereotype for the target class and its corresponding methods. A set of predefined heuristics are proposed to select the methods that should be reflected in the generated summaries. A case study has been conducted to validate the proposed technique. Results indicated that the generated summaries provide concise and accurate contextual information about the class and help the developers in understanding their source code.",

The relationship between radar reflectivity factor and ice cloud microphysical parameters is established through forward physical model with different a prior value and crystal habits. The results suggest that: (1) The terahertz and millimeter radar measurements contain enough information to constrain the retrieval of ice cloud properties regardless of a priori value and habits; (2) The retrieval error decreases as the accuracy of a priori increases. The error of spherical particle is basically smaller than that of the mixed particles; (3) Quantitative estimates of the retrieval error are provided. The effective radius is retrieved with errors varying between 0-7% and 0-13% for sphere and mixed habits, respectively. The ice water content is retrieved with errors varying between 2-12% and 2-25% for sphere and mixed habits, respectively.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses load current sharing among parallel-connected DC-DC converters and bus voltage drop issues caused by traditional droop method in low-voltage DC microgrid. Conventionally, I-V droop control is an effective way to parallel converter modules due to its high reliability, extendibility and economy. However, when the effect of mismatching line resistances is considered, the traditional droop control has limitations on the voltage regulation while the load current sharing accuracy is maintained. In this paper, an improved nonlinear droop control method is adopted to realize both accurate load current sharing and local output voltage improvement, which is achieved by adaptively adjusting nonlinear I-V droop curve with the information of DC bus voltage. Meanwhile, a secondary controller of DC bus voltage restoration is introduced to realize voltage drop compensation through the secondary regulation of I-V curve. The simulation model with two source converters and a single Constant Power Load (CPL) was built in Matlab-Simulink, which can be extended to multiple sources and multiple loads connected to the DC bus. Compared with the simulation results of the traditional droop control method and another improved droop control method, the better performance of the adopted control strategy is validated.",

        "abstract": "The energy sector is undergoing a paradigm shift to integrate the increasing volume of embedded renewable energy generation and creating local energy communities or LECs that have been an essential component in increasing the same. Peer to Peer (P2P) energy trading is one of the alternatives to curb the surplus energy flow and would also help in maintaining a dynamic balance between supply and demand in the power grid. In this paper, we propose a P2P energy trading mechanism with distributed solar photovoltaic, community battery storage, and electric vehicle charging points. Game theory is the most widely used approach for P2P energy trading because of its characteristic of solving complicated interactions between provider and receiver. In the present work, we have considered a coalition based cooperative game theory framework whose objective is to maximize the total profit of the coalition. The simulation framework of this mechanism has been tested on a local energy community with 100 households having 50 consumers and 50 prosumers creating a win-win approach for both consumers and prosumers (users able to generate and consume simultaneously). Various trading scenarios have been proposed in this paper depending on geographical location, maximum energy demand, and maximum energy generated. These trading scenarios have been tested on a low voltage model to check their feasibility for a real network. The best operational performance priority at each timeslot with solar PV and community storage has also been analysed.",

        "abstract": "For future more electric aircrafts (MEAs), due to the increasing gap between larger electrical load requests and limited power, a collaborative control strategy for electrical energy has been proposed. An advanced configuration with electrical generator, energy storage subsystem which consist of super-capacitor and battery is studied. Specifically, the control strategy was applied in the simulation and compared with the traditional generator-only control. The simulation results indicate that incorporating energy storage components into the energy system can improve performance of energy offer ability and efficiency. The controller with battery and super-capacitor assembly significantly improved the average electrical power requirement, and the electrical bus voltage was more stable compared to the other system which has no energy storage system. The simulation results indicate that the energy system which is consist of generator and battery and super-capacitor bank and controlled by a collaborative controller is attractive to provide electrical loads for future MEAs quickly, safely, and effectively.",

Centralized DER controls that use Optimal Power Flow (OPF) methods necessitate tractable and scalable computational tools that can handle large DNs with satisfactory performance. In this paper, we compare an iterative OPF method against the standard exact AC OPF calculations in terms of the computational effort and solution quality. Furthermore, we highlight the suitability of the selected formulation to offer voltage support (VS) as an ancillary service to the transmission network. The results are demonstrated using a combination of a medium and low voltage grid, and show that tractable OPF formulations can unlock financial business cases for DNs that can actively participate in VS schemes.",

An analytical expression is derived by using Chernoff approximation for the error probability of the considered system. Then, an asymptotic error expression is also proposed for the considered system. The results obtained from the derived expression are presented in comparison with exact results. Numerical results are shown for different configurations in order to analyze the effects of different values of fading parameter, antenna number and modulation type. In conclusion, it is observed that the approximate results are close to the exact results.",

        "abstract": "Application of the concepts of Complex Network Theory (CNT) in topological modelling of power grid network for analysis and assessment of the events, related to vulnerability of the grid network, following an intentional attack or outage of its element(s) has provided a new dimension for researchers in addressing the issue of cascading collapse in complex power grid network. In this paper typical parameters of topological structure of the complex network has been utilized in order to ascertain the criticality of transmission line subjected to a potential threat of outage. Attacks can also lead cascading failure, casing substantial damage in power transmission sector in turn gives a very bad impact on the economical aspect of the power system. In this analysis, sincere attempts have been made to assess redistribution of load in the adjacent surviving lines following simulated outage of a line having highest magnitude of electrical betweenness. The concept of preferential load distribution among adjacent lines is being considered here and its simulation examines the possibility of cascading failure, subsequent to dynamic redistribution of load following simulated tripping of the preceding line with highest electrical betweenness. The iterative process continues till it converges to a single line, following successive tripping of overloaded transmission lines. Finally outage of this surviving transmission line leads to islanding of the grid network. The developed technique of assessment of cascading failure of a power grid has been investigated and tested on the topological model of IEEE 57 bus test system.",

The idea of the study is to solve the congestion in distribution networks through LFM, non-market-based solutions, or a mix of those alternatives. To do so, the simulation environment enables us to analyse and understand the features of three scenarios associated with congestion management (CM). A deterministic optimisation algorithm in the distribution management system is used to select the best solution candidate for CM.",

We aim to determine the sizes and the locations of capacitors by minimizing the voltage deviations and active power losses. For this aim, we utilized Dragonfly Optimization Model and applied on a modified real distribution system from Almaty, Kazakhstan. To be able to simulate different load conditions, we randomly created varied load conditions taking base case as reference point. Then, the capacities and node locations of capacitors providing smallest voltage deviations and active power losses are selected as solutions. From the simulation results we have observed that Dragonfly Algorithm successfully determines near-optimal locations and sizes of the capacitors.",

        "abstract": "Digital protective relays use finite impulse response filters with sliding data windows for band-pass filtering of voltages and currents and measurement of phasors. Cosine, Fourier, and Walsh data windows are commonly used. Short windows yield faster protection operation but allow larger transient errors jeopardizing protection security and calling for adequate countermeasures. Often, these countermeasures erase some, if not most, benefits of shorter data windows. This paper presents the theory, implementation, laboratory test results, and a field case example of a new filtering method for protective relaying based on window resizing. The method uses a full-cycle sliding data window until a disturbance is detected, at which time the window size is considerably shortened to include only disturbance samples and exclude all pre-disturbance samples. With passing of time, the window size grows to include more disturbance samples as they become available. When the window reaches its nominal full-cycle size, it stops extending and starts sliding again. By purging the pre-disturbance data, the new filter strikes an excellent balance between speed and accuracy. We derive the method for fixed sampling and processing rates and include compensation for frequency deviations in the input signals.",

        "abstract": "Student records play an important role in the academic world. It is therefore essential to handle such records in a manner that is accessible, maintainable and secured. There are a large number of student records that universities need to keep and maintain. Such records may include personal information, academic scores, attendance records, library details, tracking, and access control. With the rapid increase in the number of students year after year, the manual method of maintaining and storing such huge records becomes a vulnerable process to human errors and is insecure. This paper presents a prototype design of low-cost student attendance and tracking system intended for the university campus by adopting a combination of RFID and WSN technologies.",

        "abstract": "Traditional SAR ship detection methods rely on manual designed features and are vulnerable to complex background interference with poor generalization abilities. Those methods based on deep learning can automatically extract features and have super-duper anti-jamming characteristics, which is of great significance for future radar intelligent perception. In this paper, to break the limit of only detecting fixed areas for conventional convolutional neural networks, we propose an improved YOLOv3 SAR ship detection method (YOLOv3-DCN) to adaptive sample the size and shape of ship targets. The enhanced YOLOv3 model is designed based on deformable convolution, the ResNet50 variant feature extractor and the ShuffleNetv2 lightweight method. Compared with the original YOLOv3 model, the mAP increases from 93.21% to 96.94%, and the probability of detection increases from 95.51% to 97.75% on SSDD dataset. In terms of the model size, the lightweight designed model is only one-eighth of the original YOLOv3 model, which can be used widely in real life scenarios.",

With this method, not only can the comprehensive compensation of negative sequence and harmonic be realized, but also the potential safety hazards can be reduced when a locomotive passes through the neutral section. Taking Dd0 transformer as an example of Dd transformer, topologies of the comprehensive compensation schemes are presented in detail, which are divided into compensation mode I and compensation mode II. From the perspective of mathematical analysis, mathematical model of the comprehensive compensation is deduced in detail, and the basic principle of comprehensive compensation is revealed. Based on the mathematical model, the method to determine the compensation scheme is given. Aiming at the comprehensive compensation methods of mode I and mode II, the closed-loop control strategies for compensation mode I and mode II are proposed respectively. Finally, effectiveness and accuracy of the method and control strategies proposed in this paper are verified by the simulation models.",

The research focus has been placed on low-power-loss winding designs, with the use of modern additive manufacturing (AM) techniques in mind. A case study PM machine with concentrated winding topology has been used to demonstrate how the AM enabled winding concepts compare with the more conventional constructions. To make the comparison more relevant, the theoretical body of work has been supported with the existing know-how in electrical machines construction and latest developments in AM. The research findings suggest that the AM winding concepts offer similar power losses with simpler winding fabrication and assembly, subject to further advancement in AM.",

Microgrids will become economically competitive with monopoly grids for a sizable, minority share of total electricity demand. For the Netherlands, in 10% of all neighbourhoods, the application of a microgrid appears economically feasible. A full 58% of all operational hours in neighbourhoods are projected to run self-sufficient with solar-photovoltaic (PV), generator and batteries. Grid connection capacity could be a factor 3 lower (median value) with microgrids containing a mix of solar-PV, wind turbines, batteries and microgenerators.",

The aim of this study is to develop a model that encodes high quality video frames, with true motion dynamics, using only a reference image frame and a skeleton sequence. In this context, Ankara University Turkish Sign Language dataset is used to synthesize new sign videos using a given signer frame as a reference and a skeleton stream. To solve this challenging problem, a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed, where skeletal data is used as a condition. Using the trained model, we are able to generate sign video streams with the given signer, where the motion dynamics are successfully and fluently encoded in the video. Moreover, we evaluated the quality of the generated images using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metric; the FID score is 26.",

Both networks have similar objectives of power losses reduction, preserve network stability even with a high penetration of renewable energy sources, and accommodate new energy sectors such as electric vehicles and energy storage systems. The proposed smart soft open points will enable a flexible inter-exchange of electrical power between the two networks in order to achieve these challenging objectives. Different power management control approaches are provided in this paper according to the traffic conditions on the railway network as well as the power and voltage conditions of the distribution network.",

        "abstract": "Inter-turn faults are most commonly the initial stator winding fault in drive systems with Voltage Source Inverters (VSI). To prevent the propagation of an inter-turn fault, the machine must stay within its thermal requirements at the location of the fault. We present a fault tolerant control scheme which minimizes the propagation of the fault by adapting the operating point of the machine. The heat loss of the inter-turn fault is estimated with a machine learning regression. If the estimated heat is greater than the maximum allowable value, the operating point is adapted until the estimated heat is below this limit. We validated the concept of the control scheme with a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation. For the presented fault scenario, we are able to reduce the heat of the inter-turn fault by 17:5W, which equals a temperature reduction of 140 K. Therefore, we are able to keep the local temperature at the fault under the heat shock temperature of the isolation material.",

In the proposed method, we proposed to use WLBP operator in camera classification application to identify the imaging camera. In our method, the two-dimensional histogram of Weber's features and LBP for camera identification are investigated. For this purpose, experiments were conducted on Dresden database. The proposed method has reached the accuracy of 99.52% on nine digital cameras of different models. In compressed JPEG images with the compression quality factor of 70% the method reached the accuracy of 89.04%. The results indicate that the proposed method has a high degree of accuracy in comparison to other proposed method and exhibits relatively good robustness to compression.",

In this paper a framework for the assessment of the impact of PV and BES systems on voltage profiles and power losses of active distribution networks is proposed. Also, the utilization of the BES is evaluated. The proposed methodology is applied to statistically analyse results obtained from annual timeseries power flow calculations in a real 18-bus low-voltage network considering various operational scenarios; the obtained results are quantified using a set of probabilistic indices. The proposed framework can be a useful tool for system operators to identify operational challenges and ensure the optimal exploitation of network assets.",

This paper investigates the impact of lack of negative-sequence current on impedance-based protection functions. This paper first introduces different methods adopted by major relay vendors to implement the impedance-based protection function. The main focus of the paper is on core impedance measurement or comparison. Therefore, other required functionalities such as fault type identification and directionality to realize this protection function are not discussed. Finally, a comprehensive analysis is presented comparing the impact of IBR fault current characteristics on different implementations of impedance-based protection function as compared to a case where IBR is replaced with an equivalent conventional synchronous machine.",

The method uses the overall design of the backbone network, the FPN feature fusion network, the detection network and the parameter optimization method of the algorithm, and completes the model training on the mask-wearing face training set. In the detection process, the NMS algorithm is used to post-process the prediction results to realize multi-scale perception of the input face and improve the detection accuracy of the face wearing a mask. Experimentally verified, the detection accuracy of this method on the mask-wearing face test set is 0.919, and the average of Easy-0.841, Medium-0.802 and Hard-0.600 is obtained on the three subsets of the WIDER FACE test set. Detection accuracy (mAP). Compared with traditional face detection methods, it has universal advantages, and the video inference speed of the method in this paper reaches 55fps, which can meet the task requirements of real-time face detection with large traffic. In addition, the project team has successfully deployed this method to a fully automatic infrared thermal imaging temperature measurement warning system and put it into use in many places in Beijing, which is of great significance to preventing the spread of the epidemic.",

In contrast to previous publications, the proposed control scheme uses a single current regulator to adjust the q-axis reference voltage, and the d- axis voltage is calculated considering the maximum available voltage from the converter. This allows the full utilization of DC bus voltage and improves the machine efficiency. Furthermore, it is more robust against with regards to machine parameters variation. The analytical design results and the system performance are confirmed by time domain simulation and compared against traditional approach.",

In the system, one base station with multiple antennas communicates with two users with multiple antennas simultantaneously via an energy harvesting relay. Energy harvesting half-duplex amplify-and-forward relay is equipped with multiple receive antennas and single transmit antenna. The outage probabilities related to the users, which is expressed with the help of the end-to-end signal-to-interference plus noise ratio, is investigated through Monte Carlo simulations.",

        "abstract": "When carrying an alternating current, the windings in an electrical machine experience increased losses, due to proximity and skin effects. Quantifying these is necessary to fully understand the impact of motor efficiency, requiring the use of finite element analysis of the winding. For an axial flux machine with a three-dimensional flux path, this usually requires the use of threedimensional finite element analysis (FEA). This work presents a method of using simplified 2D FEA as an alternative to full 3D FEA, a dimensionless analysis argument to account for changing winding conductivities and a frequency-scaling is verified with FEA. The time required to characterise a windings AC losses is reduced by a factor of three orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of technology in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), more and more UAVs are used by power supply companies for power line inspection and maintenance. However, a large quantity of aerial images captured by UAVs are processed manually at present, which relies on prior knowledge of power towers and is not only time-consuming but also inefficient. Worse still, the geographical positions of abnormal power towers are difficult to be obtained so that the maintenance team has no direction to proceed. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method for detecting and locating abnormal power towers from the aerial images captured by UAVs. In this method, an objection detection algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is firstly designed to identify and detect abnormal power towers from aerial images. Secondly, the geographical positions of the detected abnormal power towers are approximated by UAV metadata recorded in aerial images (e.g. pixel size, altitude, pitch angle, roll angle, yaw angle, et al.) and several coordinate transformations. Compared with the classical image processing methods, the present method is automatic and end-to-end, and can be easily applied in the UAV based inspection of power transmission lines.",

The combination of deep learning methods and micro-Doppler spectrograms for radar human activity recognition is becoming more and more popular, but the general network model has many parameters and long training time, making it difficult to train a better network model. Therefore, we have designed an efficient and lightweight network model, which is based on the Mobilenetv2 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The model we proposed can learn the micro-doppler information and can automatically identify tasks of different types of human movements. We use the micro-Doppler spectrogram as the training data of the network model. The model has a small number of parameters. It can train a model very quickly. At the same time, it can trace-off the accuracy and resource requirements. It can be run on the embedded in the system, it can meet the requirements of the human activity recognition system. We have shown very good performance on the experimental data provided by the official, which can not only ensure the accuracy of the model to predict human activities, but also save a lot of training time. At the same time, our experiments found that a single human actvitiy can be quickly and accurately recognized, however, the complex human behavior composed of a series of single actions still needs to continue to work",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for radar-based human activity classification by a neural network taking both micro-Doppler and range signatures of the target as input. Temporally localized features are first extracted from range-time maps and micro-Doppler spectrograms by convolutional neural networks, and then fed into cascaded long-short-term memory for classification. The use of two types of signatures improves classification accuracy without adding much computational cost. The proposed method is evaluated on a relatively large dataset provided by the IET radar challenge “Human Activity Classification with Radar”. By using cross-validation of the training dataset, the proposed neural network achieves 94.8% accuracy taking dual signatures as input, which outperforms the networks using micro-Doppler signature input (93.5%) or range signature input (87.9%) only. On the test dataset, we achieve 100% accuracy via majority voting of multiple instances of the proposed neural network. This result won the first place in the IET radar challenge.",

        "abstract": "Due to the high penetration of non-dispatchable renewable sources, the power system is facing a challenge in operational flexibility. As more and more renewables are replacing conventional generations, integration of energy storage system (ESS) is crucial in providing faster response in balancing and grid services. However, ESS, of today, faces many regulatory and market challenges in order to be deployed in the power system operation. This is also hindering the progress towards the decarbonisation of smart grid network. This paper proposes ESS as a possible “Flexibility Resources” and its potential role in the future smart grid network. This will further support the regulatory authority to define this classification for ESS to overcome the barriers and to procure and valorise the range of services that the ESS can provide. The potential benefits of ESS as Flexibility Resource will facilitate increased participation of storage in different electricity markets and improve the flexibility of smart grid operation with high penetration of renewables. Moreover, it will solve the ownership issues and hence, will be beneficial for all the stakeholders",

        "abstract": "The paper proposes a relatively simple active protection strategy incorporating controllers of the inverter for islanded microgrids dominated by inverter based distributed generators (IBDGs) that can overcome well-understood shortcomings in traditional overcurrent protection schemes applied to weak islanded systems. During a fault, the scheme identifies that a fault has occurred and instructs each IBDG in the islanded microgrid to inject specific harmonic components in conjunction with fault current; relays in the network can subsequently detect the presence and location of the fault based on the injected combination of harmonic components. The coordination of relays is achieved through definite time settings, hence communication between the protective relays is not required to operate the scheme. Furthermore, the scheme categorises the protective relays into two groups to isolate the faulty section effectively to cater for bidirectional fault current flow — this is described fully in the paper. The paper presents the structure of the proposed protection scheme along with injection strategy through the control of IBDGs. Different fault scenarios are presented using a realistic microgrid model so that effectiveness of the proposed scheme can be demonstrated in terms of detecting, identifying the faulted section and isolating the fault to ensure dependability, security and selectivity of the microgrid protection scheme.",

One can optimize multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar waveforms to magnify the difference between deceptive signals and real targets, and in this paper, we examine the performance improvement achieved by designing classification algorithms. The training samples are theoretical target returns and theoretical constant-modulus deceptive signals, both modulated with different Doppler frequencies. Three classifiers, namely the support vector machines (SVM), Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), are considered and the SVM performs the best. With 128-chips phase-coded transmit signals, the waveform optimization algorithm achieves a 6dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement at the 90% classification rate.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for predictive out-of-step (OOS) tripping based on synchrophasors. The OOS condition is predicted based on information of the ongoing power oscillation, where the input signal can be either the phase angle between two nodes in the power grid or the current magnitude of a line. The proposed algorithm first detects power swing by comparing the oscillation magnitude with a set threshold. Once a power swing is detected, a damping coefficient associated to the power oscillation is estimated to assess its stability. The oscillation is predicted unstable and eventually will lead to OOS condition when both the damping coefficient and the input signal are larger than set thresholds. The tuning of these thresholds is relatively simple and straightforward. Results from simulations in the Kundur system and the Nordic 44 model demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to correctly predict coming OOS conditions from the analysis of power swings in the power grid.",

        "abstract": "Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM), as an important deceptive jamming technology against modern radar system, can generate a large number of high-fidelity range false targets before and after real target, thus achieving effective jamming. When multiple jammers apply jamming from different angles, the resulting false targets are azimuthally deceptive, which will further impact subsequent target positioning and precise guidance. In response to the above-mentioned multi-angle dense false target jamming situation, this paper proposes a complete narrowband array radar anti-jamming algorithm, which effectively suppresses the range dimensional jamming by Multiplicative Noncoherent Accumulation (MNCA), and filters the residual angle dimensional jamming by spatial filtering, Wherein, the azimuths of the jammers are obtained by K-means dynamic clustering based on constructed angle data set. Theoretical analysis and simulation show that the method has good jamming suppression ability, and can achieve accurate target ranging and angle measuring.",

In this paper, voltage sag caused by AC port load increase and the influencing factors are studies with a typical power electronic transformer topology as example. A calculation method which can estimate the port voltage sag performance according to the load impedance is proposed. In order to maintain the port voltage stability in the process of load increase, a voltage stability control strategy is proposed based on the double-loop control by increasing the voltage feedforward, which can improve the power supply quality and stability of power electronic transformer. Finally, the MATLAB/Simulink simulation results show that the proposed scheme is accurate and effective.",

        "abstract": "Thermal management is critical to increase the power density and the continuous operating limit of electric motors due to the drive for electrification of the automotive industry. A more advanced active cooling is required and direct oil spray cooling method is an attractive solution because it can give effective convective heat transfer. However, the technical literature providing practical guidelines of how oil spray cooling should be applied to stator with hairpin winding is limited. This paper presents the experimental characterisation of radial oil spray cooling by using different spray nozzles. The test data is analysed to investigate the impact of nozzle velocity on the temperature variation of the end windings.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a small target detection method on sea-surface based on Time Doppler spectrum (TDS) is proposed. Under HH polarization, the TDS of clutter bin and clutter with target bin reflects different frequency shift energy distribution. Each energy distribution patch can be a feature of clutter and clutter with target classification. The convolutional neural network (CNN) has the function of automatically extracting image features to avoid the incomplete description of patches by manual features. As a result, a detector using CNN to extract TDS features is designed. The samples of bin under test (BUT) is the unknow-classification data set of inputting the detector to test its performance. The experimental results obtained from measured data of IPIX radar show that the detector can achieve more than 90% accuracy of small target detection in sea-clutter.",

Our article introduces a Virtual Prototype based approach for the fault analysis and fast simulation of a set of automatically generated and target compiled software programs. The approach scales to different RISC-V ISA standard subset configurations and is based on an instruction and hardware register coverage for automatic fault injections of permanent and transient bitflips. The analysis of each software binary evaluates its opcode type and register access coverage including the addressed memory space. Based on this information dedicated sets of fault injected hardware models, i.e., mutants, are generated. The simulation of all mutants conducted with the different binaries finally identifies the cases with a normal termination though executed on a faulty hardware model. They are identified as a subject for further investigations and improvements by the implementation of additional hardware or software safety countermeasures. Our final evaluation results with automatic C code generation, compilation, analysis, and simulation show that QEMU provides an adequate efficient platform, which also scales to more complex scenarios.",

        "abstract": "With the widespread use of automotive FMCW radars, the problem of mutual interference cannot be ignored. The mutual interference will directly increase the signal noise floor and even result in false targets in a few cases. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an interference mitigation method using an adaptive canceller. Firstly, the particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to minimize the correlation between the waveforms of the victim radar and the interfering radar. Then, the optimal filtering is achieved by the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm based on the reference signal to output interference suppression result. The simulation results show that the proposed method has a good performance on multi-type interference mitigation.",

        "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EV) require the main inverter to convert the DC current of the high voltage traction battery to an AC current suitable for the electrical motor. By switching its semiconductors, the inverter produces a current ripple on its AC and DC side which can propagate through the high voltage DC bus and can accelerate the aging of the traction battery. To improve the understanding of the current ripple and in order to detect critical drive scenarios, this paper presents a validated model which describes the current and voltage ripple of the DC bus depending on rotational speed and torque of the electrical motor. The model of the DC bus is based on the international standard ISO 21498-2, and the state of the art control schemes space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) and maximum torque per amp (MTPA) are used for inverter and machine control in the fundamental speed range and field-weakening region.",

        "abstract": "The maximum voltage overshoot of SiC MOSFETs in power modules limits the switching speed of voltage source inverters in electric vehicles. As the efficiency increases with faster switching transitions, decreased commutation loop inductances allow higher switching speeds at same voltage overshoot level and extend the vehicle’s range. In this research, a SiC power module including an integrated RC-snubber is designed to increase the switching speed at same voltage overshoot. The RC-snubber acts as a damped low inductance commutation loop filtering the switching transients and suppressing the ringing, whereas the low frequency components are filtered by the dc-link capacitor. To meet the target of increased system efficiency, the losses of all inverter components are analyzed for space-vector modulation (SVPWM).",

Therefore, particular attention should be paid to the study of channel equalization. However, traditional channel equalization methods often have the problems of low operating efficiency, large computational burden and poor adaptability, making them less effective. Aiming at this problem, the signal model for multi-channel SAR-GMTI processing is established. Based on this, a novel channel equalization method is proposed in this paper. The experimental results based on the measured data of airborne 7-channel SAR-GMTI system show that the proposed method can effectively eliminate the amplitude and phase error between channels without the need for iterative operation, thus improves the calculation efficiency and GMTI processing effect simultaneously.",

The main objective of this modelling approach is to derive the parametric modelling of real dynamic systems from input output data by using the system identification process. A nonlinear couple multivariable system namely wheeled mobile robot (WMR), a popular laboratory-based test bed pose challenges for several modelling techniques have been considered as a candidate system to estimate the state-space modelling and implement PID and state feedback control law to achieve the stability of the system. The quality of the identified modeling has been verified in the simulation environment.",

Also, the biggest challenge in smart cities is producing the higher capacity renewable energy in a smart way. Nowadays due to usage of electrical vehicle and electrical/electronic products in smart homes the energy demand is high. This article presents the importance of using renewable energy for smart city applications, current trends in installing renewable energy sources and different technologies used to store and distribute renewable electrical energy. Based on this study, it is suggested that more than one energy resources can be combined in a single power station to install high-capacity energy distribution and it can be managed by real-time optimized algorithms. Also noted that CO2 emission is very much reduced by using renewable sources of power in a smart city environment.",

The proposed detector is formed by weighting two detectors, which behave quite differently in the presence of signal mismatch. By adjusting the value of the weight of the detector, the proposed detector can flexibly control the detection performance of mismatched signals. In particular, the proposed detector, with a small weight, is much more selective to mismatched signals. In contrast, the proposed detector, with a large weight, is very robust to mismatched signals. In addition, even in the case of no signal mismatch, the proposed detector with an appropriate weight can achieve higher probability of detection (PD) than the existing detectors. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed detector.",

Although this scheme applies the conventional two-terminal current differential protection principle, it is properly designed to satisfy all the protection reliability requirements, as well as to deal with any particularities encountered in distribution systems. In this regard, coordination of the differential relays with the lateral protection means is ensured. The proposed scheme is applied to replica model of a real medium-voltage distribution network, which is assumed including distributed generators, as well as operating in a ring configuration. Moreover, a theoretical analysis of system operation conditions, which affect the performance of differential protection, is performed. Finally, an adaptive approach for the designed differential protection scheme is investigated, to address the varying post-fault system conditions.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide the ageing population is increasing, and there are new requirements from governments to keep people at home longer. As a consequence assisted living has been an active area of research, and radar has been identified as an emerging technology of choice for indoor activity monitoring. Activity classification has been investigated, but is often limited by the classification accuracy in the most challenging yet realistic cases. This paper aims to evaluate and improve the accuracy in classifying six commonly performed indoor activities from the University of Glasgow open dataset. For activity classification, the selection of features to discriminate between activities is paramount. Activity classification is usually done as one vs all strategy with one classifier and a set of features to distinguish between all the activities. In this paper, we propose to optimise the feature selection and classifier choice per activity using a hierarchical classification structure. This strategy reached 95.4% accuracy for all activities and about 100% for walking, opening the field for personnel recognition.",

However, due to the long round-trip time delay and long integration time, the invalidation of “stop-and-go” hypothesis presents challenge to the radar imaging algorithms. In this paper, firstly, the accurate ephemeris of large-scale lunar surface is created based on the coordinate transformations. Secondly, considering the error of “stop-and-go” hypothesis, the accurate slant range model between the ground-based radar and lunar surface is presented. Finally, the simulation results are presented to verify the correctness of the ephemeris calculation, and demonstrate the slant range difference caused by the “stop-and-go” hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "An impedance-based fault location algorithm for ac transmission lines has been presented in this study. The proposed algorithm uses discrete wavelet transform to extract the features from the voltage and current signals which are measured from one end of the transmission line after the inception of faults. The approximation coefficients of the voltage and current signals are utilized to compute the line impedance. The three-line impedances of three phases are fed to the Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based fault locator to estimate the location of the fault. This paper is only focused to estimate the location of the single line to ground (SLG) fault, as the most commonly occurring fault in the transmission line is SLG fault. The significant feature of this paper is that the performance of the proposed fault locator is immune to fault resistance (FR) and fault inception angle (FIA). Moreover, the proposed approach is free from time synchronization error as the one end data is sufficient to locate the fault.",

In order to study the effect of high temperature on the surface flashover characteristics of insulating blankets, the silicone rubber and resin insulating blankets are selected as research objects. The surface flashover characteristics tests of the insulating blankets under different temperature are carried out. The results show that the peak value of leakage current of silicone rubber and resin insulating blanket increases slightly at 20∼40 ℃, but increases greatly at 40∼80 ℃. The surface flashover voltage of silicone rubber and resin insulation blanket decreases linearly at a temperature of 20 to 80 ℃, when the electrode distance is 4 cm, the reduction rates are 0.0453 and 0.0470 kV/℃, respectively, and the resin insulation blanket has better insulation performance. However, due to the thermal deformation of resin insulation blanket at 60 to 80 ℃, the insulation performance of resin insulation blanket decreases faster at high temperature.",

The open-source flow builds around an industrial strength open-source design database, and incorporates a number of design tools that include physical synthesis synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, global routing and detailed routing. The flow also incorporates analysis and support tools for static timing analysis, parasitic extraction, power integrity analysis, and cloud deployment.

        "abstract": "Azimuth multi-channel (AMC) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective technology to conquer the minimum antenna area constraint and can provide high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) SAR images compared with the conventional strip-map SAR. In order to suppress azimuth ambiguity, AMC SAR will face an important problem: channel imbalances estimation and compensation. At first, this paper theoretically analysis the effects of channel imbalances including amplitude imbalance, phase imbalance and range sampling time imbalance (RSTI) on AMC SAR images, where all these channel imbalances will introduce false targets in azimuth, and RSTI will also make a significant influence on the range of SAR images. And then, in order to validate the above result, some simulations based on the parameters are carried out, and the real image acquired by GF-3 is also described. In addition, the intensity, number, and position of false targets are discussed. Finally, this paper makes some conclusions and points out the problems of these results.",

        "abstract": "For businesses, retaining a customer's interest is more advantageous when compared to winning over a new customer. Identifying churned and churn-risk customers allow businesses to change strategies beforehand fort the best possible outcome. In this study, a new method is suggested to be used in non-contractual businesses. One of the widely used methods for these types of businesses in the literature is modeling customer behavior using Beta-geometric Negative Binomial Distribution (BG/NBD). While this method performs favorably on predicting the total churn rate in a population, it is also known to perform poorly on labeling individual customers. This study aims to improve BG/NBD model by incorporating machine learning into its decision process. In the suggested method, the mathematical definition of BG/NBD model is used for feature extraction and utilized using decision trees. When tested on two data sets with different characteristics, it is observed that the suggested method improves performance by a significant amount.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we demonstrate a state-of-the-art high step-up/down dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter designed with GaN transistors, to achieve a high efficiency and large power-density. A quasi-planar matrix transformer with high step-up/down ratio is demonstrated, whose leakage inductance is responsible for achieving soft-switching and power-transfer, without using any external inductors, resulting in a compact converter. A combination of low-voltage (LV) and high-voltage (HV) GaN transistors operating at both primary and secondary bridges, enabled operation at 300 kHz to significantly reduce the size of the ferrite core in the transformer. By applying the simplest modulation (single phase shift) suitable for very high switching frequencies, the converter could transfer up to 500 W (reaching up to 10 kW/l or 164 W/inch(exp 3) in power-density) with a peak efficiency of 97.4% at a 12-time step-up. After discussing guidelines of passive and active component design and selection, we benchmark DC-DC converters and compare the performance of our design to other state-of-the-art high-frequency converters. Furthermore, we discuss how such DC/DC converters could serve as chargers in electric vehicles (EVs) to provide efficient power transfer in a compact size with galvanic isolation, which is required for such applications. The converter can be regarded as a flexible DC transformer in future DC distribution systems and microgrids for efficient, compact and regulated power transfer.",

        "abstract": "With the increased penetration of renewable generation such as photovoltaics and wind turbines, the equivalent inertia and equivalent damping of the power system gradually decrease, which will result in stability problems becoming more and more serious. Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) technologies can enable power electronic interface inverters to simulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SG), thereby controlling grid-connected inverters as synchronous inverters and greatly improving the grid's ability to accept distributed power supplies. Additionally, it also effectively reduces the impact of the traditional grid-connected inverter on the stable operation of the power system during the grid-connected and off-grid process, which shows natural friendliness to the power grid. Therefore, VSG technologies have great research value and wide application prospects. This paper first expounds the basic idea of VSG, then further analyses and studies it from mathematical modelling, control strategies, stability analysis and application prospects, and finally puts forward several possible future research directions based on the project of my task group.",

With the development of radar technology, waveform designed by a single-criterion is difficult to meet the radar's multi-tasking and multi-working mode. This paper presents a waveform design method based on deep learning in the presence of clutter. We design a deep learning model to learn the manner of the Mutual Information (MI) criterion and the Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) criterion for designing waveforms, which enables the model has the characteristics of MI and SINR criteria simultaneously and realizes a smooth trade-off between the two criteria. The results show that the waveform design based on deep learning method is satisfactory and effective.",

Firstly, the influence of wind power access on the voltage quality of distribution network is analyzed, and the control idea of optimal operation is determined. Secondly, aiming at the problem of reactive power coordination optimization after wind power is connected to distribution network, a reactive power optimization model considering economy and power quality is established. The model is solved by introducing uniformly distributed initial harmony database and improved harmony search algorithm of variable dimension and voice database, and the results are compared with those of particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, the control strategy of reactive power optimization in distribution network is obtained. The test results show that the proposed optimization model and algorithm can achieve maximum wind energy absorption on the basis of satisfying the relevant constraints, especially ensuring the voltage quality of distribution network nodes.",

        "abstract": "The classification of intercepted radar signals has gained considerable attention in the field of electronic reconnaissance. Currently, the multi-function radar (MFR) is capable of transmitting complex and agile signals with different working modes, and the classification of radar waveforms using the traditional methods does not provide satisfactory results. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new intelligent algorithm to recognize the working mode of MFR. In particular, this paper designs a novel feature extraction method to obtain the sequential relationship of the input signals. At the same time, a hierarchy of signal features is established to represent the signals layer by layer, and then the working mode of the emitter is determined effectively by unsupervised clustering method. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method is experimentally verified, through simulating the real complex electromagnetic environment and generating the signal samples of MFR.",

        "abstract": "The main problem for any transient earth-fault protection is to extract the useful signal components from the measured residual current Io. Many used solutions are based on either complete fundamental frequency and/or complete higher harmonic phasors. However, for the fundamental frequency current phasor of the Io current, only the Io1∗cos(φ1) component has useful physical meaning during the EF transient, while the Io1∗sin(φ1) component is just a disturbing part which can only cause the wrong operation of the protection. At the same time, for all higher harmonics phasors of the Io current the situation is exactly the opposite. The Ioh∗sin(φh) is the useful component with a clear physical meaning while the Ioh∗cos(φh) component is a disturbing part which can only upset the earth-fault measurement. In the proposed solution, only the two useful components are used. They are first integrated over short period of time deriving values proportional to the energy content of the two original signals. Only the positive or negative sign of these integrated values is then used in the design to determine the direction of the earth fault. Before being used for directionality check, the integrated value must also exceed the pre-set minimum threshold level, for security reasons.",

An effective as well as economic way to improve system's reliability is distribution network reconfiguration (DNR). In this paper, first, the nonlinear constraints of the original DNR problem are transformed into second-order cone programming constraints providing a convex formulation. Then, a new path-based methodology including mixed integer linear constraints for optimal reliability-oriented DNR is proposed. Therefore, this paper proposes a convex model for optimal DNR with the objective of 1) reliability indices improvement, and 2) energy loss minimisation. The proposed method is applied to a 135-bus power distribution system with five DG units and different scenarios for the objective function's terms are investigated. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed optimisation model.",

In such aircraft, electromechanical actuators (EMA) are being progressively introduced to substitute hydraulic actuators. In EMA systems, multiphase technologies are gaining popularity due to their high power density and fault tolerance; however, complexity is increased. To accelerate the early development stages of such systems, real-time simulation can be considered. This work presents a real-time simulation platform for a landing gear EMA implemented in an RT-Lab digital simulator, where the multiphase power system is simulated in an FPGA.",

        "abstract": "As a new type of transmission, GIL is widely used all over the world. Compared with gas insulated switchgear (GIS), GIL has a greater possibility of internal insulating gas leakage. In UHV GIL, the total amount of SF6 gas is up to about 750 tons. A small amount of gas leakage may cause power system fault, environmental pollution and even personal injury and death, It is necessary to improve the leakage rate index greatly and strictly control the gas leakage. In view of the requirement for extremely low gas leakage rate of UHV GIL, this paper proposes the method and key parameters of helium mass spectrometry vacuum leak detection. A helium mass spectrometry leak detection system with a length of 20 meters is applicated for the first time in the world. Through the research and comparison of the leak detection methods, two common air-tightness detection methods (local binding cover method and buckle cover method) were analyzed by experiment. Considering the detection efficiency and detection accuracy, a high-precision, quantifiable helium leak detection method combined with the SF6 partial buckle cover and fixed volume buckle cover is proposed in the type test and the factory test. The results show that SF6 annual leakage rate in GIL compartment is decreased from 0.5% to 0.01% and the minimum leak detection rate of the system reaches 1×10-8Pa m3/s. This study bcan provide a basis for further improving the gas leak detection efficiency in the future.",

        "abstract": "Designing small and high-power density machines requires a good knowledge of the thermal behaviour in an early stage of the design process. As the end windings have a comparable long thermal path to the cooling medium, it is most likely the hottest component in an electrical machine. Therefore, it is essential to have a thermal model of the end windings in order to estimate the temperature distribution in it. In this paper, we present an analytical lumped-circuit approach for the thermal modeling of the end windings. We have applied the extended layer approach, which homogenises the stator slot considering four directions in predefined layers, and extended it in axial direction. With the extension in axial direction, we can simulate the heat flow and can predict a temperature distribution along the wires. We have implemented the approach for a tooth-coil winding, simulated and validated it with a Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The innermost layers in the end windings show the hottest temperature due to the longest thermal path to the cooling medium. For a defined load step, which equals the rated operating point in the observed driving cycle, the maximum temperatures differ by a maximum of 12:1K compared to the FEA results. The average and minimum temperatures differ by a maximum of 4:4K and 8:8K. In thermal steady-state, the temperatures differ by 9:5K, 0:8K and 8:8K for the maximum, average and minimum temperatures. Along the windings in axial direction the temperature difference for the average temperatures is given by 4:6K and 2:5K for the analytical approach. The validation with FEA results shows a good accordance to the analytical approach, while the simulation time is about 400 times faster.",

        "abstract": "Local voltage control schemes of distributed generation (DG) such as reactive power as a function of voltage, characterised as Q(U) control have the advantage of providing faster control response to the variability nature of DGs and loads. The challenge however with this control is the tuning of the control parameters. Subsequently, this paper proposes a centralised control scheme based on system optimization to tune Q(U) control parameters. The optimization determines the optimal settings of the on-load tap changer (OLTC) and voltage regulator (VR), the voltage sensitivity with respect to reactive power and the optimal voltage values for the buses where DGs are integrated on an hourly basis. These sensitivity values are then used to tune and adjust the Q(U) control to regulate the voltage within a 15 minute interval. Thus, a coordinative voltage control scheme is achieved based on different timescales. This scheme when implemented on the United Kingdom generic 16 bus medium voltage distribution grid improved the voltage stability index as compared to the scenario where the DG operated with fixed Q(U) control parameters. Also, the scheme improved the voltage profile at the point of common coupling where the DGs were connected.",

If the intermittent fault in aircraft fuel system can not be diagnosed accurately and promptly, it will cause serious accidents. A method of intermittent fault diagnosis based on support vector machine (SVM) is presented. A simulation platform based on Flowmaster is built to simulate the intermittent fault in the aircraft fuel system. The fault signal features in the fault system are extracted according to the time series. These fault features are trained as the training data of SVM.The training results show that this method can accurately diagnose and locate intermittent fault in aircraft fuel system.",

        "abstract": "High-speed manevuering target detection has been a challenging problem in recent years. The range migration (RM) and Doppler frequency migration (DFM) induced by the complex motions of a maneuvering target should be solved firstly in order to ensure the adequate output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for effectively target detection. In addition, the pulse repetition frequency is limited to satisfy the large range observation area requirement, which leads to the troublesome Doppler ambiguity and Doppler aliasing phenomenon and further degrade the target detection performance. In this paper, some characteristics for a maneuvering target with velocity ambiguity and Doppler aliasing target are presented, and then, a modify Keystone transform matched filtering (MKTMF) method is proposed to realize the long-time coherent accumulation for this kind of moving targets. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Cascading events in power systems are typically analysed using static power flow models. These static models represent cascading events as a series of discrete transitions, and ignore the temporal nature of the cascading outages. Therefore, they cannot capture the dynamic characteristics over different timescales. This work investigates and highlights the differences between a novel dynamic model and a conventional static model for cascading failure studies. N-2 contingency analysis is performed and the unserved demand and the number of line outages are used as metrics for quantifying the cascading effect. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to evaluate the impact of key parameters of the static cascading model on the potential risk of cascading failures. The application of the proposed methodology on the IEEE 39-bus systems shows that the two models can produce consistent data distribution and cascade patterns, but differences do exist. The results show the importance of carefully determining the generation and load dispatch capabilities when using static models.",

        "abstract": "Doppler radars have been extensively utilized for human activity recognition, which is capable of providing contactless sensing in all weather regardless of illumination conditions. We proposed a modified dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to discriminate six activities, those are walking, sitting down, standing up, picking up an object, drinking water, and falling, by combining both information of spectrogram inner structure and intensity distribution. Standard DTW for activity recognition usually employs spectrogram envelope as the input sequence and does not specifically consider the multi-dimensional characteristics of human activities. The Micro-Doppler spectrogram of human activities obtained by time-frequency analysis contains rich information such as motion intensity, direction and range. We first scale the intensity of spectrogram into 256 levels and then segment the scaled spectrogram into sequential vectors along time as the input of DTW distance matrix. In this way, both inner structure and intensity distribution of the spectrogram can be extracted and fully exploited. A K-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier is employed based on the DTW distance for further activity recognition. The experimental results using the given test dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method, exhibiting a recognition accuracy of 100% using full training dataset, and 97% for the dataset with test data discarded.",

This paper applies a general common-mode modeling approach to rigorously identify emissions sources and the effects of typical filter inductor design asymmetry in buck and boost converters. Analysis of the resulting common-mode equivalent models corroborates the established benefit of balancing the filter inductors for the boost converter. In contrast, it is shown why the same balanced design greatly increases emissions in the buck converter using straightforward circuit analysis techniques. Finally, a set of empirical tests are conducted utilizing a prototype 1-kW GaN-based converter system to validate the model predictions and analysis.",

        "abstract": "Hardware implementation of controllers for modular multilevel converter voltage source converters is a non-trivial task, which requires a thorough evaluation of the real-world performance of control hardware. This paper presents a new processor-in-the-loop system developed at The University of Manchester which enables real-time evaluation of power converter control algorithms implemented on a target hardware platform from within a PSCAD/EMTDC simulation. The developed system has been used to measure the execution times of sorting algorithms implemented within the capacitor balancing control loop of an MMC. The system is a low-cost alternative to commercial real-time hardware-in-the-loop systems, and can be used to bridge the gap between offline simulation and final controller implementation in hardware. The developed system can be extended to support any control algorithm of interest, implemented on a wide range of target hardware platforms which may include: embedded microcontrollers, digital signal processors, and field-programmable gate arrays. Applications include control systems for power electronics connected to power systems including HVDC, renewable energy and smart grids.",

        "abstract": "SAR image ship detection has important applications in military and civil fields. With the wide application of deep learning in the field of computer vision, more and more SAR ship detection algorithms have applied deep learning. Neural network based on deep learning can automatically extract features instead of hand-crafted features, and has achieved great success. But the design of deep neural networks is time-consuming and complex, which need a lot of professional knowledge and experience. Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great potential in automated design networks. NAS can find the most suitable architecture on the specified dataset within a given search space. In object detection, the scale of the object varies, which is usually solved by designing feature fusion network. So in this work, we proposed to use differentiable architecture search to search the feature fusion module for SAR ship detection. The experiments on SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) showed that the discovered architecture can replace the corresponding part of the detection network with 1% performance improvement.",

Current approaches rely on large power stations but as the industry moves to cleaner and more decentralised energy, new options must be developed. The expansion of DER and network flexibility presents an opportunity to develop a radically different approach to system restoration. Greater diversity in black start provision will improve resilience and increase competition leading to reductions in both cost and carbon emissions. However, there are significant technical, organisational and commercial challenges to address. The first stage of the project assessed the viability and requirements of delivering black start using DER.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a robust and easy-to-implement approach to measure the junction temperature of SiC power devices using quasi-threshold voltage as temperature sensitive electrical parameter with adjustable temperature sensitivity. The voltage drop across the parasitic inductance between Kelvin and power source is used to trigger the data acquisition circuit. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the concept of variable temperature sensitivity where the robustness decreases with the increase in the sensitivity. This concept proposes a trade-off between temperature sensitivity and robustness. A D flip-flop is used to make the acquisition circuit more robust to prevent false triggering while keeping fast switching speed and low noise susceptibility. Basic simulations, static and dynamic measurements are performed successfully on a commercially available 1.2 kV/120 A power module in a buck converter topology. The effect of DC-link voltage and load current invariance is also verified in this paper.",

The influence of parallel connection on current interruption is investigated by circuit simulation. It is turned out that the parallel connection does not affect adversely the current interruption in the case of 3-parallel connection. In addition, it is demonstrated that threshold voltage (VTH) rather than gate inductance is important factor of the device for suppression of current deviation. We fabricate 3-parallel connected GaN bidirectional switch with the same VTH. The Ron of 9.3 mOmega and the maximum current of 390 A are attained in this device. The fabricated SSCB interrupts the current of 306 A within 1.2 mus successfully by appropriate gate driving.",

In practical application, the output voltage as well as the output power will fluctuate irregularly when the spatial positions of loads changes randomly. To deal with this issue, a control strategy employing pulse density modulation (PDM) under different switching frequencies is proposed in the sending or receiving side for multi-load MCR WPT system to realize constant output voltage at loads under varying spatial misalignments. In this paper, a double-frequency double-load MCR WPT system is investigated as an example, and the equivalent circuit model is built and analyzed. The detailed implementation of PDM control is presented, and the experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical analysis and proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of novel encapsulation materials is one opportunity to enhance the thermal, mechanical and thermomechanical performance of power electronic devices and modules. Because of the increased heat conductivity and low thermal expansion properties of cement-based materials they are potential candidates for further enhancement of reliability properties or miniaturization approaches. For a defined material design of these encapsulation materials multiple variations of the cement compositions, as well as different filler materials or filler contents are available, resulting in a wide range of available material properties after the hydration process. In order to allow a target-oriented material design, a microstructural and reliability driven simulation approach is presented. Therefore, the influence of the microstructure composition related to major engineering properties is studied by numerical approaches. In addition, the influence of the cement encapsulation on typical failure modes of an “Econo3” power module under power cycling conditions was analyzed and compared to common silicone gel encapsulation. The analyzed failure modes include bond wire fatigue, solder fatigue and fracture modes related to chip- or substrate failure. In order to verify the outcomes of the finite element modelling, also the local load distribution using these new encapsulation materials was compared exemplarily with finding from destructive failure analysis like cross sections of the solder interface and bond wires.",

        "abstract": "This Paper investigates the transient overvoltage (TOV) issues due to the commutation failure at inverter side of AC system. It’s a case study of 1st HVDC project that is in construction phase in Pakistan. The Project is Parallel ±660kV LCC HVDC transmission Links to transmit Bulk amount of Power from south to North of the country. As the rectifier converter station of two transmission line are very close to each other, commutation failure on inverter side AC system of any transmission line causes TOV issues on rectifier side AC system of both Transmission lines. PSCAD based model is designed to study the steady states and transient states (TOV and Commutation Failure) of the system. The main focus of the study is to understand when a commutation failure is occurred at inverter side AC system then how it will affect the TOV at both rectifier side AC systems and how the variation of SCR at rectifiers of both transmission lines reduce the TOV issues. By the simulation based study of PSCAD model it’s found that commutation failure at inverter side of AC system of transmission line 1 or transmission line 2 has a prominent effect on the Transient over Voltage issues of rectifier side AC system of both lines. Similarly it is observed that by keeping the SCR at rectifier side AC system of one transmission line constant and increasing the SCR at rectifier side of ac system of other transmission lines much reduces the transient over voltage issues.",

        "abstract": "The fleet of smart distributed energy resource (DER) inverters is expected to grow rapidly as a result of growing DER penetration levels and requirements in interconnection standards/rules such as IEEE Std 1547-2018. Smart inverters have the potential to help to maintain and/or enhance grid safety, reliability and customer affordability. Advanced modelling and analytical capabilities are required from distribution planning tools to understand the full potential of smart inverters. This study presents enhanced smart inverter modelling and simulation features included in a recent release of the open-source distribution system modelling and simulation software suite OpenDSS. The enhanced features include detailed modelling of the inverter capability curve along with significant improvements to the simulation speed and convergence. The enhanced features make it more practical to perform long quasi-static time-series load flow simulations with thousands of time steps on large-scale utility feeder models with up to thousands of autonomously controlled smart inverters. Some of the enhanced speed, convergence and other features are demonstrated on a large-scale real U.S. utility feeder model with >1100 solar photovoltaic systems.",

Both GaN E-HEMT and SiC MOSFET can achieve high power density by using high switching frequency. This paper provides a comparison within WBG devices for a high frequency Power Supply Unit (PSU). The PSU consists of a CCM Bridgeless Totem Pole Power Factor Correction (BTP-PFC) AC/DC stage in conjunction with an LLC resonant DC/DC stage.

Considering the characteristics of small scale and few features of radar targets, the original YOLOv3 backbone network is pruned and nonlinear features are added, and the Darknet13 network structure is proposed. The multiple outputs of the Darknet13 network are fused in two scale, deep fusion is used to detect large-scale targets, and shallow fusion is used to detect small-scale targets. In order to solve the problem of imbalance between positive and negative samples of radar data, the focus loss function is used to strengthen the attention to the hard to distinguish samples. Meanwhile, warm up technology is used to optimize the learning rate adjustment strategy to improve the target detection performance and network training speed. The experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOv3 algorithm, the proposed method can improve the average detection rate by 8.4% and reduce the average false alarm rate by 79.8% when the signal-to-noise ratio is 10 dB.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has become a very commonly used term in our daily life in a very broad manner, yet its definition remains to be specific to the connection of unordinary devices such as fridges and drones etc. to the internet creating an ecosystem with various applications (Meola, 2018), interconnecting them and providing multi-functional and innovative solutions. The IoT applications have been in constant development in recent years, making it very difficult to find an industry that had zero influences from IoT solutions. A few examples include: Smart Homes, which can be derived from its name as many different devices that are commonly found in your home such as, fridge and lights, are all connected to the internet and can be easily accessed through your phone. Furthermore, although smart parking systems currently exist, however most of them have minimal features, such as if the park is occupied or free. As such, a smarter parking system could be developed by developing an IoT system (Al-Hamami, 2017). The proposed Smart Parking System in this research is an addition on existing smart parking systems by introducing actual smart features, such as preventing drivers to hit-and-run, occupying multiple parking spaces and parking in spaces for people with special needs. A prototype has been developed using Raspberry Pi 3, Sensors and Python language, to prove the concept successfully. The prototype is now able to react and interact differently in each different situation and creating a new open environment for parking system where many custom enhancements and developments can be integrated easily. A survey was also conducted to identify the possible problems of a typical parking lots especially in major shopping malls. This research will ultimately ease the parking not only for users but also for the shop owners by making parking management easier to manage and control.",

Under the condition of limited volume, the 5-phase fault-tolerant PMSM servo system driven by H-bridge has the ability of fault isolation and fault tolerance. In this paper, the fault-tolerant control algorithm based on decoupled space voltage vector is proposed to reduce the torque fluctuation in single-phase open fault condition. The proposed algorithm can reduce the output torque-ripple from 40% to 10% when the fault of one phase winding open occurs.",

        "abstract": "Within the long-time coherent integration (CI) in radar detection, high-speed targets generally suffer from the range walk (RW) effect, which leads to the typical coherent detection failure. To acquire robust coherent detection, this paper proposes Radon inverse Fourier transform (RIFT). In this paper, we focus on the fact in fast frequency-slow frequency domain that the echo of the target is characterized as a unique straight line whose location simply corresponds to the velocity. Benefiting from this fact, the velocity can be estimated through velocity searching via RIFT, in which the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) is exploited along the velocity-related straight line. Then, we can conduct the CI employing RIFT with the estimated velocity. In comparison with keystone transform (KT) and Radon-Fourier transform (RFT), the advantages of RIFT are as follows: low computational complexity, no interpolation loss as well as the blind speed sidelobe (BSSL) simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed RIFT. Specifically, the proposed algorithm yields 2dB better antinoise performance than scaled inverse Fourier transform (SCIFT) and frequency-domain deramp-keystone transform (FDDKT) in the high-speed target detections.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology is most commonly used in the frequency span of sub-30 GHz which provides the spatial resolution in the range of sub-cm. This technology is being extended to higher frequencies such as millimeter wave and THz region to achieve higher resolution in the range of sub-mm. This expands the SAR applications for material characterization, classification and sub-mm localization. However, the region is suitable for short propagation distance such as an indoor environment. Therefore, to investigate the achieved resolution and quality of the SAR images at THz, an indoor SAR testbed based on vector network analyzer has been setup for the measurements. This paper explains the indoor SAR geometry and describes the associated testbed along with the system parameters. The measurements are performed at a centre frequency of 275 GHz with a bandwidth of 110 GHz. The measurement results are analyzed for the theoretical resolution with the Backprojection Algorithm and the findings are presented in this paper. The sub-mm spatial resolution imaging of two small size metallic objects are performed.",

Accurately and comprehensive analysis of the impact of large-scale EVcharging on the power grid will provide theoretical preparation for the development and application of EV, and provide basic guarantee for a large number of EV charging stations to access the power grid.Therefore, this report studies the typical simulation system, and studies the impact of large-scale EV charging load on the power grid from the aspects of safe operation, planning and constructionas well as economy of the power grid. The simulation verifies the impact of large-scale charging load on distribution network voltage and load rate. And analyzes the influence of different access locations and access capacities of large-scale EV charging on the power grid, puts forward the layout planning method of charging stations, and explores the typical structure and operation mode of distribution network suitable for EV charging load access. It provides theoretical preparation for the large-scale EV to be connected to the power grid and has important guiding significance for promoting the development of the power grid technology suitable for the large-scale application of EV.",

The proposed topology inherently ensure zero voltage switching operation enabling high switching frequency keeping high efficiency. The novel non-isolated driver IC, with truly differential input, works also as floating high side driver, which lead to a driver circuit footprint reduction by 75% compared to an equivalent dual isolated driver IC. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the prototype achieves 3060 W/in(exp 3) power density and a peak efficiency of 97.13% at 48-V input voltage including auxiliary losses.",

The options for assembling the array in an outer rotor design are discussed from a simulation and practical perspective. A pole first based approach is shown to give a more reliable magnet location. The final machine is experimentally compared to results from a surface mount variant with the same magnet mass. A battery emulator and dynamometer is used to mimic the performance in a vehicle. The Halbach version is shown to require between 6% and 15% less current to deliver the same torque across the operational speed range and 20.6% more power.",

One of these applications is monitoring then controlling the physical processes. We all know that fuel is a vital resource for life that make consumption and management is a key issue nowadays. Information technology systems (ITS) for fuel control are currently facing interoperability problems in pump stations due to the carelessness or neglecting of some drivers which cause fuel spill squinted on the ground. This paper proposes a new idea with new processes for fuel-saving, by installing a WSN operated with the Internet of Things (IoT) scheme. The WSN, mounted in the tank of the vehicle, will sense the level of fuel and filling percentage and help the pumping machine to fill the tank with the capacity required not to exceed the maximum capacity of the tank. Based on this standard, this paper proposes a Smart Filling Pump Station (SFPS) model combining IoT technologies with processes decision support systems.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, because of the widespread of the online learning platform, automatic engagement detection arise a lot of researchers' interest. With the help of engagement detector, teachers or platforms can arrange the learning materials more personally for each learner. Currently, most work only focus on improving the accuracy of the engagement detector. While this work think only detect the engagement level is not enough, we also need to consider how to actual use it in onlinelearning platform. To this end, we first introduce the balanced random forest model to solve the classification task, then a method based on forest model is designed to find its local explanation (ie. why the student is disengaged). We think the local explanation can provide a reference for lecturers or platforms to improve the learners' learning experience. The system is tested through DAiSEE dataset. The final F1-score reaches to 0.809 for detector. We then compare our local explanation with LIME[1], the top 5 result are almost the same. However, our method is fast enough to be used in an realtime system. The result shows that our method does work.",

The moment feature is selected as the contour feature, and the HOG feature is selected as the texture feature. Considering that the single feature recognition method has limitations and the accuracy of multiple classifications is poor, the feature fusion method is used for optimization. This paper proposes a new feature-level fusion idea, try to use Fisher scoring method to select features, at the same time use FS as the fusion weight, and reduce the dimensionality of the moment features by PCA according to the weight value to obtain the fusion feature matrix. The recognition performance is better than ordinary weighted fusion algorithm. At the same time, the idea of heterogeneous feature fusion is given, that is, decision-level fusion.",

An example of such a \"new\" method consists in computing conservative approximations of well-chosen \"stability regions\". In this talk I will briefly present some stability regions that seem relevant, as well as a method to approximate them, either from outside or from inside, using Lasserre's Moment-SOS hierarchy. Then, since such a method is very sensitive to the state space dimension, I will give some insights on how to lighten the computational burden of the hierarchy while maintaining numerically certified approximations.",

The high-frequency resonant converter has the advantages of constant charging current and strong anti-load short-circuit capability when used for capacitor charging, which is very suitable for charging high-voltage pulse capacitors. In this paper, through the mathematical analysis of the steady-state working process of a series resonant charging power supply working in discontinuous current mode, the change law and peak characteristics of resonance current, resonance capacitor voltage, load capacitor charging voltage and charging current, and average charging current are obtained. It is proved that the series resonant power supply has inherent constant current charging characteristics, and the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by simulation calculation. Finally, a series resonant power supply with a resonant capacitor of 32μF, a resonant inductor of 208μH, a resonant frequency of 2kHz, a charging voltage of 10kv, and a charging time of 0.2s is designed. The measured results of the power supply are basically consistent with the calculated results.",

        "abstract": "The gate unit is the main part of the high-power semiconductor device IGCT, and it controls the turning-on and turning-off of GCT. For the gate unit, the cathode current commutation relies on the energy stored in the turning-off capacitor stack. In order to achieve the reliable turning-off and increase the turning-off capability, some methods can be done, such as: reducing the parasitic parameter of the turning-off circuit, selecting the electronic components with lower parasitic parameters, and increasing the gate cathode reverse voltage. But these methods are always limited, and the lifetime issue of electrolytic capacitors of turning-off circuit is a key factor which affects the life of IGCT. So based on the principle of IGCT, this paper proposes a novel turning-off circuit to ensure that the capacitance of the turning-off capacitor is extremely little under the same turning-off current, and it can fully guarantee the off state of IGCT. It is important to reduce the volume of the device, enhance the lifetime of the product, and extend application areas.",

High switching frequency and small rise/fall times drive for high efficiency, but due to the increased time derivative of the current, PCB parasitic effects caused a change of the design approach moving from a two layer to a four layer PCB design to avoid ringing and over-undershoot scenarios with the risk of damaging the semiconductor devices. Considerations related to an optimization of the PCB concern the EMI problems that are of high interest especially in the automotive field where it can be included the application object of this study. This work shows an extension of the previous investigation in optimizing the layout of the four layer PCB further by means of simulating mode conversion in the gate source wiring for the three phases and studying the impact of some layout parameters. Results obtained with different PCB model are compared for different design iterations.",

Previous studies using motorette tests on single wound teeth of segmented stators demonstrated varying impregnation goodness. It is the result of a stochastic resin trickle impregnation process. This paper presents results of a DC test on a complete stator made with the same settings of the resin trickle impregnation process. The stator was instrumented with a number of temperature sensors at various locations. A large variation in winding temperature from tooth to tooth is shown. It correlates to the variation in the impregnation goodness of the segments as expected. However, the calibrated lumped parameter thermal network model from the motorette tests failed to predict accurately the transient behaviour of the stator during the DC tests. An improved thermal model is presented accounting for the resin heat capacity and the actual resin weight in the stator during the calibration, leading to more accurate transient simulations.",

        "abstract": "For an airborne radar system, the detection of slow-moving targets under the ground clutter has become the research hotspot to worldwide scholars. In order to reduce the minimum detectable velocity (MDV) of moving target, an airborne multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar based on time-domain frequency diversity is studied in this paper. The signal model of time-domain frequency diversity MIMO radar is established. Then, by exploiting the idea of range compensation in the frequency diversity array space-time adaptive processing (FDA-STAP), a slow target detection method is given by using a priori range cell information. Simulation results indicate that the frequency step between pulses can separate the slow target from the main clutter area, which is beneficial to the detection of slow targets. The correctness and effectiveness of our analysis are verified through the computer simulation.",

        "abstract": "To solve the problem that the true target direction of arrival (DOA) is not on the discrete grid points, we adopt a new off-grid sparse strategy to estimate the target DOA of passive radar. This strategy is the root sparse Bayesian learning method, which utilizes a coarse grid and treats the sampling position in the coarse grid as an adaptive parameter. Then, the coarse mesh is iteratively refined using the expectation maximization algorithm, and the estimated angle is the root of a certain polynomial. Simulation results show that the method has higher estimation accuracy and lower computational complexity in DOA estimation of passive radar. In addition, this method can not only estimate the DOA of multi-target signals in a single snapshot, but also provide new ideas for DOA estimation of coherent signals.",

It is found that in addition to the PM and reluctance torque components produced by each winding set, the mutual inductance between two winding sets also contributes to the overall output torque, as a reluctance torque component. With the frozen permeability method, the instantaneous torque components can be separated appropriately, which can provide more insights for the design and control of DTP PM machines.",

        "abstract": "SAR imaging and moving target detection are hot research topics in the radar literature. SAR involved one-bit sampling is a promising technology for many civilian applications due to its low-cost and low-power consumptions. This paper presents a novel one-bit method for detecting moving targets in SAR images. The proposed method is applied to the signal after dechirp processing. Based on the one-bit quantization, the method introduces a static frequency offset to the original signal, which decreases the spectrum interference of the higher harmonics. In addition, combined with displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) technique, the moving targets are effectively detected after compensation of the two channel one-bit SAR images. Finally, compared with the straightforward one-bit sampling scheme, the efficiency of the proposed method and the relevant conclusion are verified by the simulation results.",

        "abstract": "The expansion of renewable energies and the resulting decentralization of the electricity production poses major challenges for electricity grids. A solution approach for this problem is the creation of self-sufficient (island mode) microgrids. Since the electricity required in such a microgrid is primarily produced and consumed locally (up to 100 %), less electricity has to be transported over long distances via cables. However, the goal of keeping the degree of selfsufficiency of a microgrid reliably on a high level turns out to be a difficult task due to various constraints such as the composition of the local electricity production or the additional consideration of electric vehicles. In order to address this problem, this paper presents a two-step optimization methodology which allows to increase the degree of selfsufficiency of a microgrid based on a composition of local power plants, consumers and electric vehicles. To implement the methodology, two Computational Intelligence (CI) metaheuristics are applied and compared: Simulated Annealing (SA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). On the basis of an example scenario as well as extensive, aggregated test runs, the results show that the proposed methodology is capable of reliably increasing the degree of self-sufficiency of a microgrid.",

        "abstract": "The transmission of pulses with different intra-pulse modulations within a coherent processing interval (CPI), also known as pulse-agile radar, has several potential applications. For the detection of small targets with long range and slow velocity in the background of strong clutter, the conventional pulse-Doppler (PD) radar is limited by range ambiguity and folded clutter. It is feasible to solve this problem through the agility between pulses. In this paper, a non-repeating, spectrum modulated nonlinear frequency modulation (NLFM) waveform applicable for pulse agility radar is described. Based on the spectrum structure of linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal, the waveform modulates its power spectral density by a random sinusoid to achieve good cross-correlation properties, which can suppress the range ambiguity and folded clutter. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Human activity classification is a critical part of intelligent human-computer interaction, which is promising in various applications. The radar system provides a complementary input when the visible light cannot work. It can effectively tackle darkness, occlusion, and non-line-of sight conditions. The frequency modulation induced by the micromotion of human movements can be captured and utilized by radar systems. Currently, the integration of deep learning methods and classical signal processing has been more and more prominent in the radar-based human behaviour sensing field. In this work, we propose a compact deep learning model to classify various human activities by the corresponding frequency modulation. Considering most deep neural networks are both data-hungry and resource-hungry, we integrate transfer learning and network pruning techniques to reduce the number of labelled training samples and computational burden. The experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms convolutional neural networks trained from scratch but also significantly slims its model size and computing operations.",

        "abstract": "Protecting an inverter-dominated microgrid is challenging for the traditional overcurrent protection scheme owing to the suppressed fault current from the inverter interfaced DGs (IIDGs). In this paper, a protection scheme based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK to detect the faults in the microgrid. The input voltage of the proposed scheme is first transformed into dq0 frame using the Park Transform. A filtering system based on the wavelet denoising approach is then implemented to reduce the sampling frequency and reject the switching noise generated by the inverters in the microgrid. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in transient simulation by systematically applying different types of faults, including varied fault positions and impedances. Additionally, a high impedance arcing fault model is implemented to test the proposed protection scheme under nonlinear fault impedance conditions.",

Manually disease detection requires enormous amount of work, and also requires the too much processing time, therefore image processing play important role for the detection of crop plant diseases. The proposed method automatic segment and classify different leaf disease regions from the plant images. The proposed method works on three steps: In the first step, pre-processing is applied on the plant image that be made of median filter and contrast stretching in order to remove the digitization noise and enhance the contrast of the image, respectively. In the second step, K-means clustering algorithm is employed on L*a*b* color model of leaf image that segments pixels into uniform sets. These segments then are converted into HSV color model and the segment that has maximum hue value among other segments are extracted as a disease segment. Finally, feature are extracted from disease segment and apply machine learning i.e. Multi SVM classifier to classify crop image into various class based on various diseases on crop images. Proposed technique is implemented on Matlab 14a.To conduct the experiments on different plant image we have used various crop disease images from various source. Accuracy of our proposed system is approx. 86.67%. Keywords:",

All the water resources like rivers, lakes, ponds etc. are polluted by the industrials wastes and sewerage. Public concern over the environmental impact of wastewater pollution has increased. Several wastewater treatment techniques are used to clean the water using Physicochemical treatment and Biological treatment processes. Coagulation, flocculation, activated sludge processes have been applied to remove the pollutants. This paper proposes an intelligent wastewater treatment process to remove contaminants from wastewater such as halogenated hydrocarbon compounds, heavy metals, dyes, pesticides, and herbicides, which represent the main pollutants in wastewater. We propose this project to have water treatment plant in every house so that reuse of wastewater could become a reality and water scarcity problem could be solved.",

        "abstract": "Today, distribution system hosting capacity studies for distributed solar photovoltaics (PVs) and other distributed energy resources (DERs) are based on worst-case scenarios that assume DERs operate in unmanaged or unconstrained ways. Under the current paradigm, DER hosting capacity can be limited or costly grid upgrades may be required due to potential, but infrequent, worst-case conditions. DER management systems (DERMS) can enable additional DER to be interconnected as a managed resource that is curtailed to avoid violations under the infrequent worst-case conditions. This scheme, referred to as flexible interconnection, allows the interconnection of more DER while resulting in a minimal reduction in productivity to DER owners. This study assesses the techno-economic value of flexible interconnection for PV enabled by DERMS through detailed modelling and analysis of a real North American distribution feeder. It focuses on using DERMS to avoid distribution system upgrades due to thermal overloads and illustrates the economic value of a flexible interconnection arrangement across a range of PV system capacities. Findings indicate that the value of a flexible interconnection arrangement diminishes for PV systems with larger DC/AC ratios and as interconnected PV capacity increases, given increased amounts of curtailment.",

This paper proposes design guidelines for the interconnection of DC-link film capacitors to the power module in order to achieve a small parasitic inductance in the current commutation loop. The results are considered to develop a low inductance DC-Link design. This paper contributes to the design of film capacitors as well as capacitor banks and the connection to the power module. Detailed analysis of different parts of the DC-link should provide a closer look to main parasitic design parameters of an inverter system. This paper concludes with the introduction of a low inductance integrated inverter system.",

Technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and tangible interaction helped in bridging the gap between the physical world and the digital world. Moreover, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology helped in digitalizing the physical environment, adding enormous interaction capabilities. This research paper is an attempt to develop a theoretical framework for integrating VR and IoT technologies in the interior design process. Specially, the suggested framework will be used to test the users’ preferences of artificial lighting variations in virtual reality model of a typical guestroom in “Five Stars” hotel. The IoT contribution in the framework will be through controlling the “Intensity” parameter of artificial lighting based on variations in other internal design elements and external environmental factors. The framework can be used as a design tool to help the interior designer in determining the appropriate intensity of artificial light needed in a typical “5 stars” guest room in order to enhance the guest’s satisfaction level.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has impacted human lives from different aspects during the last months. The number of recorder cases is increasingly growing. The infection rate spikes due to unprotected contact with people with fever or respiratory symptoms. Fever is one of the common symptoms of corona virus infection. Thus, measuring the body temperature and tracing its change is an important indicator. It is a recommended practice to inspect suspected cases. For campuses with big number of residents and visitors, monitoring the temperature arises a new challenge as it requires huge number of trained medical staff and imposes the direct contact between the medical staff and the person under test. Also, this practice requires the direct contact between the medical staff and the person under test, which may cause the transmission of the virus. In this paper a non-contact autonomous smart thermometer system is proposed. The thermometer measures forehead temperature remotely, without the need for human operation. The system indicates the person identity and records the measured temperature enabling the tracing of temperature of engaged persons and further analysis of gathered data. In this paper, the system architecture and the implementation of the proposed system is described. Testing and verification processes demonstrate its effectiveness and feasibility.",

The experimental results on six ritual categories of the final 300 datasets show that the classification accuracy of catboost algorithm is 87.5%, and the recall rate is 86.7%. The Dongba text data set is not perfect, meanwhile, the types of rituals and the number of texts in the corpus can be further enriched.This study attempts to use catboost algorithm to solve the problem of text classification in Dongba classics. Experiments show that the algorithm is reasonable and effective, and has practical application value.",

        "abstract": "A review of the latest load forecasting techniques will be presented in this paper, in the context of different scale and horizons. Today, the competitive energy market demands more accurate forecasting at different scales, ranging from a single smart-meter (end-user) up to a whole power grid system. As a result of this market need, load forecasting is considered today as an essential part of the electricity industry’s planning process. In other hand the large volumes of data generated by the vast amount of smart meters calls for intelligent methods and solutions for the real-time data analytics. Although some past review papers investigate load forecasting, but a very few reviews are done by considering all different scales and horizons. An up to date survey of load forecasting techniques will also be presented by considering new trends such as distributed load forecasting, cloud computing techniques, real-time, and stream processing algorithms.",

Sparse aperture data completion based on sparse representation by CAMP algorithm is proposed. After the completion data is obtained, the Keystone transform is used to correct the MTRC. The phase term of angular velocity compensation is constructed to compensate MTCC. The minimum entropy corresponding to angular velocity is searched by golden section method. Based on the imaging results of both scattering point model data and electromagnetic calculation data, it is verified that the proposed method can effectively correct the migration through resolution cell under the condition of sparse aperture and obtain high resolution images.",

This is needed to improve vehicle operation during acceleration and to avoid dynamic current stress of the fuel cell stack. The battery is used for regenerative braking and is connected to the DC-bus of the drive train via a bidirectional DC-DC converter. This paper investigates non-isolated hard-switched bidirectional DC-DC converters with voltage and current ratings which are common in fuel cell hybrid vehicles. The focus is on the comparative analysis of converters regarding the current and voltage stress as well as on the passive component design. Furthermore, a general evaluation for the use in fuel cell hybrid vehicles is discussed.",

A waveform design method, which adopts linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse train based on pulse width agility, is proposed. The optimized pulse train, which is obtained by constructing pulse width agile waveforms and optimizing through dynamic programming, has good performance on suppressing range ambiguity and folded clutters. Besides, after joint mismatched filtering, the pulse-Doppler (PD) processing result of the pulse train shows excellent characteristics in both range and Doppler dimensions. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The sub-module will withstand a very high voltage if a fault occurs in MMC converter station. In order to reduce this voltage, the LCC converter must operation in inversion state through gate-shift (GS) control strategy as quickly as possible. Normally, the fault signal was sent to LCC station through communication and GS control strategy was triggered due to this signal. Even though, the time lag between fault time and GS triggering time is as long as 60ms. In this long time lag, the sub_module (SM) voltage will be charged up to 4270V, which is very danger for IGBT. The solution of distributed dissipation resistor installed in SM is proposed in this paper and recommended values were also given out. Simulation works based on PSCAD are conducted to verify this method. The simulation results show that the proposed solution is valid.",

        "abstract": "Based on the fact that the servo motor control requires high reliability of resolver, this paper studies the fault diagnosis mechanism based on the integrated resolver decoder chip AD2S1210, and conclude that the excitation, sine, cosine signal and the fault output signals are susceptible when used for fault diagnosis which leads to a high false alarm rate. At the same time, the disturbance of the decoded value may cause a certain deviation in the detection of the resolver position when a false alarm occurs, which directly affects the accuracy of the servo motor control. From the perspective of application, this paper proposes a resolver fault diagnosis and position synthesis algorithm based on information fusion and model prediction. Based on the AD2S1210 fault detection, this algorithm uses information fusion and model prediction methods to detect resolver faults and predict position so as to reduce the position fluctuations when a false alarm occurs. The algorithm is simulated and then tested on an experimental system. The test data is compared with the fault diagnosis data based on AD2S1210 fault detection before the improvement. The results show that: after executing the algorithm, the false alarm rate is reduced to a certain extent, and the position meanwhile is smoother than before. This algorithm does not need additional system hardware cost, and can also be realized and integrated in the motor control software. The software consumes less resources and has higher engineering application value.",

As the novel sensorless control strategy estimate the rotor position by using different harmonics, it can lead to a good torque response compared to the classical strategy, specially in transient states. Therefore, in order to define the appropriate sensorless control strategy for the non-sinusoidal seven-phase PMSM, each sensorless control strategy will be highlighted in terms of robustness to the speed variation and torque ripple.

        "abstract": "For moving target detection with space-based array radar systems, the discrete side-lobe clutter caused by the isolated scatters or the moving scatters at antenna side-lobe direction, such as ships, small islands, buildings, power poles of the towers, and etc., usually has large power due to the wide antenna beams and shares the similar Doppler features with the real moving targets in the antenna main-lobe beam. The discrete side-lobe clutter cannot be well suppressed by using the space-time adaptive processing (STAP) and thus to result in false alarms. To address the issue, an orthogonal projection filter is deigned to suppress the discrete side-lobe clutter for space-based radar systems. In this method, the “potential targets”, including the real moving targets and the discrete side-lobe clutter, are firstly pre-selected after the STAP. Then, for the range-Doppler cells of the potential targets, the corresponding orthogonal projection filters are designed based on the differences of the space-time steering vectors between the discrete side-lobe clutter and the real moving targets. After applying the filters, the power of the discrete side-lobe clutter can be reduced significantly, while that of the real moving targets would change little, making it available to eliminate the false alarms. Finally, the theoretical analysis and the airborne radar experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to measure the temperature of the gallium-nitride power devices using temperature sensitive electrical parameters. The temperature dependence of the quasi-threshold voltage is used in this paper to measure the device temperature. To analyse the temperature behaviour of the quasi-threshold voltage in gallium-nitride transistors, static measurements are performed. A gallium-nitride transistor with a rating of 600 V/26 A in half bridge configuration is used for the dynamic measurements. The voltage drop across the parasitic inductance between power and Kelvin source is used to trigger the data acquisition circuit which also prevents false triggering while keeping low noise susceptibility. The novelty of this paper lies in the successful implementation of this robust and easy-to-implement method to measure temperatures of Gallium-Nitride power devices.",

The proposed strategy aims to minimize the total transmit power while guaranteeing a predetermined the mean-square error (MSE) threshold for target location position and velocity estimation, which is evaluated by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). In order to solve the underlying optimization problem, a Two-Step technique, which exploits the heuristic algorithm and the semidefinite programming (SDP) method, is introduced. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the developed Two-Step solution algorithm has much higher efficiency when compared with the exhaustive search approach, and the presented strategy can also provide superiority over other existing schemes in terms of the achievable LPI performance.",

In view of the fault isolation requirement, resonant switches are equipped in the Zhoushan VSC-MTDC system, however, the influence of overvoltage on the resonant switch when the DC system fault is not fully considered. In this paper, the problem of resonant switch overvoltage in Zhoushan VSC-MTDC system was analysed, and the dynamic process and the insulation effect on existing equipment of single-pole fault overvoltage after one transmission line exit operation was described. Finally, the corresponding modification measures was proposed. The work in this paper provided a reference for the safe and stable operation of the resonant switch in VSC-MTDC system.",

The performance of traditional SEI technique based on expert knowledge and hand-crafted emitter features is limited in engineering, since the designing of features is essentially subject to a certain application scenario and radio environment. To provide a universal SEI method, this paper proposes a novel strategy using adaptive feature generation and deep learning architecture. In particular, the technique of empirical mode decomposition is performed on the non-stationary received signal, and further converted into a grey-scale image. Then a convolutional neural network is applied for feature extraction and emitter identification. In the experiment, we first build a dataset with same intermediate frequency tone signals from four identical Keysight E8267D signal sources with different output power. Then the performance of the proposed method is studied on this dataset, the results indicate that our method is effective for emitter identification.",

The mathematical model of the dual three-phase PMSM is established based on a proposed vector decoupling method which can be used in both pre-fault and post-fault models. Reference stator currents relationship in fault condition is also analyzed and deduced in this paper. Based on the developed model, PIR controllers are introduced to suppress the second harmonic currents.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates a simple and cost-effective phase current measurement technique for a three-phase switched reluctance motor (SRM), considering its independent phase current control and fault diagnosis of power converter. Unlike conventional current measurement methods, only two current sensors are utilized in such a way that one is installed in the upper bus, and the other is placed in the lower dc-bus to measure the bus currents. In order to extract the phase currents from the measured bus currents, switching functions are rearranged such that during single active region the upper switches chop, while the lower switches remain closed during the phase turn-on region. During commutation region, the upper switches of the incoming phase will remain closed, while the lower switches will perform the chopping function. However, the outgoing phase will observe the same switching function as that of single active region. Furthermore, utilizing the same two sensors without additional devices, the typical open-and short-circuit faults of power diodes are analyzed. Thorough simulations are carried out on a three-phase 12/8 SRM to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.",

The objective of the proposed study is to analyse the needs and requirements of existing and emerging electricity markets for flexibility to work as a bridge between flexibility providers and users. The proposed study focuses on issues like coordination between stakeholders, data exchange, interoperability, liquidity and rules and structures essential for an accessible and viable flexibility trade. More often, flexibility will be located in distribution grids and distribution system operator might require flexibility themselves. The coordination of flexibility trading becomes more complicated when an aggregated prosumer flexibility impacts multiple stakeholders. The particular focus of the proposed study is to describe and analyse the needs and requirements of flexibility in markets and how they could be integrated as a part of the overall electricity market environment.",

        "abstract": "Real-time monitoring and situational awareness are often a prerequisite to enable the intelligent management of distribution grids and to step into the smart grid paradigm. Despite the research efforts to design state estimation tools tailored to the distribution system, achieving real-time monitoring at distribution level is still a major challenge. One of the main problems is the scarce number of measurement devices available in the field. Pseudo-measurements, namely forecasts of power consumption or generation, are usually introduced to deal with this issue. Nonetheless, defining meaningful pseudo-measurements is not a trivial task and it can represent a barrier, from a practical perspective, for the deployment of the monitoring system. This paper presents a new formulation of the distribution system state estimation problem that avoids defining pseudo measurements and allows running state estimation using only few real-time measurements in combination with the nominal data of the connected loads or generators. Performed tests prove that the proposed algorithm can be an effective solution to easily deploy state estimation in poorly instrumented grids, avoiding the complexities and potential issues associated to the use of pseudo-measurements.",

In order to solve the problem of small inertia of DC microgrid, a virtual inertial control strategy with exponential change is proposed based on U-I droop control to slow down the voltage shock caused by disturbance of the system. The DC microgrid system is built in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can increase the inertia of DC system for a short time, suppress DC voltage oscillation, effectively improve the transient response of DC voltage disturbance and improve the operation stability of the system when the power shortage suddenly occurs.",

        "abstract": "Grid stability is directly proportional to the voltage control, which becomes complex when multiple grids are involved. Due to the increasing trend of renewable energy integration and smart grid systems, a multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) grid system is the trending approach in the power system. Voltage control strategies like voltage margin control, master-slave control, etc. have some drawbacks associated with them. Such as the generation of oscillations, delayed time response, etc. A new centralized Voltage droop control strategy for voltage source converter (VSC) is proposed. The aspiration of this strategy comes from the frequency control in the AC system. Voltage control in the DC system is the counterpart of frequency control in the AC system. The unified voltage droop control strategy balances the instantaneous power amongst all converters in case of any disturbance. All the converters automatically adjust themselves to maintain the balance of power within the DC grid based on the measurement of terminal voltage. Resulting in minimum overshoot, minimum undershoot, instantaneous fault clearing, and fast settling time. A four-terminal VSC-MTDC system is simulated in the PSCAD environment to test the performance of the unified or centralized voltage droop control strategy.",

        "abstract": "In the existing research, it is evident that cooperation is essential for the development of new innovations. Organisations in the energy sector are undergoing fundamental changes as a cleaner and more efficient energy supply is demanded. To this end, distribution system operators (DSOs) and transmission system operators (TSOs) increasingly need to cooperate, share knowledge and jointly develop new innovative products. Within this innovation process, knowledge from DSOs and TSOs is required, which has to be recombined and exchanged between both actors. This research paper aims to determine what knowledge needs to be exchanged between DSOs and TSOs in order to develop new innovative ways of exchanging data and thus shape joint cooperation in the future energy system. To answer this question, 13 interviews with experts from the distribution, transmission and research field have been conducted. The interviews were realised with project partners from the EU Horizon 2020 project TDX-ASSIST that aims to develop a data exchange platform. For the future energy system, communication via data exchange platforms will play an increasingly important role as more information and communication technology (ICT) related and distributed knowledge will be exchanged.",

        "abstract": "A light field image can achieve a realistic visualization of a complex scene because it contains directional information and intensity information of light; however, its advantages cannot be fully realized due to the limited angular range of a light field camera. For this reason, we processed a light field focal stack with a masked back projection algorithm to reconstruct the panoramic light field sub-aperture image and thereby achieved the goal of expanding the angular field of view of the light field. The method described in this paper consists of two main parts: focal stack stitching and panoramic light field reconstruction. To stitch a focal stack, two depth cues were fused to extract high-precision index maps for generating high-quality all-in-focus images and for calculating the transformation relationship between light fields. To generate a panoramic light field, we use a masked back projection algorithm to process the panoramic focal stack and to reconstruct a sharp panoramic light field sub-aperture-images. Finally, we demonstrate the generation of high-quality, all-in-focus images and sharp panoramic light-field sub-aperture-images with no loss of the field of view.",

The solutions leveraged the sparseness of extremely large matrices in real-time electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation. The FPGA implementation of sparse LU decomposition and modified Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury(SMW) formula in matrix inversion is presented. This resource-aware implementation tackled the resource bottleneck on FPGA-based sparse matrix inversion. Through a novel one matrix structure storage scheme, we finally achieved resource-reduced on the premise of maintaining speed and accuracy. Although the solutions are tailored for power electronics simulation systems, they can also be universalized in many other sparse-matrix-led fields due to its versatility. The resource consumption, performance, and accuracy are evaluated and compared. Our solution is proven to perform excellently.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a method for wind turbine clutter (WTC) recognition and mitigation based on support vector machine (SVM) and sparse reconstruction is proposed. First, the wavelet transform is performed on the signal to construct a feature vector based on the WTC radar echo model, and a support vector machine is utilized to recognize whether a WTC is exist. Second, a dictionary will be constructed for strong interference components of WTC, before utilizing sparse reconstruction to separate WTC signal. As a result the target signal will be reserved, achieving the mitigation of WTC. The effectiveness of this proposed method is demonstrated through simulation results.",

        "abstract": "Gate threshold voltage is a classic thermo-sensitive electrical parameter (TSEP) for the junction temperature estimation and the gate oxide degradation, which is considered as a promising precursor for the online condition monitoring of power MOSFET. However, due to the fast switching transient, the gate threshold voltage of SiC MOSFET is much more difficult to measure than its Si counterpart. More specifically, the conventional measurement method mentioned in the datasheet obtains the gate threshold voltage during the turn-on transient, which requires the measurement to be completed within tens of nanoseconds. This paper presents a new approach to evaluate the gate threshold voltage with the assistance of a current-source gate driver. The advantage of the proposed measurement method is its lower requirement for the bandwidth of the measurement circuit, compared with the conventional method. The principle of the proposed method is demonstrated, followed by the simulation validation. A current-source gate driver is designed and constructed to assess the proposed method in experiment which shows that the measurement results can be used to evaluate the junction temperature effectively.",

        "abstract": "Featuring high sensitivity, good linearity and compact structure, rotary variable differential transformer (RVDT) is widely used in automatic control systems in aerospace such as the aircraft nose-wheel steering system, the rudder control system and the inlet control system. In the RVDT design process, both the uniformity of the internal magnetic field and the rationality of structural process shall be addressed to optimize the structural parameters on the precondition of meeting performance requirements. This paper selects a typical RVDT structure as the research subject, and identifies that the selection of the slot width of the stator core is key to improve process rationality and manufacturing efficiency. A structure optimization scheme is put forward by simulation based on different structural parameters and verified by tests. This optimized structure greatly improves the manufacturing efficiency, and the research findings can be applied to the development of redundant RVDT, which provides strong support for accelerating R&D of such products",
