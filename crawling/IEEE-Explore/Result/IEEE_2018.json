The measurements and data processing are conducted in such a way to meet requirements for a fair comparison of large- and small-scale channel parameters between the two bands. Our results reveal that there is high spatial-temporal correlation between 28 and 140 GHz channels, similar numbers of strong multipath components, and only small variations in the large-scale parameters between the two bands. Furthermore, when including the weak paths there are higher total numbers of clusters and paths in 28 GHz as compared to those in 140 GHz bands. With these similarities, it would be very interesting to investigate the potentials of using 140 GHz band in the future mobile radio communications."

The band offers large theoretical data rates with reasonable path loss to theoretically allow even up to kilometer long link distances when sufficiently high gain antennas are used. The molecular absorption loss in the band requires a large number of parameters from spectroscopic databases, and, thus, the exact modeling of its propagation characteristics is demanding. In this paper, we provide a simple, yet accurate absorption model, which can be utilized to predict the absorption loss at the above frequency band. The model is valid at a regular atmospheric pressure, it depends on the distance, the relative humidity, and the frequency. The existing simplified model by ITU does not cover frequencies above 350 GHz and has more complexity than our proposed model. The molecular absorption loss increases exponentially with the distance, decreasing the utilizable bandwidth in the vicinity of the absorption lines. We provide a model to approximate the window widths at the above frequency band. This model depends on the distance, the relative humidity, the frequency, and the maximum tolerable loss. It is shown to be very accurate below one kilometer link distances."

        "abstract": "Regression testing is crucial but can be extremely costly. Regression Test Selection (RTS) aims to reduce regression testing cost by only selecting and running the tests that may be affected by code changes. To date, various RTS techniques analyzing at different granularities (e.g., at the basic-block, method, and file levels) have been proposed. RTS techniques working on finer granularities may be more precise in selecting tests, while techniques working on coarser granularities may have lower overhead. According to a recent study, RTS at the file level (FRTS) can have less overall testing time compared with a finer grained technique at the method level, and represents state-of-the-art RTS. In this paper, we present the first hybrid RTS approach, HyRTS, that analyzes at multiple granularities to combine the strengths of traditional RTS techniques at different granularities. We implemented the basic HyRTS technique by combining the method and file granularity RTS. The experimental results on 2707 revisions of 32 projects, totalling over 124 Million LoC, demonstrate that HyRTS outperforms state-of-the-art FRTS significantly in terms of selected test ratio and the offline testing time. We also studied the impacts of each type of method-level changes, and further designed two new HyRTS variants based on the study results. Our additional experiments show that transforming instance method additions/deletions into file-level changes produces an even more effective HyRTS variant that can significantly outperform FRTS in both offline and online testing time."

Due to the great significance of user account linkage, there are increasing research works on this study. With the widespread popularization of GPS-enabled mobile devices, linking user accounts with location data has become an important and promising research topic. Being different from most existing studies in this domain that only focus on the effectiveness, we propose novel approaches to improve both effectiveness and efficiency of user account linkage. In this paper, a kernel density estimation (KDE) based method has been proposed to improve the accuracy by alleviating the data sparsity problem in measuring users' similarities. To improve the efficiency, we develop a grid-based structure to organize location data to prune the search space. The extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with the state-of-art methods."

There are no full nodes or lightweight nodes, all nodes are equal and contributing to the Section-Blockchain network. Experiments demonstrate that Section-Blockchain is efficient, remarkably reduced the storage, and withstand sudden nodes losing of massive scale. Section-blockchain also extended the capability of blockchain to the foundation of an autotrophic, tamper-resist decentralized storage system, in which, data can be equidistributional distributed worldwide automatically without any centralized dispatcher to assign storage; nodes are motivated to change their local storage to receive more remuneration.

We then add program stubs to complete the exploit. We evaluate Coppelia on three CPUs of different architectures. Coppelia is able to find and generate exploits for 29 of 31 known vulnerabilities in these CPUs, including 11 vulnerabilities that commercial and academic model checking tools can not find. All of the generated exploits are successfully replayable on an FPGA board. Moreover, Coppelia finds 4 new vulnerabilities along with exploits in these CPUs.

Current tools provide little help. We introduce INFOX, an approach to automatically identify non-merged features in forks and to generate an overview of active forks in a project. The approach clusters cohesive code fragments using code and network-analysis techniques and uses information-retrieval techniques to label clusters with keywords. The clustering is effective, with 90% accuracy on a set of known features. In addition, a human-subject evaluation shows that INFOX can provide actionable insight for developers of forks."

While CI environments provide advantages, they also utilize non-trivial amounts of time and resources. To address this issue, researchers have adapted techniques for test case prioritization (TCP) to CI environments. To date, however, the techniques considered have operated on test suites, and have not achieved substantial improvements. Moreover, they can be inappropriate to apply when system build costs are high. In this work we explore an alternative: prioritization of commits. We use a lightweight approach based on test suite failure and execution history that is highly efficient; our approach \"continuously\" prioritizes commits that are waiting for execution in response to the arrival of each new commit and the completion of each previously scheduled commit. We have evaluated our approach on three non-trivial CI data sets. Our results show that our approach can be more effective than prior techniques."

These startups operate in a dynamic environment, with significant time and market pressure, and rarely have time for systematic requirements analysis. Our theory describes the evolution of practice along six dimensions that emerged as relevant to their requirements activities: requirements artefacts, knowledge management, requirements-related roles, planning, technical debt and product quality. Beyond the relationships among the dimensions, our theory also explains the turning points that drove the evolution along these dimensions. These changes are reactive, rather than planned, suggesting an overall pragmatic lightness, i.e., flexibility, in the startups' evolution towards engineering practices for requirements. Our theory organises knowledge about evolving requirements practice in maturing startups, and provides practical insights for startups' assessing their own evolution as they face challenges to their growth. Our research also suggests that a startup's evolution along the six dimensions is not fundamental to its success, but has significant effects on their product, their employees and the company."

In this paper, we propose a new mechanism named MBM-EMD (i.e., multihop broadcast mechanism for emergency messages dissemination) to solve these problems. Our contributions are two-fold. i) We integrate multiple influencing factors such as vehicle density, relative movement, and channel quality into a new metric named ETGPH (i.e., the expected transmission gain per hop), and use it to select the optimal relays. ii) After acquiring the candidate set for further rebroadcast, the current sender firstly appoints an optimal relay from it to rebroadcast immediately. Other candidates will assist in forwarding according to our rules if this relay fails. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution."

We elaborate around design choices of various parts of the testbed, baseband hardware, required software and RF frontend. We also perform a thorough characterization of the testbed, in terms of I/Q imbalance, stability, frequency offset, DC offsets, and ADC/DAC clock rate offset. The study shows that the utilized design techniques for baseband and RF frontend hardware are feasible, and also that many hardware imperfections are possible to accurately characterize, for subsequent calibration and digital compensation."

Our work explores the use of User-Tailored Privacy (UTP) to adapt Facebook's privacy features to the user's personal preferences. We developed adaptive versions of 19 Facebook privacy features, and for each feature we test three adaptation methods (Automation, Highlight and Suggestion) that can be used to implement the adaptive behavior. In a \"think-aloud\" semistructured interview study (N=18), we show participants paper prototypes of our adaptive privacy features and ask participants to judge the presented adaptive capabilities and the three adaptation methods that implement them. Our findings provide insights into the viability of User-Tailored Privacy. Specifically, we find that the optimal adaptation method depends on the users' familiarity with the privacy feature and how they use them, and their judgment of the awkwardness and irreversibility of the implemented privacy functionality. We conclude with design recommendations for the implementation of User-Tailored Privacy on Facebook and other social network platforms."

In this study, a static method-granularity level change impact analysis, that uses program slicing and Bayesian Network technique has been proposed. The technique proposes a directed graph model that also represents the call dependencies between methods. In this study, an open source Java project with 8999 to 9445 lines of code and from 505 to 528 methods have been analyzed through 32 commits it went. Recall and f-measure metrics have been used for evaluation of the precision of the proposed method, where each software commit has been analyzed separately."

To understand what's missing from C++ API documentation and the factors influencing whether it will be fixed, we conducted a mixed-methods study involving two experience sampling surveys with hundreds of developers at the moment they visited implementation code, interviews with 18 of those developers, and interviews with 8 API maintainers. In many cases, updating documentation may provide only limited value for developers, while requiring effort maintainers don't want to invest.

From fabrication point of view, the proposed structure is very compatible with groove gap waveguide (GGW) technology which makes it a low loss and efficient solution for phase shifting at millimeter wave frequencies. A sample 9ff equal length differential phase shifter based on the proposed idea is designed and simulated for 60GHz band. Results show proper impedance matching and low insertion loss (less than 0.3dB) as well as providing 90±5° phase shift over the frequency range of 58–62.4 GHz."

Therefore, this paper presents a model of the wind rotor with adjustable accuracy and examines its influence on simulation results. Different wind effects that cause oscillating loads are analyzed using wind rotor models with varying accuracy.

The ionosonde was developed using SDR technology with transceiver platform USRP N210. The paper also discusses the features of signals of various shapes providing extra energy with a minimum transmission power and single antenna in the vertical-incidence sounding (VIS) mode. The algorithms for extracting a sounding signal from the background noise are presented. The algorithms of estimating current channel parameters were developed for determining channel state. They were used to estimate the availability of various separate channels. It was experimentally found that the diagnostics of the key parameters of a channel (delay and Doppler spread, SNR) allows to decrease the transmission power by 5 … 10 dB with a constant data transfer rate, or to increase the transfer rate up to twice with a constant transmission power."

To fill this gap, the German Aerospace Center conducted an extensive channel sounding measurements campaign in a controlled environment. The measurements were performed at 5.2 GHz with a bandwidth of 120 MHz. In parallel to the channel sounding measurements, performance measurements were carried out using ITS-G5 system at 5.9 GHz and with a bandwidth of 10 MHz. This paper describes the setup and the scenarios for the two measurements. First results on channel evaluation in different scenarios as well as path loss models are presented."

Empirical measurement results indicate that the radiation pattern, gain and direction of directional antennas significantly influence on properties of the received signal. This fact shows that consideration the directional antennas in propagation models is very important especially in the context of emerging telecommunication technologies such as beamforming or massive MIMO. The purpose of this paper is to present the modeling method of power angular spectrum and direction of antenna patterns in a multipath propagation environment."

The recent growth of the Virtual Reality market resulted in an intensification of development efforts in this technology. These days many teams and start-ups around the world are announcing imminent releases of commercial haptic gloves. Indeed, in the last year there has been one new product announcement almost every month. It is clear that not all new ideas will actually make it to the market, and that not all haptic gloves are addressing the same range of applications. In this paper, the main technical constraints which are faced when designing a haptic glove are addressed with a special focus of the actuation technology. Then, a review of existing devices, past and present projects, comparing their characteristics and performance is provided. Lastly, insights on future developments are sketched."

The antenna beam steering is obtained by changing the phase of reflection coefficient (S11) of the HIS through varying the separation between the HIS periodic array and ground layers. This is accomplished by employing direct current (DC) biased piezoelectric actuators (PEAs) on the ground layer. The antenna's simulated S11 bandwidth (BW), beam scanning range and maximum gain at 54.5GHz are about 3GHz, 43° in H-plane and 13.7dBi, respectively."

The second section introduces a revised array topology that extends the scanning range. The proposed solution is based on the introduction of an additional coupling mechanism within the structure. Its goal is to compensate the harmful effect of the surface wave, and it is implemented by means of additional microstrip lines connecting the array sources."

We propose a new varactor-based analog phase shifter in a broadband-matched bandpass configuration for a wide frequency range between 2–2.5 GHz. It enables continuous tuning of phase angles between 0° and 180°, which are steered by only one bias voltage. By cascading two implementations of the proposed circuit or in combination with a switchable wideband 0°/180° phase shifter all phase values between 0° and 360° can be obtained with low frequency dependence. The combination with a switchable phase shifter enables a higher usable bandwidth and offers the additional capability of selecting individual antennas in a multi-antenna system. After an analytic explanation of the phase shifter circuit, simulated and measured results of a hardware sample are presented and the influence of parasitic effects is discussed. A matching of better than 10 dB and attenuation of less than 2.5 dB is achieved for all phase constellations. Measurements of a phased array for satellite radio reception around 2.33 GHz using the new phase shifter clearly show the good performance of the circuit even with its small footprint and low component count. Continuous-valued beam steering in azimuth as well as discrete beam steering in elevation is achieved by the combination of a switchable with the new continuously tunable phase shifter."

Full probe compensation techniques have been introduced in recent publications, supporting the use of extreme bandwidth (more than a decade) antennas as probes with no loss in measurement accuracy.

This is achieved by locating between the radiation elements a smaller patch with metamaterial decoupling structure (MTM-DS). In this case the radiating elements are circular patches and the MTM-DS is constructed from a hexagonal slit resonator. The consequence of implementing the MTM-DS patch is significant reduction in mutual coupling between adjacent radiating patches by 60%, improvement in impedance match by 200% and substantial increase in the antenna's fractional bandwidth by 369%. Since the ground plane is unaltered the front-to-back ratio is unaffected too. The proposed technique is easily realizable and can be used effectively in beam scanning applications."

One scheme to achieve WPT is the use of a pair of printed spiral coils (PSC) acting as a transmitter and receiver. Optimization of the physical configuration of these PSC's is needed for maximum power transfer efficiency and tolerance to angular and lateral misalignment. This paper presents a new analytical model for the calculation of the self- and mutual inductances, AC resistance, and parasitic capacitance to design compact spiral PSC's for WPT applications. The proposed analytical model enables the rapid calculation of the power transfer efficiency (PTE) analysis of a spiral WPT system. A complete optimization model is also implemented in MATLAB. Furthermore, all analytical results have been validated using the 3D electromagnetic (EM) software ANSYS MAXWELL 3D combined with Agilent ADS circuit simulator."

This method allows one to quantify both the energy radiating outward into free space and the reactive portion of the reversing electromagnetic field which affects the efficiency of the transmitter. The ability to examine the Poynting vector variation relative to the changing phase of 0, 30, and 90 degrees between two active elements of the array antenna provides information about beam strength and direction of propagation. This method elucidates the effect of the phase shift on wave propagation direction, back-scattering, and power density."

In this study, a pseudo chirp pulse with proper (<5.5) time-bandwidth (TB) product is considered as the carrier. Pulse compression filter is also developed that is formed by the pseudo chirp matched filter convoluted with the Barker code mismatched filter. In the simulation, the pulse compression filter is well performed to suppress sidelobes below -40 dB roughly. Simulation results show that in comparison with conventional Barker coded excitation using sinusoid carrier (called Sinusoid-Barker), the axial resolution of Pchirp-Barker coded excitation is doubly improved with the SNR loss of less than 1 dB. And the SNR can be improved by about 4 dB with the same axial resolution. Simulation of B-mode images with the Field II program is carried out to demonstrate that the axial resolution is improved from 0.7 mm to 0.4 mm. In addition, the Pchirp-Barker coded excitation has the advantages of binary-coded waveform and simple pulser."

Typically, the entire vehicle is measured to account for the antenna coupling with the structure. At higher frequencies, sampling becomes challenging, due to the electrical size of most vehicles. However, distant scattering can often be ignored with acceptable accuracy. If the antenna is well centred in the measurement coordinate system, the sampling can thus be reduced to represent only the immediate vicinity of the antenna. The Translated Spherical Wave Expansion (TSWE) allows the user to arbitrary move the coordinate system within the measurement sphere during post-processing. Thus, avoiding the physical movement of the vehicle for centring during test. In this paper, the Advanced-TSWE (A-TSWE) with reduced computational complexity is presented for the first time. The efficiency and accuracy of A-TSWE is demonstrated by comparative measurement on a scaled mock-up representing a realistic SNF automotive measurement scenario."

This algorithm considers the data of the Italian calls for tenders, extracted through a crawling technique, and optimized through the proposed approach to obtain multiple solutions.

Both elements meet the criteria we have established based on experience with the previous system: dominant radiation in the imaged domain, radiation symmetry and no need for a balun. The work deals with the verification of the fulfillment of the desired antenna properties and the mutual comparison of the two antenna elements by means of numerical simulations. Although both antenna elements exhibit the desired properties, the bowtie slot antenna exhibits lower internal losses compared to the rectangular waveguide-based antenna. This increases the magnitude of the transmission coefficients in our microwave imaging system by about 13 dB to about −74 dB (for the most distant antennas of the system) for the bowtie slot antenna (in comparison to the rectangular waveguide-based antenna). In addition, it can be expected that for this antenna element it will be easier to guarantee the reproducebility of the production and thus reduce the differences of the individual antenna elements in the antenna array of the microwave imaging system."

        "abstract": "The combination of SCan-On-REceive with continuous variation of the pulse repetition interval during transmission (staggered operation) is a viable option for the acquisition of high-resolution-wide-swath SAR data. The data acquired in staggered mode is not uniformly sampled and contain gaps within the synthetic aperture mainly due to the interruption of reception during transmission (i.e, due to blockage). Hence, proper reconstruction strategies must be considered in order to minimize artifacts. Conventionally, large oversampling rates are required to ensure low ambiguity levels, but this is not always feasible due to data-rate constraints. Based on an existing two-step (recovery/re-sample) methodology, this paper proposes an strategy for reconstructing low-oversampled staggered data which improves the reconstruction of point-like targets while ensuring the best performance for distributed scatterers."

Some examples are the location of products in a warehouse or the quick location of patients, medical personnel or equipment in a hospital. A location system is necessary for health care, home care, stock control or inventory. In this context, this paper presents the design and implementation of a low-cost centralized indoor location system that uses BLE technology (Bluetooth Low Energy) together with the particle filter algorithm. Experimental results show that the system can achieve an accuracy of 1.8 m, at best, with an accuracy of 74% within 3 m. The cost of the infrastructure goes hand in hand with the number of objects or people to be located."

We propose the development of a cost-effective and affordable smart farming prototype that can detect plant diseases in advance and notify farmers so that remedial actions could be taken. Also, a web-based system has been developed to allow the farmers to monitor the status of their plants in the greenhouse. The development of such a smart farming plant disease detection system will allow farmers to have the ability to detect diseases at an early stage of the plants which will minimize yield loss from full-blown disease outbreak in their greenhouse. One important feature of this system is its ability to categorise the Septoria plant disease for which categorizing the stages of the disease outbreak on the leaf is very important. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that machine learning classification algorithm can be used in raspberry pi without losing performance. Based on our tests we also find that random forest classifier with colour histogram is the best combination to be run by this prototype for efficient plant disease detection."

The backscattering mechanism at small incidence angles is quasi-specular and the backscattered signal is calculated in the Kirchhoff approximation. A two-scale model is used to describe the sea surface and in this case, the Doppler spectrum of the microwave radar signal reflected by the sea surface explicitly depends on the second statistical moments of the large-scale part of sea wave spectrum. It is shown that having measured the shift and bandwidth of Doppler spectrum of the reflected signal the model wind waves spectrum can be retrieved and statistical parameters of sea waves such as significant wave height and average period can be obtained. The field experiment was carried out using the Ka-band narrow beam antenna and retrieved sea waves parameters were compared to measurements of string wave gauge, which proved the validity of the algorithm."

        "abstract": "The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission will carry L-band and S-band SAR instruments, each with a 240 km swath width. The L-band instrument has the capability to map the entire Earth's land and ice covered surfaces from both ascending and descending orbit positions, continuously in an exact 12 day repeating cycle, given temporally dense (better than 6-day on average) sampling of Earth over the life of the mission. To achieve this swath coverage without loss of resolution or polarimetric capability, NISAR uses a reflector-feed based antenna system with scan-on-receive (\"SweepSAR\") capability. One of the characteristics of SweepSAR is that the pulse repetition interval of the radar is shorter than the echo receive window for the 240 km swath. Therefore, transmit events occur during the receive window and the receivers must be blanked periodically, creating gaps in the coverage. For fixed pulse rate operations, these gaps are persistent strips of blanked ranges. NISAR is being designed to allow variation of the pulse rate in order to spread out these gaps throughout the synthetic aperture, but processing these variably-acquired data is more challenging and can lead to compromises in image quality. At the highest level NISAR places requirements on science measurements rather than image quality, so there is often a debate among science and engineering team members as to whether to operate with fixed pulse rates - leading to range strips consistently blank from cycle to cycle but with optimal image quality - or to vary the pulse rate, fill in the gaps, and live with degraded image quality. NISAR's performance team has shown that science requirements can be met with the gaps. However, scientists are eager for maximum and coverage within a swath. A companion paper (Villano et al.) describes image quality for NISAR using a variable PRF approach, but does not go further to science requirements. This paper explores the issues when gaps are present in the swath due to fixed PRF operations."

These requirements may be satisfied by implementing a smart logistic process. One important problem that is faced in that process is the bin packing problem. The bin packing is an NP-hard problem which focuses on optimizing the number of bins for a set of items with varying volumes and/or weights. Bin packing problem is used in many applications such as job scheduling, shipping items and placing data on multiple disks. Although many algorithms have been developed to solve the bin-packing problem, some drawbacks have remained unsolved like efficiency of the algorithm vs. optimal number of bins. In this research, we propose a multi-objective 3D bin packing algorithm that focuses on optimizing the number of bins as well as balancing the weight inside each bin. The proposed algorithm was implemented and tested with data gathered from FedEx. The computational results showed that the algorithm is efficient for a small number of problems and runs very fast for up to around 25000 items. The algorithm also balances the weights between the bins almost perfectly."

To this end, the paper explores the integration to TSO operations of the flexibility options provided by DSOs at the TSO-DSO interfaces, focusing specifically on short-term (real-time) active power balance satisfaction. The flexibility at a TSO-DSO interface is roughly modeled, after aggregation by the DSO, as active/reactive power box constraints inside which the DSO constraints are met. The paper develops a tailored AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem, supporting the TSO to cover active power deficit at least cost by the adjustment of conventional generators and flexibility options from ADSs, while integrating flexibility constraints at TSO-DSOs interface besides classical constraints. The interest and effectiveness of the proposed approach are illustrated using the Nordic32 system."

It is shown that on-chip calibration is preferred and provides more accurate de-embedding of parasitic effects. In addition, it is shown that the polarization purity is seriously affected by the coupling between AoC and probe tip."

        "abstract": "In practice, a program may contain multiple bugs. The simultaneous presence of these bugs may deteriorate the effectiveness of existing fault-localization techniques to locate program bugs. While it is acceptable to use all failed and successful tests to identify suspicious code for programs with exactly one bug, it is not appropriate to use the same approach for programs with multiple bugs because the due-to relationship between failed tests and underlying bugs cannot be easily identified. One solution is to generate fault-focused clusters by grouping failed tests caused by the same bug into the same clusters. We propose MSeer - an advanced fault localization technique for locating multiple bugs in parallel. Our major contributions include the use of (1) a revised Kendall tau distance to measure the distance between two failed tests, (2) an innovative approach to simultaneously estimate the number of clusters and assign initial medoids to these clusters, and (3) an improved K-medoids clustering algorithm to better identify the due-to relationship between failed tests and their corresponding bugs. Case studies on 840 multiple-bug versions of seven programs suggest that MSeer performs better in terms of effectiveness and efficiency than two other techniques for locating multiple bugs in parallel."

With quasi resonant switching method, the efficiency can be improved up to 90%. Although the efficiency improvement is significant, the total losses are large and they dominate the design of the converter due to the thermal considerations involving the reliability and the life of the power supply. Besides, it is hard to find a practical guide in order to estimate critical component power losses during design stage. For these reasons, a comprehensive power loss analysis is investigated for a quasi resonant flyback converter (QRFB) in this paper. For those purposes, a design procedure based on thermal considerations is presented, crucial loss items are illustrated on a basic schema and detailed calculations are done for 40 W universal power supply. Additionally, two methods are presented for transformer total loss measurement with a laboratory test setup. Evaluation of the results is also discussed at the end of the paper."

This has a significant impact on the design, developments, and testing of antennas embedded in 5G wireless devices. Fast and accurate antenna measurement systems are needed to satisfy the short developments and testing cycles to which today's antenna engineer are operating. Fast multi-probe systems is an established technology employed in fast and accurate measurement systems from 70MHz up to 18GHz. This paper describes a new multi-probe, near-field measurement system, in spherical geometry. The StarLab 50GHz is ideal for demanding antenna measurements for 5G applications in the 18 to 50GHz frequency range. Results from validation campaigns are also presented."

The matching network is optimized to match the antennas and load impedances. A decrease in conversion efficiency may be caused by the parasitic capacitance of the rectifier diode. To overcome this issue, we propose an improved detector topology. In this topology, a series inductor L is included in the conventional half bridge detector in order to compensate the effect of the rectifier parasitic capacitance. This LC resonance technique, significantly increases the available DC output power. Measured maximum values of the rectifier's RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of 30% and 50% have been obtained for input power levels ranging from −10 dBm and −2 dBm, at frequencies of approximately 1.84 GHz. The output DC voltage of the rectifier with two input signals of 0 dBm was measured to be 3.10 V at 1.84 GHz."

The feasibility of ML-ELM-AE on the classification of the Harmonic empirical data set will be probed, for when the classification results of the Harmonic load types become available, it can come in handy to power system analyst or engineers for analysis in later stage. They can use it to determine the harmonic distortion patterns and to characterize the harmonic currents at network buses. Depending on whether the aggregate load is residential, commercial, or industrial, the load characteristics in terms of its harmonic contents are likely to be different. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of the investigated technique in dealing with the real world power system application of harmonic load type classification, that can be useful in providing good indication to the power system or distribution network planner."

However, most traditional classification algorithms are incapable of recognizing unknown behaviors. To develop a high performance classification algorithm to improve the accuracy of IDS, the algorithm proposed in this paper will integrate clustering, classification, and metaheuristic algorithms as a classification algorithm for IDS, called search economics with k-means and support vector machine (SEKS). Moreover, this hybrid strategy for the proposed algorithm is aimed at improving the accuracy of abnormal behavior detection of such a system, reducing the computation time of a classification algorithm, and making it possible for the IDS to recognize the unknown and new variant attacks in a network environment. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms all the other classification algorithms compared in this paper in terms of the accuracy."

In this paper, we use data analytics-based techniques to study five large-scale software systems, examining the impact and the role of software architects who write code on software quality. Our quantitative study is augmented with a follow-up interview of architects. This paper provides empirical evidence for supporting the pragmatic opinions that architects should write code. Our analysis shows that implementing architectural tactics is more complex than delivering functionality, tactics are more error prone than software functionalities, and the architects tend to introduce fewer bugs into the implementation of architectural tactics compared to the developers."

The jointly reception of data streams features multiple access channel (MAC), where both data will be recovered by devising successive interference cancellation (SIC). Herein paper we show that in case of asynchronous reception, the propagation of errors through SIC causes huge loss of data frames and throughput degradation. Hence, we propose the channel model of the asynchronous NOMA, and we investigate the system's capacity region, where the information theoretic results show that the asynchronous reception of the data streams can indeed improve the sum-rate upper bounds."

The proposed method improved the output voltage characteristic through injecting several harmonics signals to the standard sine fundamental signal. This paper, firstly, calculated the MMF distribution of a set of multiphase windings. Then, based on it, the magnetic field distribution of multiphase induction motor was discussed, and three kinds of multiphase carrier PWM technologies are compared. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the proposed multiphase carrier PWM method based on harmonics injection can enhance the dc bus voltage utilization ratio effectively, improve motor torque density and efficiency, while has the characteristics of low torque ripple and simple realization."

Fabrication and measurement of 3D printed GRIN dielectric lens loaded horn confirm broadband operation, one step manufacturing, no need for post-processing, and the capability to reduce side-lobe levels. This is done without increasing the overall size of the system and the weight increase is insignificant."

        "abstract": "Acoustically transparent hearing devices should allow hearing equivalent to the open ear while providing the possibility to modify the sound reaching the eardrum in a desired manner. To this end, the output of the device is processed by means of an equalization filter, such that the superposition of the sound played back by the device and an acoustic sound component directly leaking into the ear canal approximates the transfer function to the open eardrum. A particular difficulty in designing the equalization filter is the occurrence of comb filtering effects due to a superposition of the direct sound and the delayed output of the device. Here, we propose a regularized least-squares design approach with a closed-form solution that takes into account individually measured transfer functions of the device and ear, as well as the processing delay. Experimental results utilizing measured transfer functions from a custom prototype device show good equalization performance, particularly a reduction of comb-filtering effects as a result of an automated frequency-dependent regularization."

Using the asymptotic correspondence for two- and three-dimensional problems of the antenna theory leads to simpler mathematical models for vertical dipole arrays. Numerical study of the mathematical models is based on iterative regularization of the ill-posed problem of reconstructing current distribution. It is proved that the suggested reconstruction method provides for the high accuracy and stability of the mathematical models of measuring systems even when random errors in measuring data are sufficient."

The proposed algorithm adds an update mechanism in the traditional energy detection process and maps the current channel state statistic by using the channel statistics of the previous detections. This algorithm is studied in the satellite cognitive network scenario, in which GEO satellite network is primary user, LEO satellite network is secondary user. Moreover, a spectrum sensing model is built to help study this algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of spectrum sensing and solves the problem that the power of the signal to be detected is constantly changing due to shadow effect."

This system analyzes hotel user reviews written in Myanmar language and performs the opinion mining tasks at the aspect level. Finally, the system classifies the aspects/features contained in the reviews as positive, negative or neutral. The important task of aspect level opinion mining is identifying the relations between aspects and opinion words in the reviews. This detection is a big challenge because of informal writing styles of reviews. Especially, it is a difficult task of aspect level opinion mining on Myanmar reviews due to the nature of Myanmar language. Therefore, the proposed system mainly focuses on extracting the relevant pairs of aspects and opinion words from the user reviews using the syntactic patterns and some linguistic rules."

Water budget (balance), a basic quantity of hydrology, is used to assess the amount of water in the ground needed for consumption. This is the reason why the water budget must also be calculated, even if the basic purpose is the groundwater level determination from GRACE data. Water budget computations are based on evapotranspiration and land surface hydrosphere state. The quantities required to calculate it can be obtained from land data assimilation systems, like American GLDAS (Global Land Assimilation System). In this paper, all the components of the water budget, like precipitation, surface run-off and evapotranspiration, are studied over the area of Poland. The resultant water budget is determined, interpreted and presented graphically."

In a GNSS-R system, the antenna plays a key role as a receiving component. In this paper, in-situ measurements using a commercial dual circular polarized antenna receiving both the left-hand and right-hand circular polarization reflected from the ground are analyzed. A low cost and compact dual-port circular polarized patch antenna is designed and realized to overcome the limitations of the previous configuration. The prototype shows a low level of cross polarization suitable for GNSS-R application."

The starting point is a 67 h near time numerical weather prediction data from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. A period of 3 months and for 3 sites in Norway have been studied. Based upon these accumulated 9 months of data, the precipitation along the satellite link to the ground terminal is calculated for every hour. The attenuation results from the model is compared to high accuracy contemporary measurements of the same path. If the forecast is predicting the presence of precipitation correctly, the predicted attenuation error has a low bias and the standard deviation value is typically in the order of 1.5 dB."

To deal with uncertainty issues caused by uncertain renewable power generation and loads, this paper proposes a two-stage robust operation approach for islanded MEMGs which coordinates diesel generators, combined heat and power plants with auxiliary boilers and thermal energy storage units in two operation stages, i.e. daily and hourly operation. The first-stage daily operation is optimized with the consideration of the second-stage hourly operation and the second-stage hourly operation is to compensate the first-stage operation, aiming to supply reliable and sufficient electric and thermal energy to customers in islanded MEMGs. This paper applies a robust optimization method, where the uncertainties are fully taken into account, to solve the proposed two-stage operation problem. The proposed two-stage robust operation approach is tested through Monte Carlo feasibility checks. The results show high operating robustness of the proposed approach for islanded MEMGs."

After establishing the differential drive motion model and odometry model, a visual line follower control algorithm is designed to give the appropriate pulse width modulation (PWM) control signal for differential drive of automatic vehicle based on imagine extraction, canny edge detector, center calculation and Kaiman filter update. That can make the automatic vehicle move with the requested linear and angular velocities. With the image segmentation, the background captured from the front camera can be suppressed and the line center can be accurately detected. In order to decrease the noise, a discrete Kaiman filter is used for tracking the line center. An error based on the difference between the image center and the line center is generated and used for steering the automatic devices follow the line. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can realize the path tracking based on imagine."

When operated at a duty ratio of 0.677, it has a gain of −2.1 compared to −1.1 for the regular q-ZSC, signifying an increased gain of 90.9%. The equation relating the gains of the two converters was also derived. Its additional capacitor and inductor belong to its impedance network thus permitting higher frequency operation, elimination of dead time, shoot-through effects etc. gives it advantage over a corresponding traditional buck-boost converter. Its operation and a corresponding buck-boost converter are compared and analyzed."

With the rapid increase of the power of airborne equipment and the limit of weight and volume, the traditional silicon based power devices cannot meet the needs of MEA. Gallium nitride (GaN) power devices have become one of the most promising devices for aviation inverter power due to their advantages of high efficiency, high frequency and high power density. However, when GaN device works in high frequency, the dv/dt and di/dt slopes increased due to stray inductances and parasitic capacitances, which lead to oscillations and overshoots in gate-source voltage and affect the stability of driving circuits. Especially in aviation inverter, crosstalk between GaN power device in bridge circuits severely limits the performance of the inverter and poses a challenge to the safety of aircraft power systems. In order to solve the short-circuit of bridge arms caused by crosstalk in the aircraft power supply system, an improved design of gate driving circuit was proposed, which can eliminate the parasitic oscillation and voltage spikes, suppress crosstalk and higher order harmonics effectively. In addition, a double pulse test prototype is built and the simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of this drive circuit. Therefore, applying this driving circuit to the aircraft DC-DC can effectively improve the reliability and robustness of the aviation GaN inverter."

This ISAR image is the result of the superposition of multiple ISAR images obtained by electromagnetic simulations based on a GO-PO method of the metallic target (without radar absorbing materials). The lowered RCS of the target covered with radar absorbing materials is estimated by a proper attenuation of the hotspots treated with radar absorbing materials in the single ISAR images.

But IM need to be attached with the gear mounted on the ceiling to reduce the speed. This contributes to the main problem of this application which is noise and vibration due to gear. In this research, the aim is to design a BLDC motor with of Double Stator Slotted Rotor Brushless DC Motor (DSSR-BLDC) topology to overcome the problem occurs in large ceiling fan application. Initially, DSSR-BLDC is designed using Permeance Analysis Method (PAM) to determine the motor sizing. By using PAM, the magnetic flux is calculated using magnetic circuit and mathematical modelling based on the direction of flux which flows in stator, rotor and air gaps. Secondly, the DSSR-BLDC model is analyze using Finite Element Method (FEM) to predict the back emf (BEMF), static torque and the transient torque. The result shows the DSSR-BLDC is able to produce 45 Nm of torques and fulfill the design restrictions. Finally, this research provides an overview of designing DSSR-BLDC for large ceiling fan application."

Furthermore, link budget analysis will be included to determine transmission range based on Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) requirement for TS-OOK modulation. The performance of single-user and multi-user communication inside human tissue has been done using simulation in three dimensions scenario. The results show the effective communication range for single-user models is limited to 1–2 mm. Moreover, the high node density and random pulse transmission among nano-network decrease the system performance."

The accurate mathematical model of FMU is built and features of sensor fault are analyzed. To improve the accuracy of sensor diagnosis, Kaiman filters are utilized to estimate the optimal outputs of dual-redundancy sensors both in the presence of process noise and measurement noise. However, the diagnosis results depend on the accuracy of system model, especially in the dynamic process. Therefore, an improved residual checking method based on a real time moving detection window is proposed to reduce the false alarm rate. In addition, the design criteria of window width and threshold value are given according to the requirements of control system. The proposed method is verified via simulation. Results show that when faults occur in a sensor, they can be accurately detected in time. Moreover, the method effectively avoids false alarm during the rising stage when the operating point changes."

In this paper, an equation is derived to calculate the fractional bandwidth (BW) of these two different methodologies. It is shown that for the upper region in the mm-wave spectrum, the acquired fractional BW, when constructing the AMC fully in the metal stack, seems promising. However, in the lower region of the mm-wave spectrum, the acquired fractional BW is rather poor and the lossy silicon substrate has to be included.

On the other hand, the detailed model could also be used for finding the sectional winding transfer functions (SWTFs), which were needed for electrical PD localization methods. Although for both applications the detailed model of windings is necessary, the influence of different parameters of the detailed model on FRA measurements could be different and their importance are not same.

        "abstract": "Constant current (CC) / Constant voltage (CV) is the most optimum algorithm applied for lithium-ion battery charging used in EVs. However, major issue during this mode of charging are the switching transients. Subsequently, smooth transition from CC to CV is required for minimizing switching losses and increasing the battery life expectancy. Generally, toggle switch is used to transit from CC to CV. It operates (CC to CV), when the output voltage reaches to predefined value of voltage. But due to the ripple in the output voltage, toggle switch changes its state from ON to OFF and OFF to ON. Hence, the output of the controller oscillate between CC to CV continuously. To mitigate this problem, a novel charging method, using Schmitt trigger, for optimum transition from CC to CV is proposed in this paper. Schmitt trigger operates in a specified band limit, which is decided by the voltage ripple. To verify this scheme, boost converter is modeled and its controllers for CC and CV mode are designed. Proposed scheme is implemented in MATLAB using real time simulator Opal-RT."

Hidden layers represent any combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, activation functions, and are fully defined within complex valued domain. The custom database of patches was designed using 3 classes and parameters of CV-CNN were observed in order to achieve the best accuracy results. The experimental results showed that accuracy of 86% can be achieved using a complex valued SAR patches applied to the complex valued CNN."

However, in some cases, improper design will lead to uneven grasping force, and it will not be able to grasp firmly or even have ejection phenomenon. So the optimization of the geometrical parameters is of great importance. In this paper, according to the designed three-degrees-of-freedom link-type underactuated manipulator, the mechanical model under grasping state is deduced by the principle of virtual work. Setting the average degree of grasping force as the optimization goal, the size and angle of pressure have been optimized by using MATLAB genetic algorithm toolbox and several suitable results have been obtained."

As the solar output is highly intermittent, the occurrence of power mismatch in the system will increase. Furthermore, the converter-based solar photovoltaic (PV) plant has zero inertia which will inevitably reduce the overall system's inertia and cause stability problem in the event of contingency or large power mismatch. In this regard, this paper aims to investigate the impacts of large-scale solar PV plant on power system's frequency response. Two IEEE test systems have been considered in this study, namely the IEEE 9 bus, and IEEE 39 bus test systems to investigate how different levels of large scale solar PV penetrations will impact on the overall system frequency response. The results suggest that the increasing share of solar generation in the generation mix will result in the reduction of total system inertia. Hence, the system becomes more susceptible to disturbance and contingency events. The study also shows that the system will collapse during the worst case contingency situation when the solar PV penetrations are over 40% of the system's generating capacity."

Airports are typically hosting a high number of constructions such as hangars, masts or shelters, so that multipath overlapping propagation is likely to happen. Especially when having multipath, the REDTOE algorithm has its benefits by improving the TOA accuracy. Herein we have shown that the REDTOE algorithm achieves better results than common known algorithms in a real-world LAM evaluated according ED-117 position accuracy specifications."

This paper focuses on the accuracy enhancement by incorporating breast surface boundary extraction into the inverse scattering analysis algorithm, known as distorted born iterative method (DBIM). Many studies have reported that the reconstruction accuracy of the DBIM or other inverse scattering algorithms largely depends on an initial estimate of boundary surrounding object, namely, skin surface shape of breast media. The Envelope method achieves highly accurate boundary extraction by processing a group of reflection time-delays. The accuracy of boundary extraction of Envelope depends on that of time-delay estimation, which is mostly processed by the filter based on waveform matching between observed and reference signals. However, the coupling effect between an antenna and a breast surface deforms an observed waveforms from reference one. To mitigate this problem, this paper introduces the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)-based waveform correction for more accurate boundary extraction. Numerical simulations based on realistic breast phantoms derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the accuracy for the DBIM based reconstruction of dielectric profile in highly heterogeneous case."

Considering that the transmit steering vector of FDA depends on the actual range and angle of the scattering point, while the propagation paths of time-delay modulation based deceptive jamming and real target are different, which implies that the transmit frequency of jamming is mismatched with its position in SAR image. Therefore it can be suppressed in transmit frequency domain by implementing beam forming. In the end, the effectiveness is verified by simulations."

Additionally, due to noise in thermographic images, a Cellular Nonlinear Network (CNN) based image enhancement method is applied. Then, in the following processing step, the Optical Flow (OF) method is employed to compensate local motion artifacts. The proposed algorithm is evaluated during an offline analysis of the recorded dataset of brain surgeries and the performance evaluation between different algorithms is made based on the determination of the Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC).

Developers establish links between tasks to express implicit dependencies that needs explicit handling--dependencies that often require the developers responsible for a given task to assess how changes in a linked task affect their own work and vice versa (i.e., change propagation). While seemingly useful, it is unknown if change propagation indeed coincides with task links. No study has investigated to what extent change propagation actually occurs between task pairs and whether it is able to serve as a metric for characterizing the underlying task dependency. In this paper, we study the temporal relationship between developer reading and changing of source code in relationship to task links. We identify seven situations that explain the varying correlation of change propagation with linked task pairs and find six motifs describing when change propagation occurs between non-linked task pairs. Our paper demonstrates that task links are indeed useful for recommending which artifacts to monitor for changes, which developers to involve in a task, or which tasks to inspect."

As a consequence of the pulsed operation of SAR, however, nadir echoes and range ambiguities may significantly affect the SAR image quality, if the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is not conveniently constrained in the design of spaceborne SAR systems. As these constrains typically limit both the swath width and the ambiguity performance of the SAR system, the investigation of novel concepts for nadir echo and range ambiguity suppression is of great interest. Waveform-encoded SAR allows suppression (not only smearing) of the nadir echoes and range ambiguities by means of waveform diversity on transmit and multifocus post-processing. This technique yields improved image quality and increased flexibility in the design of novel SAR systems."

This campaign is designed to measure and investigate these aspects of the channel. The paper includes analyses of the angular statistics and the dual directional power angular spectrum for a few locations. Next, the paths/clusters are mapped to a 2D map for visualisation of clusters. Finally, non-stationarity across the large array aperture is investigated in terms of angular statistics and power."

These objects can enhance usability of the urban environment by adapting parameters to individual needs of pedestrians. However, fairness problems occur if multiple pedestrians with incongruent needs wish to use the same object simultaneously. This research proposes a method for establishing a fair configuration of smart urban objects that are used by multiple pedestrians at the same time. Therefore, I develop an adaption rule based on economic fairness models to establish a welfare-egalitarian configuration of smart urban objects for the case of two concurrent users. The simulation-based evaluation provides evidence that using the adaption rule both enhances fairness and utilitarian welfare compared to using non-adaption."

A 28 dBi gain is obtained for 30 GHz and 24 dBi for 20 GHz. The zenith beam steering results from a linear displacement of the aperture (196 × 147 mm2) in front of a stationary feed. A scanning range of 50° was obtained with 2dB scan loss. Overall, the dual-band TA performs as well as if two independent single band apertures were designed."

As novel hardware development relies on underlying propagation channel models for the envisaged scenarios, which may range from deeply shadowed to line-of-sight, we focus here on obtaining and processing the relevant experimental datasets which enable us to develop or tune the particular models correctly. This paper studies three selected scenarios consisting of cluttered environment where individual propagation states of a Markov chain model are identified.

In order to tackle these problems, direct air-to-ground communication (DA2GC), where a direct link between a ground station and an airplane is established, is a promising solution. The resource utilization in DA2GC systems can be enhanced with the introduction of multi-user beamforming techniques, where each airplane has its dedicated beam and exploits a larger portion of the spectrum available to DA2GC. Even with multiuser beamforming technique, some airplanes may experience low data rates due to interference caused by beams aimed at airplanes in the mutual vicinity. The probability that two or more beams will interfere is higher with longer inter-site distance or wider beamwidth, which is often the case for DA2GC systems. To address significant research problem, we propose a coordinated resource allocation scheme with beam selection and spectrum allocation. The proposed beam selection scheme coordinates the neighboring base stations such that the number of airplanes sharing the same beam is minimized. In addition, the proposed coordinated spectrum allocation scheme maximizes the minimum amount of spectrum dedicated for each airplane. According to our results, the proposed coordinated beam selection with efficient spectrum allocation improves average capacity available per airplane by 60% in comparison with the uncoordinated scheme."

This algorithm introduces dynamic self-adaptive strategy and chaotic optimization strategy to solve the prematurity and low optimization ability of standard particle swarm optimization algorithm.

The UWB signal at carrier frequency of 4 GHz exhibits higher path loss compared to the 6 GHz signal in observed tunnel environment while the signal with 1 GHz bandwidth shows lower path loss compared to the 500 MHz signal. The delay spread is increasing with distance between transmitter and receiver; however, at the transmitter proximity a decrease of the rms delay spread is observed resulting in the rms delay spread minimum at 10 to 15 m from the transmitter. The three slope channel model for broadband UWB radio channels comprising of path loss and rms delay spread functions, is also proposed applying measured signal strength and channel impulse response values."

The Normal Boundary Intersection method is used not only for optimal trade-off points, but also to explore the opposite and adjoining boundaries. As a result, we get points on the boundary of the complete feasible performance space. The method described, is shown on a two stage transconductance amplifier in CMOS technology, with two different topology improvements. Three competing performance parameters are taken into account. Advantages of such performance space models could be graphical topology or technology comparison and high level modeling of transistor level circuits."

In the paper a generic ISAR processing chain is discussed which can be used for ISAR imaging and HRRP generation for arbitrary radar platform flight tracks. Furthermore, polarimetric ISAR imaging results of a controlled police ship and of ships of opportunity are presented.

In this paper, the basic form of IWs and scattering theory is investigated to simulate IWs in SAR images under different combination of radar parameters. The optimal observation conditions can be yield by comparing the results of simulation, which is advantageous to improve the precision of parameter estimation of IWs by SAR sensor. A new method is proposed to analyze the influence on internal wave imaging under different polarizations. The results of simulation and experiments prove that the proposed analyzing method is efficient for observation and inversion of IWs in SAR images."

        "abstract": "Due to transmit power limits and spherical spreading, the received RF power levels in radiative Wireless Power Transfer systems are very low. The RF-to-DC Power Conversion Efficiency of the receiver's rectifier therefore is of paramount importance. This efficiency can be increased by applying a multi-sine excitation at the transmitter. Here, we propose to use a pulse-delayed array excitation as a special form of multi-sine excitation. As reported earlier, this excitation will lead to the creation of a focal area with high energy density at the location of the receiver. In this paper, we discuss practical considerations for increasing the peak- and average-power level in the focal area. We find that, relative to an array excited with non-delayed pulses, we may expect at the focal position a peak-power gain up to the number of array elements squared and an average-power gain between zero and the number of array elements. The array size is in the order of the distance to the focal point. The array is best used for focusing in front of and to the side of the array, so that for a complete forward coverage two arrays should be used."

However, the question arises which geometry should be chosen for optimal measurement sensitivity to the material under test. Thus far, this question appears to go unanswered. In this paper, the suitability of the three most popular planar geometries is compared for material characterization. To this end, the impact of a material under test on the apparent properties (i.e. the equivalent homogeneous cross-sections) is examined. This is done for the complex permittivity and the complex permeability, using conformal mapping methods, full-wave simulations and measurements. It is shown that the coplanar waveguide (without conductor backing) is the most suitable structure of the three, since it is the most sensitive to changes in the properties of the material under test."

        "abstract": "One approach to improve road safety is to activate Passive Safety actuators adapted to the crash situation as early as possible. Advanced driver assistance systems and future automated driving systems use a combination of forward-looking sensors like radar, lidar or camera. Such sensors can also be used to provide (pre-)crash information which will help to select the most appropriate restraint strategy. To achieve the required Automotive Safety Integration Level (ASIL) for a critical process of triggering Passive Safety systems, the information from forward-looking sensors must be verified and validated. Hence, a validation sensor based on a different physical principle is required. New sensing concepts to validate the information from forward-looking sensors will complement existing technology. The challenge for the sensor is to confirm crash information within few milliseconds after the first contact (contact-sensing). For this purpose, this paper focuses on design of new sensing concepts. This paper describes two different approaches for contact-sensing. First approach is to include the sensing feature in the carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) material used in the vehicle structure. Second approach is to enhance the present pressure-hose sensor system used for pedestrian detection. It also describes the pre-investigation tests and their results. In the end, it explains a sensing principle to verify the position of impact and overlap from a vehicle crash. The results illustrate the potential of the different concepts."

In this paper, the optimization for sizing and placement of distributed renewable generators (DRGs) in the electrical distribution networks is presented. The optimum sizes and locations for the DRGs are determined to reduce the power loss in the distribution networks. The genetic algorithm (GA) has been used to solve the optimization problem using MATLAB. For the validation, results of this study are compared with other well-known heuristic optimization techniques and analytical approaches. The numerical studies on the IEEE 33 bus distribution network have revealed that the proposed algorithm is capable for finding the optimum size and place of DRG in the distribution networks.

        "abstract": "It has been industrial consensus that safety and security are vital for autonomous driving system. In this session, key functions of a typical electronic and electrical architecture of autonomous driving are reviewed in respect of safety requirements. Based on the analysis and world leading CAR OEMs' requirements, a safe SOC system architecture is proposed and addressed. Specifically, ASIL-x safety level is assigned for key autonomous function modules. A Vehicle level security structure is also discussed in the view of autonomous driving application. A typical use case of security solution for SOC is briefly illustrated in this session."

        "abstract": "Spatial multiplexing is a way to increase a capacity of modern wireless systems by decomposing the spatial domain in several independent channels. As a beamforming network, a hybrid architecture can be used that enables reduction of the number of RF transceiver channels and using a low-dimensional digital base-band signal processing. Fourier Rotman Lens, which provides beam patterns orthogonality, can be used as an analog part of the hybrid beamforming network, which can be modified by using additional power dividers to decrease the number of lens array ports. The simulated radiation patterns are discussed for different values of the number of outputs ports. The results of simulations have been verified by far-field measurements."
